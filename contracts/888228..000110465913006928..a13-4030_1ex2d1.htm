NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger_

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DLLCA, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub will cease and
the Company will continue its existence under Delaware law as the surviving
entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ").

 



 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VI_, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, 10019
at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the second

      
 

 



 

(2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent
shall agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective
time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and the Certificate of Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as the certificate of formation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of formation
of the Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may
be amended as provided therein or by Law, in each case consistent with the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(b) The Company LLC Agreement shall, by virtue of the Merger and the
Certificate of Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in
_Exhibit A_ hereto, consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section
5.8_.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Governance of the Surviving Entity_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
managing member of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
the managing member of the Surviving Entity immediately following the
Effective Time. The parties agree that there shall be no directors of the
Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Entity until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or upon their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect on Units_

 



 

Section 2.1. _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent GP, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section 2.2(h)_ and _Section
2.4_, each Common Unit issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding
in accordance with _Section 2.3_ as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.4563 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") Parent Units (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) _Equity of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, the membership interests in Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
membership interests in the Company (as the Surviving Entity). At the
Effective Time, the books and records of the Company shall be revised to
reflect the admission of Parent as a Member of the Company and the
simultaneous withdrawal of all other Members of the Company, and Parent GP and
Parent shall continue the existence of the Company (as the Surviving Entity)
without dissolution.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Units_. Any Company
Securities that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company, and any Company Securities owned immediately prior to the Effective
Time by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease
to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled
Company Securities, and any Company Securities owned by any other Subsidiary
of Parent or the Company shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units converted into
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of units in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_
and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Units to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_, in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_, without interest, and the right to be admitted as an
Additional Limited Partner of Parent. Parent GP hereby consents to the
admission (as an Additional Limited Partner) of each Unitholder who is issued
Parent Units in exchange for such Unitholders Common Units in accordance with
this _Article II_, upon the proper surrender of the Certificate representing
such Common Units. Upon such surrender of the Certificate (or upon a waiver of
the requirement to surrender a Certificate granted by Parent GP in its sole
discretion) and the recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner
of Parent on the books and records of Parent, such Person shall automatically
and effective as of the Effective Time be admitted to Parent as an Additional
Limited Partner and be

 



      
 

 



 

bound by the Parent Partnership Agreement as such. By its surrender of a
Certificate, or by its acceptance of Parent Units, a Unitholder confirms its
agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Parent
Partnership Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
three (3) business days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or
will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Common
Units, Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units and Phantom Units as of
the Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, to make
available for collection by hand, during customary business hours commencing
immediately after the Effective Time, if so elected by such holder of record),
whose Common Units, Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units and
Phantom Units were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Exchange Agent) in such forms as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of any fractional Common Units payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units, Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units and Phantom Units (and
tandem distribution equivalent rights), Parent Units (which shall be in non-
certificated book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient
to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or other evidence of Company Options, Company
UARs, Restricted Units and Phantom Units (and tandem distribution rights) (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.2(g)_ and any Parent Units sufficient to pay any Merger
Consideration, in each case, that may be payable from time to time following
the Effective Time. All cash and book-entry units representing Parent Units
deposited with the Exchange Agent or representing unit proceeds obtained
pursuant to Section 2.2(h) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or
paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
(i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Common Units, Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted
Units or Phantom Units (and tandem distribution rights) entitled to receive
such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests or in respect of
tandem distribution rights pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ and Parent shall
promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of Common Units, Company

 



      
 

 



 

Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units or Phantom Units (and tandem
distribution rights) entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of
any such losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in short term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30)
days.

 



 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units, Company Options, Company UARs,
Restricted Units or Phantom Units (and tandem distribution rights) that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a
Certificate (as applicable) and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) the number of Parent Units representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of Parent Units that such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with the provisions of _Article II_ and/or (ii) a check
denominated in U.S. dollars in the amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. The Merger Consideration
shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after receipt by the Exchange
Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the
foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Units or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion
of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of the Company of transfers of Common
Units. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time

 



       
 

 



 

shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged his, her or its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall not be liable to any holder of Common Units for any Merger
Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
holders of Common Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Units issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this _Section 2.2._ Following such surrender, subject to the
effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the Parent Units, if any, issued in exchange
therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such Parent Units with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Units
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of Parent Units, all Parent Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common
Units converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Unit (after taking into account all
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) delivered by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2(h)_, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of such fractional units representing such holders
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by reasonable and customary fees of the Exchange Agent
attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the " _unit proceeds_ ") in one or
more transactions of a number of Parent Units, such number equal to the excess
of (i) the aggregate number of Parent Units to be delivered to the Exchange
Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ over (ii) the aggregate number
of whole Parent Units to be distributed to the holders of Certificates
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ (such excess being, the " _Excess Units_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash unit proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional units was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional units. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the
certificates representing Parent Units that would otherwise receive fractional
units, shall sell the Excess Units at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE in
the manner provided in this _Section 2.2(h)_ and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. Until the unit proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of such Common

 



      
 

 



 

Units, or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
unit proceeds in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Common Units
(the " _Fractional Unit Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Fractional Unit Proceeds to which each holder of such Common
Units shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate
unit proceeds comprising the Fractional Unit Proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional unit interest to which such
holder of such Common Units would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional unit interests to which all
holders of such Common Units would otherwise be entitled. To the extent
applicable, each holder of Common Units shall be deemed to have consented for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or local
income tax purposes) to report the cash received for fractional Parent Units
in the Merger as a sale of a portion of the holders Common Units to Parent
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4).

 



 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to a holder of Common Units, Company Options, Company UARs,
Restricted Units and Phantom Units (and any tandem distribution equivalent
rights) such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law (and to the
extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding
shall be taken in Parent Units). To the extent amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the Common Units, Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units
and Phantom Units (and tandem distribution equivalent rights), as applicable,
in respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken in
Parent Units, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold
such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds
to the appropriate taxing authority.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Treatment of Company Options, Company UARs, Phantom Units and
Restricted Units_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Equity
Plan) will adopt resolutions, and the Company will take all other actions as
may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and each
Company Equity Plan (including, the award agreements in respect of awards
granted thereunder) to give effect to this _Section 2.3_ to provide that:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Each Company Option outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
vested or exercisable), as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part of
any holder of any Company Option, will be deemed net exercised for that number
of whole Common Units, which shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including, _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ), equal to,
rounded down to the nearest whole unit, (i) the number of Common Units subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (ii) the
number of whole and partial (computed to the nearest four decimal places)
Common Units with a Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the
applicable Company Equity Plan) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option. For illustration
purposes only, if (x) a Company Option to purchase one hundred (100) Common
Units with an exercise price per Common Unit of $1.00 is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Fair Market
Value of a Common Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is $2.00,
such Company Option would be converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 2.3(a)_ as follows: (100  Equivalent Option Common
Units)*(Exchange Ratio) = 22 Parent Units, where " _Equivalent Option Common
Units_ " = Aggregate exercise price of such Company Option / the Fair Market
Value of one Common Unit (with such quotient computed to the nearest four
decimal places).

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company UARs_. Each Company UAR outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable), as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the part of any holder of
any Company UAR, will be deemed net exercised for that number of whole Common
Units, which shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including, _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ), equal to, rounded down to
the nearest whole unit, (i) the number of Common Units subject to such Company
UAR immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (ii) the number of whole and
partial (computed to the nearest four decimal places) Common Units with a Fair
Market Value (as such term is defined in the applicable Company Equity Plan)
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the aggregate exercise
price of such Company UAR. For illustration purposes only, if (x) a Company
UAR in respect of one hundred (100) Common Units with an exercise price per
Common Unit of $1.00 is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Fair Market Value of a Common Unit as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time is $2.00, such Company UAR would be
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ as
follows: (100  Equivalent UAR Common Units)*(Exchange Ratio) = 22 Parent
Units, where " _Equivalent UAR Common Units_ " = Aggregate exercise price of
such Company UAR / the Fair Market Value of one Common Unit (with such
quotient computed to the nearest four decimal places).

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Phantom Units_. Each Phantom Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
in full (in the case of performance-based Phantom Units, based on a target
earned percentage of one hundred percent (100%)) and the restrictions with
respect thereto shall lapse, and each Common Unit deemed to be issued in

 



      
 

 



 

settlement thereof shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (including, _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ). In addition, any
tandem distribution equivalent rights payable with respect to each Phantom
Unit that vests pursuant to this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
vest in full and shall become immediately payable in cash.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Restricted Units_. Each Restricted Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
in full and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and each
Restricted Unit shall be treated as an issued and outstanding Common Unit as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (including, _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ).

 



 

(e) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all of the Company
Equity Plans, such termination to be effective at the Effective Time, and from
and after the Effective Time, all Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and
no Company Options, Company UARs, Restricted Units, Phantom Units or other
rights with respect to Common Units or other Company Securities shall be
granted or be outstanding thereunder, it being understood that the
terminations contemplated hereby shall in no respect limit Parents
obligations under this Section 2.3 with respect to Company Options, Company
UARs, Restricted Units and Phantom Units granted prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding Common Units or Parent Units shall have been changed into a
different number of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of
units or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, split, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction
and to provide the holders of Common Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

Section 2.5. _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

that it is applicable to such other section notwithstanding the omission of a
reference or cross reference thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in
such Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had,

Effect), the Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

requisite limited liability company, corporate, partnership or other
applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (" _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification

standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) All the outstanding limited liability company interests, partnership
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of the Company that are owned directly or indirectly by
the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid

Section 3.5. _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2010 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").
The Company SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case
of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company

 



      
 

 



 

SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date
of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments,
none of which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (x) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The principal executive officer and
the principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents,
and the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct
when made. The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
chief

 



      
 

 



 

executive officer and chief financial officer from giving the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without qualification, when
next due.

 



 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012 (the " _Balance
Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC
Documents filed by the Company and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to
be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as
have not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,

warrants to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being

_Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Parent GP and their Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the

Parent, as its sole member, and by Parent GP and the delegate of Parent GP, on
behalf of Parent and no other entity action on the part of the Parent Entities

Liens as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

vote or consent of the members of Merger Sub necessary to adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) None of the Parent Entities or any of their Subsidiaries holds any limited

hinder the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(B) result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2010 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Documents_ "). The Parent SEC Documents, as of their respective effective
dates (in the case of the Parent SEC Documents that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of
their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC
Documents), or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC staff with respect to the Parent SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of
the Parent Entities, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of
ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Boards of Directors of Parent GP and the delegate of
the Parent GP (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such

 



      
 

 



 

certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of Parent
has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of
Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances
that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial statements or any
Parent SEC Documents.

of their respective properties at law or in equity before any Governmental
Authority, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of any Governmental

and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their

conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of
Parent Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Parent Entities, threatened, except where such suspension or
cancellation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and since

the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event or condition
has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default
or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Government Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.9_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on

conditions to, or the consummation of, the transactions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.3. _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any
Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) to any physical or
electronic data room relating to a possible Alternative Proposal. Except as
permitted by this _Section 5.3_, (x) the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate,
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing confidential information)
or knowingly induce or take any other action intended to lead to any inquiries
or any proposals that constitute the submission of an Alternative Proposal,
(ii) except for a confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to _Section
5.3(b)_, enter into any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of
intent, agreement in principle, unit purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement or unit exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Alternative Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_
"), or (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly
approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any
Alternative Proposal and (y) within five (5) business days of receipt of a
written request of Parent following the receipt by the Company of any
Alternative Proposal, the Company shall publicly reconfirm the Company Board
Recommendation; _provided_ that, in the event that Parent requests such public
reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, then the Company may not
unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the five (5) business day period) or
condition the public reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation and
_provided_ _further_ that Parent shall not be permitted to make such request
on more than one (1) occasion in respect of each Alternative Proposal and each
material modification to an Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking of any
action described in clause (x)(iii) or the failure to take the action
described in clause (y) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Companys Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company unless such

 



      
 

 



 

violation is committed without the Knowledge of the Company and the Company
uses its reasonable best efforts to promptly cure such violation once the
Company is made aware of such violation.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Unitholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) the
Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior
Proposal and (iii) such Alternative Proposal did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 5.3_, then the Company may, subject to clauses (x)
and (y) below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information,
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company will not,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person unless the Company has, or
first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than
the provisions of the Company Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent (
_provided_ that such confidentiality agreement need not include "standstill"
provisions or similar restrictions) and (y) the Company will provide to Parent
non-public information about the Company or its Subsidiaries that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with providing or making available such non-public information to
such other Person.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Alternative
Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of
the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received by the
Company or that the Company has delivered to any third party making an
Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ and the
Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Unitholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, effect an Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 



 

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
(1) the Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal in the form to be
entered into and (2) any other relevant proposed transaction agreements), at
least five (5) calendar days in advance of its intention to take such action
with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such
notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than five (5) calendar
days prior to the Company Unitholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall
provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of
all such days, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that
any material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ and a new Notice Period, except that
such new Notice Period in connection with any material amendment shall be for
one (1) business day from the time Parent receives such notice (as opposed to
five (5) calendar days); and

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period the Company has negotiated, and has used
reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment
of the Company Board) a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions), outside of the ordinary course of business, of assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to
which twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Companys revenues or earnings
on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act)
of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or (D) merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company which is structured to permit such
Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Companys consolidated assets or equity interests; in
each case, other than the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written offer, obtained after
the date of this Agreement and not in breach of this Section 5.3 (other than
an immaterial breach), to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than fifty
percent (50%) of the outstanding equity securities of the Company or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third
party, which is on terms and conditions which the Company Board determines in
its good faith to be more favorable to the Companys Unitholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into
account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this
Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent in writing.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Unitholder Approval,
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, that the exercise of its fiduciary duties
requires such Adverse Recommendation Change. An " _Intervening Event_ " means,
with respect to the Company, a material event or circumstance that arises or
occurs after the date of this Agreement and was not, prior to the date of this
Agreement, reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Alternative
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a
violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change
may only be made in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, a public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_ ), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain
promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) business days after the date
of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties
hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date); and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transaction.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of (and supply to the other party) any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review in
advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any
communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the other party in
advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences. Parent shall have the principal responsibility
for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any clearances
required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall take the lead in all meetings and

 



      
 

 



 

communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
such clearances, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall consult in advance
with the Company and in good faith take the Companys views into account
regarding the overall strategy. Subject to _Section 5.6(b)_ , the parties
shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ in a manner so
as to preserve the applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company (including by causing their respective
Subsidiaries) agree to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any
objections that a Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y)
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date, and
including taking or agreeing to take the types of actions, but subject to the
limitations, described in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not,
without Parents prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction
or agree to any restriction on its business, and nothing in this _Section 5.4_
shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party may have to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ in a case where _Section 7.1_ permits such
termination or (ii) require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or
hold separate any part of the Companys, Parents or their respective
Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets (or a combination thereof), (B)
not compete in any geographic area or line of business, and/or (C) restrict
the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company or any of their
Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall be required to offer, accept or agree to the
actions in clauses (A), (B) and/or (C) if (and only if) the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) any such dispositions or holdings separate of,
and/or limitations or restrictions on, are, individually and in the aggregate,
immaterial to the businesses, operations and/or assets of the Company, Parent
or their respective Subsidiaries (provided that, in the case of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, for purposes of determining whether a business, operation or
asset is immaterial, it shall be assumed that Parent and its Subsidiaries are
of equivalent size to the current size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
each case taken as a whole) and (2) the effect of any such dispositions,
holdings separate, limitations and/or restrictions would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a loss (other than an
immaterial loss) of the reasonably expected benefits to Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.5. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may
be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with NASDAQ, the
NYSE or other national securities exchange as determined in the good faith
judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not

 



      
 

 



 

be required by this _Section 5.5_ to consult with any other party with respect
to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ and
matters related thereto or an Adverse Recommendation Change but nothing in
this proviso shall limit any obligation of the Company under _Section 5.3(d)_
to negotiate with Parent in good faith; provided, further, that each party and
their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are consistent
with statements made in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section
5.5_.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Each party shall
furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement). Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2012, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Company
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
January 17, 2013, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ " and, together with
the Company Confidentiality Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "),
each party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the
other party pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 



 

(b) This _Section 5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys position in any
pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if
such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other party or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would
not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to

 



      
 

 



 

disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-
house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such
contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which
appropriately designated Representatives of the other party shall be provided
access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being
requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the other party that
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 5.6(b)_ ) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 



 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to the Company or Parent, (ii) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions
to the Closing in _Article VI_ and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ ; _provided_ that, in the
case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the failure to comply with this _Section 5.7_
shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VI_ , or give rise to any right to terminate this
Agreement under _Article VII_ , if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or
failure would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_ , (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their capacity as a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another

 



      
 

 



 

corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with the Company) serving at the request of or on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall
mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that the Company
or any applicable Subsidiary would be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified
Person, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to (i)
indemnify and hold harmless against any cost or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any Proceeding, and provide advancement
of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents and
comparable governing instruments of any Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity shall, for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company
Charter Documents. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of
such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, and the Surviving Entity
shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Persons); provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Entity be required to expend pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ more than an
amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company
for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity would be
required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity shall
obtain the maximum amount of such insurance as is available for the Maximum
Amount. If the Company in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the
obligations of Parent under this _Section 5.8(c)_ , the Company may, prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in
their capacity as such; provided that in no event shall the cost of such
policy exceed six (6) times the Maximum Amount.

 



 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.8_ shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of the Company, the Surviving Entity or the DLLCA.
The provisions of this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.8_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
for a period of six (6) years and are expressly intended to benefit each of
the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification set forth in this _Section 5.8_ are asserted or made within
such six (6)-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent
and/or the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Entity set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ that the Company shall in any
event control such defense and/or settlement (subject to Section 5.2(a)(xiii))
and shall not be required to provide information if doing so would be
reasonably expected to threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or
other applicable legal privilege.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses, except Parent and the Company shall
each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Registration Statement and Proxy

Section 5.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units
(including derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or acquisitions
of Parent Units (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Units)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time; _provided_ that, nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company or
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to amend or terminate such
Company Benefit Plans to the extent permitted by their terms. For a period of
one (1) year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) to each employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ "), for so long as such Company
Employee remains an employee of the Parent, the Surviving Entity or any

 



      
 

 



 

of their respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period, base salary or
regular hourly wage which is the same as or no less favorable than that
provided to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and
(ii) to each Company Employee, for so long as such Company Employee remains an
employee of the Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates during the Continuation Period, eligibility to participate in the
employee benefit plans (including, cash incentive compensation plans)
sponsored or maintained by Kinder Morgan, Inc. (" _KMI_ ") on the same basis
as such eligibility to participate is provided to similarly situated employees
of KMI.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.12(a)_ ,
Parent shall maintain the Company Severance Plans in accordance with their
terms. In addition, to the extent any portion of the Companys assets are sold
during the Continuation Period, Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the purchaser of such assets provides the foregoing
benefits to the applicable employees who will be employees of the purchaser of
such assets through the end of the Continuation Period.

 



 

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time as required pursuant to this _Section 5.12(c)_ (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall apply to determine the crediting
rate under Parents cash balance plan but shall not apply with respect to
either benefit accrual attributable to any period prior to the Effective Time
under any defined benefit pension plan, or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, to the extent such
Company Employee is eligible to participate in a New Plan pursuant to _Section
5.12(a)_ , and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans of the same type as any Company Benefit
Plans in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that (i) a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Equity Plans will occur as of the
Effective Time and (ii) a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the Company Benefit Plans (other than any Company Equity Plans) set
forth in _Section 5.12(d)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule will occur
as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) At or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall pay to each Company Employee who participates in the
Companys Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _MICP_ "), a prorated
2013 annual bonus in an amount that is no less than the product of (A) such
Company Employees previously established target 2013 annual bonus (as
provided to Parent in writing prior to the date hereof), multiplied by (B) a
fraction equal to the number of days elapsed in 2013, through and including
the Closing Date, divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365).

 



 

(f) Parent shall honor, or shall cause to be honored, all vacation that is
accrued and unused by each of the Company Employees as of the Effective Time
and reflected on the balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Pre-Closing Vacation_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Companys
policies as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the
avoidance of doubt, including the terms of such policies regarding the
forfeiture and carryover of such Pre-Closing Vacation. Upon each Company
Employees termination of employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries other
than due to voluntary resignation or retirement (unless payment is required by
applicable Law), such Company Employee shall be entitled to a cash payment in
respect of any then-accrued and unused Pre-Closing Vacation (at a rate based
on such Company Employees base salary then in effect). All vacation and paid
time off that is accrued by each Company Employee following the Effective Time
shall be subject to the policies of KMI.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
Company Employee or any other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved,
to discharge or terminate the services of any Company Employee or any Person
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent and the Company Employee, (ii)
constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or
compensation plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent to maintain any
particular compensation or benefit plan, program arrangement, policy or
contract. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall create any third party rights in any
current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

Section 5.13. _Listing_. Parent shall cause the Parent Units to be issued
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement to be approved for listing
(subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) for trading on the NYSE prior
to the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.14. _Issuance of PIK Units; Dividends and Distributions_.

 



 

(a) Any Series A Preferred Units issued as PIK Units prior to the Closing Date
shall be issued as of the close of business on the record date for the
distribution of such Series A Preferred Units issued as PIK Units.

 



 

(b) After the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Company shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of
any distributions in respect of Parent Units, Common Units and Series A
Preferred Units and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it
being the intention of the parties that holders of Common Units or Series A
Preferred Units shall not receive, for any quarter, distributions both in
respect of Common Units or Series A Preferred Units and also distributions in
respect of Parent Units that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger,
but that they shall receive for any such quarter either: (i) only
distributions in respect of Common Units or Series A Units or (ii) only
distributions in respect of Parent Units that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as

the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any individual such representation or
warranty) does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an
executive officer of Parent to such effect.

to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or
other breach of or noncompliance with this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VII

 



 

 _Termination_

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the one
(1)-year anniversary of this Agreement (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available (x) to a party if the inability to satisfy
such condition was due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or (y) to a party if the other party has
filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as
permitted by _Section 8.8_;

 



 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;
or

 



 

(iii) if the Company Unitholders Meeting shall have concluded and the Company
Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained.

 



 

(c) by Parent:

(x) such Willful Breach is a result of an isolated action by a Person that is
a Representative of the Company (other than a director or officer of the
Company), (y) such Willful Breach was not caused by, or within the Knowledge
of, the Company and (z) the Company takes appropriate actions to remedy such
Willful Breach upon discovery thereof; _provided_ that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_
if Parent is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by the Company within thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice from Parent of such breach or failure; _provided_ that Parent shall not

(i) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth
in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would
(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _(b)_ and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void (other than the provisions in _Sections 5.10, 7.2_ and
_7.3_ and in the last sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_, and the provisions in
_Article VIII_, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement),
and there shall be no liability on the part of any Parent Entity or the
Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (i) the
Company and/or Parent may have liability as provided in _Section 7.3_, and
(ii) subject to _Section 7.3(f)_, nothing shall relieve any party hereto from
any liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby when required pursuant to this Agreement or
any party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ (as a result of a Restraint under an
Antitrust Law), or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ and, in the case of
this clause (B), at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in
at least one of _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ (as a result of a
Restraint under an Antitrust Law) shall not have been satisfied, (ii) the
failure of one or more of the conditions in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section
6.1(c)_ to be satisfied is not primarily caused by any Willful Breach of
_Section 5.4_ by the Company, and (iii) all other conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (and, in the
case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, such conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur),
then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee equal to $75,000,000
(the " _Antitrust Termination Fee_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event that (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the
date of the Company Unitholders Meeting (or, if the Company Unitholders
Meeting shall not have occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_) and (B) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_,
and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, an Alternative Proposal within twelve (12) months after the date
this Agreement is terminated, then the Company shall pay to Parent a
termination fee equal to $115,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), upon the
earlier of the public announcement that the Company has entered into such
definitive agreement or the consummation of any such transaction. For purposes
of this _Section 7.3(a)_, the term "Alternative Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.3(e)(i)_, except that the
references to "twenty-five percent (25%) or more" shall be deemed to be
references to "more than fifty percent (50%)."

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ in a case where an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred,
then the Company shall pay to Parent, within two (2) business days after the
date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_ as a result of a Willful Breach by Company, then the Company
shall pay to Parent, within two (2) business days after the date of
termination, the Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Any payment of the Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee shall be
made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the Termination
Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee required pursuant to this Section 7.3 when
due, such fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such
fee became past due, at a rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided
for in Section 2301 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if either
the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due or Parent shall
fail to pay the Antitrust Termination Fee when due, the party failing to pay
such fee shall also pay all of the other partys reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee. The Company and the Parent Entities acknowledge that the provisions
of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor the Parent
Entities would not enter into this Agreement. The parties agree that in the
event that the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the Company shall
have no further liability to any Parent Entity of any kind in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
The parties also agree that in the event that Parent pays the Antitrust
Termination Fee to the Company, Parent shall have no further liability to the
Company of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Antitrust Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company or any Parent Entity in exercising any right hereunder

other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole

shall relieve Parent, Parent GP or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding

their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section shall be null and void.

together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



 

Section 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Voting
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or
otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (b), (i)
the provisions of _Section 5.8_ and _Section 8.13_ and (ii) the right of the
Companys Unitholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a
claim by the Unitholders with respect to which may not be made unless and

Options, Restricted Units, Company UARs, Phantom Units and other equity awards
to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to

Section 8.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.7_,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 8.8. _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this _Section
8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate
remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party further agrees that no
party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

a. Neither the Member nor any of its respective members, employees, agents,
officers, directors, any of their respective affiliates, consultants,
employees or agents or any Officer (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be
liable to the Company or any other person or entity who has an interest in the
Company for any loss, damage, claim or expense (including attorneys fees)
incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such
Indemnified Party in good faith on behalf of the Company and in a manner
reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such
Indemnified Party by this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification and
advancement of expenses from the Company for any loss, damage, claim or
expense (including attorneys fees) incurred by such Indemnified Party by
reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Party
in good faith on behalf of the Company and in a manner reasonably believed to
be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Indemnified Party by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any indemnity under this
_Section 22(a)_ shall be provided out of and to the extent of Company assets
only, and the Member shall have no personal liability on account thereof.

 



 

b. To the fullest extent permitted by law as it currently exists and to such
greater extent as applicable law hereafter may permit, but subject to the
limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify
any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, unincorporated organization or other enterprise (including an
employee benefit plan), association, government agency or political
subdivision thereof or other entity (each, a " _Person_ ") who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to, or otherwise requires
representation of counsel in connection with, any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by
reason of the fact that such Person is or was a director of the Company ("
_Director_ ") or officer of the Company prior to the date hereto (a "
_Previous Officer_ "), is or was serving as a tax matters partner of the
Company or, at the request of the Company, as a director, officer, tax matters
partner, employee, partner, manager, fiduciary or trustee of any of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof (" _Company Group_ ") or any other Person
(each an " _Indemnitee_ ") or by reason of any action alleged to have been
taken or omitted in such capacity, against losses, expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, damages, penalties, interest, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Person acted in good
faith and in a manner the Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that such Persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which the Person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that the Persons conduct was unlawful.

 



 

c. To the fullest extent permitted by law, but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify any Person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or otherwise
requires representation of counsel in connection with, any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of the Company to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such Person was
serving as an Indemnitee, or by reason of any action alleged to have been
taken or omitted in such capacity, against losses, expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, damages, penalties, interest, liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Person acted in good
faith and in a manner the Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent
that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such Person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the
Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 



 

d. To the extent an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in _Section 22(b)_
or _Section 22(c)_, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
such Person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by such Person in connection therewith.

 



 

e. Any indemnification under _Section 22(b)_ or _Section 22(c)_ (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because the Person has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in such section. Such determination shall be made, with
respect to a Person who is a Director or Previous Officer at the time of such
determination, (i) by the Member, (ii) by a committee designated by the
Member, or (iii) if the Member so directs, by independent legal counsel in an
opinion of Counsel.

 



 

f. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending
any action, suit or proceeding referred to in _Section 22(b)_ or _Section
22(c)_ shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding and in advance of any determination that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right
to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company as authorized in _Section 22(b)_ through _Section
22(o)_.

 



 

g. The indemnification, advancement of expenses and other provisions of
_Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ shall be in addition to any other
rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to
any vote of the Member, as a

 



      
 

 



 

matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitees capacity as
an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as
to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the
Indemnitee.

 



 

h. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of its Directors
and Previous Officers, and such other Persons as the Member shall determine,
against any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be
incurred by such Person in connection with the Companys activities or such
Persons activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the
Company would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability
under the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

i. For purposes of the definition of Indemnitee in _Section 22(b)_, the
Company shall be deemed to have requested a Person to serve as fiduciary of an
employee benefit plan whenever the performance by such Person of his duties to
the Company also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such
Person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes
assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to
applicable law shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of _Section
22(b)_; and action taken or omitted by such Person with respect to any
employee benefit plan in the performance of such Persons duties for a purpose
reasonably believed by him to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Company.

 



 

j. Any indemnification pursuant to _Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_
shall be made only out of the assets of the Company, it being agreed that the
Member shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have
no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Company to
enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

 



 

k. An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
_Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ because the Indemnitee had an
interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies
if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

l. If a claim under _Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ is not paid in
full by the Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received by
the Company, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
reasonable expenses of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement
of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the
Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in this Agreement. Neither the failure of the
Company (including independent legal counsel or the Member) to have made a

 



      
 

 



 

determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement, nor an actual
determination by the Company (including independent legal counsel or the
Member) that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct, or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee,
be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or
brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified or to such advancement of expenses, under _Section
22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ or otherwise shall be on the Company.

 



 

m. The Company may indemnify any Person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (whether
or not an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that
the Person is or was an employee (other than an Officer or Previous Officer)
or agent of the Company, or, while serving as an employee (other than an
Officer or Previous Officer) or agent of the Company or is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, partner,
fiduciary, trustee or agent of another member of the Company Group or another
Person to the extent (i) permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as
from time to time in effect, and (ii) authorized by the Member. The Company
may, to the extent permitted by Delaware law and authorized by the Member, pay
expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by an such employee
or agent in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding, upon such terms and conditions as the Member determines.
The provisions of this _Section 22(m)_ shall not constitute a contract right
for any such employee or agent.

 



 

n. The indemnification, advancement of expenses and other provisions of
_Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not
be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

 



 

o. Except to the extent otherwise provided in _Section 22(m)_, the right to
be indemnified and to receive advancement of expenses in _Section 22(b)_
through _Section 22(o)_ shall be a contract right. No amendment, modification
or repeal of _Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ or any provision hereof
shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present
or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, nor the obligations of
the Company to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 22(b)_ through _Section 22(o)_ as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

23. _Assignments_. The Member may transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate, in whole or in part, its limited liability company interest, as determined in its sole discretion.

 



      
 

 



 

24. _Termination of Membership_. The rights of the Member to share in the profits and losses of the Company, to receive distributions and to assign its interest in the Company pursuant to _Section 23_ shall, on its dissolution, termination, winding-up, bankruptcy or other inability to act in such capacity, devolve on its legal representative for the purpose of settling its estate or administering its property.

 



 

25. _Dissolution_.

 



 

a. The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up upon the
first to occur of the following:

 



 

(i) the written consent of the Member;

 



 

(ii) the dissolution, termination, winding-up, bankruptcy, or other inability
to act in such capacity, of the Member; and

 



 

(iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of
the Act.

 



 

b. In the event of dissolution, the Company shall conduct only such activities
as are necessary to wind up its affairs (including the sale of the assets of
the Company in an orderly manner).

 



 

26. _Tax Matters_. For purposes of U.S. federal income taxation (and, to the extent applicable, state taxation), the Company shall be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner within the meaning of Section 301.7701-3 of the U.S. Department of Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No election shall be made that would prevent the Company from being disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.

 



 

27. _Separability of Provisions_. Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered separable and if for any reason any provision or provisions herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any existing or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this Agreement which are valid, enforceable and legal.

 



 

28. _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Member and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, its successors, legal representatives and assigns.

 



 

29. _Captions_. Captions contained in this Agreement are inserted as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

 



 

30. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Member with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

31. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed exclusively under, the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof), and all rights and remedies shall be governed by such laws.

 



 

32. _Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified, altered, supplemented or amended except pursuant to a written agreement executed and delivered by the Member. In addition, the terms or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the Member.
