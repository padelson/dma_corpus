amended as provided by law and such Articles of Incorporation.   (b) Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.   SECTION 2.05. Directors and
Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold

Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:   (a) each share of Company
Common Stock (all issued and outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock
being hereinafter collectively referred to  as the "Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than any Shares
to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.01(b) and  any Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined)) shall be canceled and shall  be converted
automatically, subject to Section 3.02 and Section 7.12(a),  into the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger     9         
Consideration (as defined below), payable upon surrender, in the manner 
provided in Section 3.02, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such 
Share. Each share of Company Common Stock issued with respect to options to 
acquire Company Common Stock that have been exercised prior to the  Effective
Time shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as issued  and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time.   For purposes of this Section
3.01(a):   "Merger Consideration" means the quotient determined by
dividing  the Net Aggregate Value by the number of Shares outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   "Net Aggregate Value" means
$150,000,000 less (i) the sum of (A)  the aggregate amount outstanding
(including accrued interest) as of  the end of the day of the Effective Time
under the Credit Agreement  plus (B) the aggregate amount outstanding
(including accrued interest)  as of the end of the day of the Effective Time
under all promissory  notes issued by the Company plus (C) the Company
Expense Amount (as  defined in Section 7.10) plus (D) $75,000 (one-half of
the agreed  credit balance accounts receivable amount) plus (E) $55,000 (one-
half  of the expected premium cost of the Environmental Insurance Policy), 
plus (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate amount outstanding (including  accrued
interest, except for the accrued interest on the six $450,000  notes
receivable from certain Breg executives) as of the end of the  day of the
Effective Time under all promissory notes held by the  Company (not including
the portion of any promissory note provided to  the Company in connection
with the exercise of Company Stock Options  for the payment of income and
employment taxes of the exercising  option holder that the Company will pay
to the applicable taxing  authorities after the date of the Effective Time)
plus (B) the  aggregate cash amount paid to the Company after the date of
this  Agreement and prior to the end of the day of the Effective Time
(other  than by providing a promissory note to the Company for the exercise
of  Company Stock Options, which instead will be taken into account under 
(ii)(A) hereof) in connection with the exercise of Company Stock  Options
pursuant to Section 3.04 plus (C) the amount of cash held by  the Company as
of the end of the day of the Effective Time (the  "Closing Cash") (not later
than two business days prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a good faith  estimate of the Closing Cash along with such
supporting information as  Parent may reasonably request), and plus or minus,
as the case may be,  (iii) the amount of any Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment  calculated pursuant to Section 3.06(a). Any cash payment made by
an  exercising option holder to exercise Company Stock Options after the 
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time shall be taken  into
account under (ii)(B) and not (ii)(C) hereof.   "Credit Agreement" means the
Credit Agreement, dated May 29,  2003, by and between U.S. Bank, N.A. and the
Company, as amended.   (b) each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be    
10        canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and   (c) each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
SECTION 3.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article III through
the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash
consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash out of the Exchange Fund. Except
as contemplated by Section 3.02(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal.   Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefore that amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a) in respect
of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate in accordance with
Section 3.01(a) (after taking into account all Shares then held by such
holder) less (i) the Per Share Escrow Amount (as defined below), which
represents the amount of cash that is to be placed in escrow with respect to
such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.02(c) below and (ii) any
withholding in accordance with Section 7.12(a) with respect to
such holder.   "Per Share Escrow Amount" means $12,000,000 divided by the
number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all     11        times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a).  
(c) Escrow Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the
Shareholders\' Representative shall enter into an escrow agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement") with an escrow agent selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Escrow Agent") substantially in
the form of Exhibit D hereto. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit into the escrow account (the
"Escrow Account") to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement the amount of cash equal to $12,000,000 (the cash so
deposited being the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Amount and all interest and
other amounts earned thereon (the "Cash Escrow Fund") shall be available to
compensate Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the other Parent Indemnified
Parties (as defined in Section 11.02(a)) for Losses (as defined in Section
11.02(a)) in accordance with the indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders under Article VIII and Article XI of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Cash Escrow Fund contributed on behalf
of each holder of Company Common Stock shall be in proportion to the number
of Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Distributions from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement.   (d) No Further Rights in Company
Common Stock. The cash issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.   (e) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of the Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III
shall thereafter look only to Parent for cash to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(a). Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f) No Liability.
None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (g)
Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law with respect to
the making of such payment or with respect to any exercise of Company Stock
Options prior to the Effective Time to the extent that such holder has not
already provided for the payment of withholding Taxes in connection with such
exercise. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent.     12         (h) Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
and with such customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a).   SECTION 3.03. Stock Transfer Books.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.   SECTION
3.04. Company Stock Options. In accordance with the provisions of the 1996
and 2000 Executive Stock Option Plans and the 1996 Sales Organizations\'
Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") and any
underlying stock option agreement pursuant to the plans, all options (the
"Company Stock Options") outstanding at the Effective Time under the Company
Stock Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the
holder thereof, and each holder of a terminated Company Stock Option shall
not be entitled to receive any consideration for such termination.
In accordance with the provisions of the Company Stock Option Plans and
any underlying stock option agreements pursuant to the plans, the Company
shall allow each holder of any Company Stock Option to exercise prior to the
Effective Time such Company Stock Option, whether or not otherwise
exercisable and whether or not otherwise vested. The exercise of Company
Stock Options may be effectuated by the exercising option holder providing a
promissory note to the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, for the exercise price and such option holder\'s applicable income
and employment taxes resulting from such exercise.   SECTION 3.05.
Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under the CGCL, Shares that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger who shall have neither voted in
favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance
with the CGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), if any, shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such Shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the CGCL,
except that all Dissenting Shares held by Shareholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Shares under the CGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.    
13         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the CGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.   SECTION 3.06. Working Capital Adjustment. (a) Not later than
three business days prior to the scheduled Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a schedule (the "Estimated Working Capital Schedule")
summarizing the Company\'s good faith estimate of the Total Current Assets,
the Total Current Liabilities and the resulting Working Capital of the
Company and the Subsidiary as of the end of the day of the Effective Time
(such estimated Working Capital being the "Estimated Closing Working
Capital"). The Company shall prepare the Estimated Working Capital Schedule
using the same accounting policies, methodologies, practices and assumptions
as used in the preparation of the Statement of Working Capital as of
September 30, 2003 attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "September 30 Statement
of Working Capital"). The Company shall provide Parent with such information
as Parent may reasonably request to verify the Estimated Working Capital
Schedule. The Net Aggregate Value shall be adjusted pursuant to clause (iii)
of the definition of Net Aggregate Value in Section 3.01(a) either (x) upward
by the amount the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than
$7,610,000 (the "Target Working Capital"), or (y) downward by the amount the
Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital
(such adjustment being the "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment").   (b) As
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 45 days, following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Shareholders\' Representative a
schedule (the "Final Working Capital Schedule") with reasonable supporting
detail summarizing Parent\'s calculation of the Total Current Assets, the
Total Current Liabilities and the resulting Working Capital of the
Company and the Subsidiary as of the end of the day of the Effective Time
(such Working Capital, subject to potential adjustments in accordance with
Section 3.06(c), being the "Final Closing Working Capital"). Parent shall
prepare the Final Working Capital Schedule using the same accounting
policies, methodologies, practices and assumptions as used in the preparation
of the September 30 Statement of Working Capital. Parent shall provide the
Shareholders\' Representative with such information as the Shareholders\'
Representative may reasonably request to verify the Final Working Capital
Schedule.   (c) The Shareholders\' Representative may dispute any amounts
reflected on the Final Working Capital Schedule, but only on the basis that
the Final Working Capital Schedule has not been prepared using the same
accounting policies, methodologies, practices and assumptions as used in
preparing the September 30 Statement of Working Capital; provided, however,
that the Shareholders\' Representative shall have notified Parent in writing
of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 days of
Parent\'s delivery of the Final Working Capital Schedule to the
Shareholders\' Representative. In the event of such a dispute, the
Shareholders\' Representative and Parent shall attempt to reconcile their
differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Shareholders\' Representative and
Parent. If the Shareholders\' Representative and Parent are unable to reach
a      14        resolution with such effect within 15 days after
receipt by Parent of the Shareholders\' Representative\'s written notice of
dispute, the Shareholders\' Representative and Parent shall submit the items
remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent accounting firm of
international reputation mutually acceptable to the Shareholders\'
Representative and Parent (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which shall,
within 30 days after such submission, deliver a report to Parent and the
Shareholders\' Representative setting forth the resolution of such disputed
items and the adjustment, if any, to be made to the Final Closing Working
Capital, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Shareholders\' Representative and Parent. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Shareholders\'
Representative and Parent in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
such disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items
so submitted. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.   (d) If
the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, the amount of the difference between the Estimated Closing Working
Capital and the Final Closing Working Capital shall be subject to
indemnification by the Shareholders from the Cash Escrow Fund as provided
in Section 11.02(a)(v). If the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the amount of the difference between
the Final Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
shall be paid by Parent to the Shareholders\' Representative on behalf of the
Shareholders to be distributed to the Shareholders by the Shareholders\'
Representative in proportion to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
held by each such Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company

performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any consent,

materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.06. Permits; Compliance. Except as set

necessary for each of the Company or the Subsidiary to own, lease and operate
its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
"Company Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received notice that any
suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no such suspension or cancellation is
threatened, except for such suspension or cancellation of Company
Permits that would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth in Section 4.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor the Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in

medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or other
benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all employment, termination,
severance or other contracts or agreements, including each stock option
agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, whether legally

respect to which the Company or the Subsidiary has any obligation or which
are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or the Subsidiary
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or the Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which the
Company or the Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA
in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in

Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has any express
or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to create or
incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any other employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (iii) to modify,
change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.   (b) None of the Plans
is a defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. None of the Plans is
a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or the
Subsidiary could incur liability     22         under Section
4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). Except as set forth in
Section 4.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule none of the Plans (i)
provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-
type benefits to any person, (ii) obligates the Company or the Subsidiary to
pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or
partially as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iii) obligates the Company or the Subsidiary to make any payment or provide
any benefit as a result of a "change in control," within the meaning of such
term under Section 280G of the Code. None of the Plans provides for
or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or the
Subsidiary except to the extent required by applicable Law. Each of the Plans
is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political subdivision
thereof.   (c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Subsidiary
have performed all material obligations required to be performed by them
under, are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and have
no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to
any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact
or event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
Action.   (d) Except as set forth on Section 4.10(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code (i) has timely received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions
applicable to the Plan for which determination letters are currently
available that the Plan is so qualified, (ii) may rely on an opinion letter
issued to a volume submitter plan sponsor with respect to a standardized plan
adopted by the Company in accordance with the requirements for such reliance,
or (iii) is the subject of an application for such a determination letter (or
has remaining time to apply for such a determination letter prior to the
expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury regulations or
IRS pronouncements), and each trust established in connection with any Plan
which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it
is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such letter
or letters from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.
Any trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 4.01(a) of the Code is intended to be tax-exempt
under Section 5.01(a) of the Code and such trust has been operated in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize its tax-exempt
status.   (e) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Plan. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary has incurred any liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than
liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in
the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer      23        Plan, and
no fact or event exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such liability.   (f) All contributions, premiums or payments required
to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due
dates, except to the extent any failure to be so paid would not be material.
All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and
no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental
Authority and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance.   (g) All directors, officers, management employees, and
technical and professional employees of the Company and the Subsidiary are
under written obligation to the Company and the Subsidiary to maintain in
confidence all confidential or proprietary information acquired by them in
the course of their employment and to assign to the Company and the
Subsidiary all inventions made by them within the scope of their employment
during such employment and for a reasonable period thereafter.   (h) In
addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Plan that is not subject to
United States law (a "Non-U.S. Benefit Plan"):   (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan required by Law or by
the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan  have been made, or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with normal  accounting practices;   (ii) the fair
market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan  funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to  procure or provide
for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual  or contingent)
accrued as of the date of this Agreement with respect to all  current and
former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according  to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine 
employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and neither the  Merger
nor any transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such  assets
or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations;  and  
(iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has  been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable 
regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has 
been operated and administered in all material respects in compliance with 
all applicable non-United States Laws and in accordance with the terms of 
such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.   SECTION 4.11. Labor and Employment Matters.

otherwise failed to comply with any provision of any such agreement or

appropriate Governmental Authority or are holding for payment not yet due to
such Governmental Authority all amounts required to be withheld from
employees of the Company or the Subsidiary and are not liable for any arrears
of wages, taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to comply with any of
the foregoing. Except as set forth in Section 4.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Subsidiary have paid in full
to all employees or adequately accrued in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other

respect to payment of wages, salary or overtime pay that is now pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, has been asserted or is threatened before

Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or
citation by, any Governmental Authority relating to employees or employment
practices. There is no charge or proceeding with respect to a violation of
any occupational safety or health standards that is now pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, has been asserted or is threatened with respect to
the Company or the Subsidiary. There is no charge of discrimination in

to the knowledge of the Company, has been asserted or is threatened before
the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any
other Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction in which the Company or
the Subsidiary has employed or employ any person.   SECTION 4.12. Property

arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective

however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any

Disclosure Schedule in effect on the date of the Closing (the
"Indemnification Agreements") in each case relating to indemnification of
such present or former director or officer of the Company and the Subsidiary
(together with any successor by operation of law, individually, an
"Indemnified Person" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") in
a manner that adversely affects the rights of such Indemnified Person
to indemnification thereunder, and (ii) to perform its obligations under
the Indemnification Agreements, or exercise any discretionary authority
thereunder, to the fullest extent permissible by Law to provide such
Indemnified Person with all rights to indemnification available thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a
waiver of, or otherwise operate to adversely affect, the existing rights of
the Indemnified Persons under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company in effect on the date of the Closing and the Indemnification
Agreements relating to the indemnification of any Indemnified Person.   (b)
Parent agrees that, for six years after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance policies indemnifying and holding harmless the Indemnified Persons
that were covered by such insurance prior to Closing with respect to any
actions or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, providing at least
$5,000,000 insurance coverage on terms no less advantageous to such persons
than the Company\'s existing policy covering such persons; provided that in
the event any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, coverage
under such insurance shall be continued in respect thereof until final
disposition of such claim.   (c) This Section 7.05 shall survive the
Closing, is intended to benefit the Company and the Indemnified Persons (each
of whom shall be entitled to enforce this Section 7.05 against Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be), and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

material respect and (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice     43        pursuant to this Section 7.06

party receiving such notice.   SECTION 7.07. Further Action; Reasonable Best

respective subsidiaries, or (B) limits Parent\'s freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the Subsidiary or

on any member of any affiliated group with which either of the Company and
the Subsidiary files or has filed a Tax return on a consolidated or combined
basis for a Tax period ending on or before the date of the Effective Time;
and (iv) Taxes imposed on Parent or the Company or the Subsidiary as a result
of any breach of warranty or misrepresentation under Section 4.14.   (b) In
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before the date of the Effective Time and ends after the date of the
Effective Time, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion
of the period ending on the date of the Effective Time shall be:   (i) in
the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or  related to income or
receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale  or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or  intangible) (other
than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement), deemed  equal to the amount
which would be payable if the taxable year ended with  the date of the
Effective Time (except that, solely for purposes of  determining the marginal
tax rate applicable to income or receipts during  such period in a
jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level  of income or
receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into  account if
appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes); and   (ii) in the case
of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) that  are imposed on a periodic
basis and measured by the level of any item,  deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the  case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes  for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction the  numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on  the date of the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the number  of calendar days in the entire period
(not taking into account any  adjustment in the amount of Tax as a result of
the Merger).   SECTION 8.02. Returns and Payments. The Company shall prepare
and file in a timely manner all Tax returns, reports and forms ("Returns")
relating to the Company and the Subsidiary that are due on or before or
relate to any Tax period ending on or before the date of the Effective Time
and any other Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary, including any
Returns for any Tax periods beginning before but ending after the date of the
Effective Time. Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary not yet filed for
any Tax period that begins on or before the date of the Effective Time ("Pre-
Effective Time Return") shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in
a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Company
and the Subsidiary (except to the extent counsel for the Company determines
there is no reasonable basis in law therefore or determines that a Return
cannot be so prepared and filed or an item so reported without being subject
to penalties). With respect to any Pre-Effective     
47        Time Return, the Shareholders\' Representative (as
hereinafter defined) shall have the right to review such Return and statement
prior to the filing of such Return and the Company agrees to discuss in good
faith the items reflected on such Return and any adjustments reasonably
requested by the Shareholders\' Representative. In the event there is a
dispute regarding any adjustment requested by the Shareholders\'
Representative that cannot be resolved by the parties within 30 days after
receipt by the Company of such requested adjustments, the Shareholders\'
Representative and the Company shall submit the items remaining in dispute
for resolution to an Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, within 30 days
after such submission, deliver a report to the Company and the Shareholders\'
Representative setting forth the resolution of such disputed items and the
adjustment, if any, to be made to the Return, and such report shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Shareholders\' Representative and the Company.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between the Shareholders\' Representative and the Company in the
same proportion that the aggregate amount of such disputed items submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by each such
party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the
total amount of such disputed items so submitted. The Shareholders and Parent
agree that any Tax deduction arising from the exercise of Company Stock
Options on or before the Effective Time shall be allocable to the appropriate
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the date of the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the Shareholders and Parent agree that the
federal income tax period of the Company shall end as of the end of the day
of the date of the Effective Time. The Shareholders and the Parent agree that
the Company shall claim the deductions arising from the exercise of the
Company Stock Options in the taxable year that includes the Effective
Time and any unused deductions or loss that are not used in the taxable year
that includes the Effective Time shall be carried back to prior taxable
years, to the extent permissible under law. The Shareholders shall be
entitled to any Tax refunds in accordance with Section 8.03. If for any state
or local income or franchise tax purposes the taxable year that includes the
Effective Time does not end as of the end of the day of the Effective Time,
then in addition to the Tax refund in accordance with Section 8.03, Parent
shall pay to the Shareholders the amount of any actual state or local tax
savings realized by the Company or members of its consolidated or combined
group for such taxable year that includes the Effective Time to the extent
such deductions offset income allocable to the portion of such taxable year
after the Effective Time pursuant to Section 8.01(b) and such deductions
could have otherwise been claimed as a refund if the taxable year had ended
on the day of the Effective Time. If (i) the Effective Time is on or after
January 1, 2004 and (ii) the Company is not entitled under such state or
local income or franchise tax law to carry back the deductions or losses to
prior taxable years, then Parent shall pay to the Shareholders the amount of
any actual tax savings realized by the Company or members of its consolidated
or combined group for taxable years beginning after the Effective Time to the
extent the Company would have been entitled to a refund of such state or
local taxes had the exercise of Company Stock Options and the date of the
Effective Time both occurred on December 31, 2003.   SECTION 8.03. Refunds.
Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to the
Company or the Subsidiary for any taxable period ending on or before the date
of the Effective Time or otherwise allocable to a portion of the taxable
period ending on the date of the Effective Time using the appropriate
allocation method set forth in Section 8.01(b) shall be the property of the
Shareholders, and if received by Parent or the Company or the Subsidiary
shall be payable promptly to the Shareholders\' Representative on behalf of
the      48         Shareholders to be distributed to the
Shareholders by the Shareholders\' Representative in proportion to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Shareholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence: (i) any
Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to the Shareholders through a reduction in
Tax liability) for a period before the date of the Effective Time arising out
of the carryback of a loss or credit incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiary in a taxable year ending after the date of the Effective Time that
is attributable to a period after the Effective Date using the appropriate
allocation method set forth in Section 8.01(b), as applicable, shall be the
property of Parent and, if received by the Shareholders, shall be payable
promptly to Parent; and (ii) if, as of such time, if any, as Parent shall
receive a refund that would be the property of the Shareholders and payable
to the Shareholders under the foregoing sentence, Taxes have been asserted in
writing that would be required to be indemnified by the Shareholders
hereunder, all or part of such refund up to an amount equal to 120% of such
asserted Taxes shall, at the option of Parent, be deposited in escrow for
satisfaction of any amounts indemnifiable under this Article VIII that
have been asserted or subsequently are asserted, until the time set forth in
Section 8.05 hereof or until the matter has been resolved, whichever is
earlier.   SECTION 8.04. Contests. (a) After the date of the Effective
Time, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders\' Representative in
writing of any written notice of a proposed adjustment or claim in an audit
or administrative or judicial proceeding involving Parent or the Company or
the Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be
grounds for indemnification under this Article VIII; provided, however, that
a failure to give such notice will not affect Parent\'s right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent, if any, that, but for such
failure, the Shareholders could have avoided the Tax liability in
question.   (b) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the date of
the Effective Time, provided that the Shareholders\' Representative on behalf
of all Shareholders acknowledges in writing the Shareholders\' liability
under this Agreement to hold Parent and the Company and the Subsidiary
harmless against the full amount of any adjustment that may be made as a
result of such audit or proceeding that relates to taxable periods ending on
or before the date of the Effective Time, the Shareholders\' Representative
shall have the right at the Shareholders\' expense to participate in and
control the conduct of such audit or proceeding but only to the extent that
such audit or proceeding relates solely to a potential adjustment for which
the Shareholders\' Representative has acknowledged the Shareholders\'
liability and the issue underlying the proposed adjustment if resolved would
not materially prejudice the Company or the Subsidiary from taking a contrary
position for any period ending after the date of the Effective Time with
respect to such recurring issue. The Shareholders\' Representative shall keep
Parent informed of the progress of any such audit or proceeding and if it
appears in the reasonable discretion of Parent that such audit or proceeding
may adversely affect Parent, Parent also may participate in any such audit or
proceeding at its expense. If the Shareholders\' Representative does not
assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Parent may defend the
same in such manner as it may deem appropriate at its expense, including, but
not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving five
days prior written notice to the Shareholders\' Representative setting forth
the terms and conditions of settlement. In the event that a potential
adjustment as to which the Shareholders\' Representative has acknowledged the
Shareholders\' liability is present in the same     
49         proceeding as a potential adjustment for which Parent
would be liable, Parent shall have the right at its expense, to control the
audit or proceeding with respect to the latter potential adjustment.   (c)
With respect to an audit or proceeding that relates to a potential adjustment
for which both the Shareholders (as evidenced by their acknowledgement under
this Section 8.04) and Parent or the Company or the Subsidiary could be
liable, or which involves a taxable period ending after the Effective Time
but includes the Effective Time (and the Shareholders\' Representative has
acknowledged in writing the Shareholders\' portion of the tax liability under
Section 8.01(b)) or an issue that recurs for any period ending after the date
of the Effective Time (whether or not the subject of audit at such time) that
the Shareholders\' Representative does not control pursuant to Section
8.04(b) above, (i) each of the Shareholders\' Representative and Parent may
participate in the audit or proceeding at their respective expense, and
(ii) the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would
bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any
corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future Tax
periods. The principle set forth in the preceding sentence shall govern also
for purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (in
particular, choice of judicial forum) in situation in which separate issues
are otherwise controlled hereunder by Parent and the Shareholders\'
Representative.   (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.04(b) above,
neither Parent nor the Shareholders\' Representative shall enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or
proceeding which would adversely affect the other party for such year or a
subsequent year without the written consent of the other party, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld. Parent and the Shareholders agree to
cooperate, and Parent agrees to cause the Company and the Subsidiary to
cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any audit or
proceeding.   SECTION 8.05. Time of Payment. Payment by the Shareholders of
any amounts due under this Article VIII in respect of Taxes shall be made (i)
at least three business days before the due date of the applicable estimated
or final tax return required to be filed by Parent on which is required to
be reported income for a period ending after the date of the Effective Time
for which the Shareholders are responsible under Sections 8.01(a) and
8.01(b) without regard to whether the return shows overall net income or loss
for such period, and (ii) within three business days following an agreement
between the Shareholders and Parent that an indemnity amount is payable, an
assessment of a Tax by a taxing authority, or a "determination" as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code. If liability under this Article VIII is in
respect of costs or expenses other than Taxes, payment by the Shareholders of
any amounts due under this Article VIII shall be made within five business
days after the date when the Shareholders have been notified by Parent that
the Shareholders have a liability for a determinable amount under this
Article VIII and is provided with calculations or other materials supporting
such liability.   SECTION 8.06. Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The
Shareholders and Parent will (and Parent after the Effective Time will cause
the Company and the Subsidiary to) provide the others with such cooperation
and information as any of them reasonably may request of the others in filing
any Return, amended Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or
furnishing information to     50        parties subsequently
desiring to purchase either of the Company or the Subsidiary or a part of the
business from Parent. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Shareholders and Parent shall
(and Parent after the Effective Time will cause the Company and the
Subsidiary to) retain all Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in their possession relating to Tax matters of the
Company and the Subsidiary for each taxable period first ending after the
date of the Effective Time and for all prior taxable periods until the later
of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions
except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such
extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) six years following the
due date (without extension) for such Returns. Any information obtained under
this Section 8.06 shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.   SECTION 8.07. Characterization
of Payments. Parent and the Shareholders agree to treat all payments made by
any of them to or for the benefit of the others (including any payments to
the Company or any Subsidiary) under this Article VIII or under Article XI or
other indemnity provisions of this agreement and for any misrepresentations
or breach of warranties or covenants as adjustments to the purchase price or
as capital contributions for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall
govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the laws of a particular
jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in
an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant party on an after-Tax basis
(it being understood that in the unlikely event that a payment is made on an
after-tax basis, any additional payment due pursuant to this Section 8.07
shall be reduced by any tax benefits allowable to the Company, any Subsidiary
or Parent because of the adjustment giving rise to the indemnification).

follows:   (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly 
authorized by the Parent Board and the Company Board; or   (b) by either
Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not  have occurred on or

Breach"); provided, however, that, if such  Terminating Company Breach is

of any representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in  this Agreement or the Voting and Subscription

Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be
no liability under this Agreement on the part of any party hereto, except
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.   SECTION 10.03. Amendment.
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on
behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Shareholders, no amendment may be made that would reduce the
amount or change the type of consideration into which each Share shall be
converted upon consummation of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.  
SECTION 10.04. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in

an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby.      56         ARTICLE XI   INDEMNIFICATION  
SECTION 11.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties.
The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Voting
and Subscription Agreement and the Subscription Agreements (collectively,
the "Acquisition Documents") shall survive the Effective Time for a period of
two years. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of a party hereto
with respect to such party\'s representations and warranties shall be reduced
by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of another party
hereto. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to the expiration
of the applicable representations and warranties by a party hereto to another
party hereto, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive
as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.   SECTION
11.02. Indemnification by the Shareholders. (a) After the Effective Time,
Parent and its affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and
held harmless by each holder of shares of Company Common Stock as of

investigating or settling claims) actually suffered or incurred by them
(including in connection with any action brought or otherwise initiated by
any of them) (hereinafter, a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:  
(i) the breach of any representation or warranty (without giving  effect to
any qualification as to materiality or Company Material Adverse  Effect (or
similar qualifications) contained therein in determining the  amount of any
Loss) made by the Company or such Shareholder in the  Acquisition Documents
as of the date of this Agreement or as if such  representation and warranty
was made on and as of the date of the Effective  Time; provided, however,
that no Shareholder shall be liable for any breach  of any representation or
warranty made by any other Shareholder in the  Voting and Subscription
Agreement or the Subscription Agreements;   (ii) the breach of any covenant
or agreement made by the Company  or such Shareholder in the Acquisition

obligations of third parties.   SECTION 11.03. Indemnification by Parent.
(a) After the Effective Time, the Shareholders and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified

representation or warranty (without giving  effect to any qualification as to

indemnification payment by Parent with respect to any  indemnifiable Loss
otherwise payable under Section 11.03(a)(i) and (ii) and  arising out of or

Parent\'s obligation under Section 3.02(a) to deposit cash  sufficient to pay
the aggregate cash consideration pursuant to Section  3.02) shall be payable

aggregate cash consideration pursuant to Section  3.02) that may be recovered
from Parent shall be limited to $12,000,000;  and   (iii) no Loss shall be
deemed to have been sustained by any  Shareholder Indemnified Party to the

purposes of this Section 11.04, a party against which indemnification may be
sought is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party" and the party which may be
entitled to indemnification is referred to as the "Indemnified Party".  
(b) The obligations and liabilities of Indemnifying Parties under
this Article XI with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party
which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article XI
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and    
59         contingent upon the following additional terms and
conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give all Indemnifying Parties notice of
such Third Party Claim as promptly as practicable after the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release an Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article XI except to the extent that such Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The notice of claim shall
describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving
rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of
the amount arising therefrom.   (c) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense
and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do
so to the Indemnified Party within 10 days of the receipt of such notice from
the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that, if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party, in its reasonable
discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party
determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any
such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under the Indemnifying Party\'s control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such
Third Party Claim may be settled by any party conducting the defense against
such claim without the prior written consent of the other party unless the
other party and its affiliates is released in full in connection with such
settlement.   SECTION 11.05. Shareholders\' Representative. Bradley R. Mason
(such person and any successor or successors being the "Shareholders\'
Representative") shall act as the representative of the Shareholders, and
shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Shareholders and to take any and
all actions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders\'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, with respect to
any claims (including the settlement thereof) made by Parent or the
Shareholders for indemnification pursuant to Article VIII or this Article XI
of this Agreement and with respect to any actions to be taken by the
Shareholders\' Representative pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
The Shareholders shall be bound by all actions taken by the Shareholders\'
Representative in its capacity thereof that are within the authority granted
herein. The Shareholders\' Representative shall at all times act in his or
her capacity as Shareholders\' Representative in a manner that
the Shareholders\' Representative believes in good faith to be in the best
interest of the Shareholders. Neither the Shareholders\' Representative nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any
person for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to
be taken, under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except in the case of
its gross     60        negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. The Shareholders\' Representative may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The
Shareholders\' Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. As to any matters not
expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Shareholders\' Representative shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action. Each Shareholder severally shall indemnify and
hold harmless and reimburse the Shareholders\' Representative from
and against such Shareholder\'s ratable share of any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by the
Shareholders\' Representative arising out of or resulting from any action
taken or omitted to be taken by the Shareholders\' Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, other than such liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
Shareholders\' Representative\'s gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, (a) the Shareholders\' Representative is not authorized to, and
shall not, accept on behalf of any Shareholder any Merger Consideration to
which such Shareholder is entitled under this Agreement and (b) the
Shareholders\' Representative shall not in any manner exercise, or seek to
exercise, any voting power whatsoever with respect to shares of capital stock
of the Company or Parent now or hereafter owned of record or beneficially by
any Shareholder unless the Shareholders\' Representative is expressly
authorized to do so in a writing signed by such Shareholder. In all matters
relating to this Article XI, the Shareholders\' Representative shall be the
only party entitled to assert the rights of the Shareholders, and the
Shareholders\' Representative shall perform all of the obligations of the
Shareholders hereunder. Parent shall be entitled to rely on all statements,
representations and decisions of the Shareholders\' Representative.

warranty contained in the Acquisition Documents and for any other claim
