ARTICLE II



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK





Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
or any holder of any shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company
("Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:



(a)Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, no par value per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.



(b)Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



(c)Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shareholder Shares and shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $25.00 without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time
of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by certificates ("Book-Entry
Shares") and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2(b) (subject to any applicable withholding Tax).



(d)Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a shareholder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such
shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Part
13 of the URBCA (the "Dissenting Shareholder Shares", and each shareholder
holding Dissenting Shareholder Shares, a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Shareholder pursuant to Section 1302 of the URBCA (and as of the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shareholder Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting
Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Part 13 of the URBCA), unless and until such Dissenting
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost rights to payment under Part 13 of the URBCA. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such Dissenting Shareholder's shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(a), subject to any
applicable withholding Tax. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for payment of the fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the URBCA and received by the Company relating to
shareholders' dissenters' rights under Part 13 of the URBCA and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for payment of fair value under the URBCA. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect
to any such demands for payment or settle or offer to settle any such demands
for payment.



Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.



(a)Paying Agent; Investment by Paying Agent of Funds. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging shares of
Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent. Parent shall irrevocably
deposit, or cause to be deposited, the aggregate Merger Consideration with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shareholder Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.1(b)) with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. The aggregate
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock and as reasonably
directed by Parent, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Laws of a state of
the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other income from such
investments shall become part of the funds held by the Paying Agent for
purposes of paying the Merger Consideration. No investment or investment
losses resulting from such investment by the Paying Agent of the aggregate
Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article II, and Parent
shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through
any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.2(a). No investment by the
Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Paying
Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to pay the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II without interest.



(b)Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case
of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required
withholding Taxes, the Merger Consideration, for each share of Company Common
Stock surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (A) the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II.



(c)Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.



(d)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.



(e)Termination of Fund. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II, and thereafter
Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Article II shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.



(f)No Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(g)Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or Company
Performance Share Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or under any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and
the Paying Agent shall cooperate with such holders in all reasonable respects,
and in compliance with applicable Law, to minimize the amount of any
applicable withholding.





Section 2.3 Treatment of Equity Awards.



(a)Company RSUs. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is outstanding shall be converted into a vested right to receive cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration.



(b)Company Performance Share Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Performance Share Award that is outstanding (including any
Company Performance Share Award with respect to which the applicable
performance period has ended, but which Company Performance Share Award has

amount equal to the greater of (i) the target number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share Award, multiplied by
the Merger Consideration and (ii) the actual number of shares of Company
Common Stock to which the holder of such Company Performance Share Award would
be entitled based on actual performance with respect to the applicable
performance period multiplied by the Merger Consideration; provided that if
any outstanding Company Performance Share Award that is unvested as of the
date hereof becomes vested and settled pursuant to the terms of the applicable
award agreement and/or Company Stock Plan prior to the Effective Time then,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of such Company
Performance Share Award shall be issued such number of shares of Company
Common Stock, if any, equal to the excess of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would have vested and been settled in respect of
such Company Performance Share Award if the performance goals or targets

subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option whose per share exercise price equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled without any payment.



(e)Company Stock Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each right
of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common Stock
or benefits measured by the value of Company Common Stock, and each award of
any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock that may be held,
awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock
Plans and any other Company Plans, other than Company RSUs, Company

(collectively, the "Company Awards"), shall be converted into an obligation to
pay, at the time specified in the applicable plan, agreement or arrangement,
an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. Such obligation shall be payable
or distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such Company Awards (or, if earlier, on the death of
the holder thereof) and, prior to the time of distribution, such amounts shall
be permitted to be deemed invested in a permitted investment option under the
applicable agreement, plan or arrangement.



(f)Accumulated Dividends. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall distribute all Accumulated Dividends to the applicable holders of
Company RSUs and Company Awards.

withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company RSUs, Company Performance Share Awards,
Company Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Awards or
Accumulated Dividends in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation.



(h)Funding. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to
fulfill the obligations under this Section 2.3. All payments required under
this Section 2.3 shall be made through the Company's payroll not later than

capital stock of the Company (or any other securities convertible or
exchangeable therefor) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, or any similar event, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
2.4 shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such
change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant
to this Agreement.

refusal under, any Company Material Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, or under any Company Permit or result in
the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien), upon any of the

Section 3.5 Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a)The Company, Questar Gas Company and Questar Pipeline Company
(collectively, the "Reporting Companies") have filed with or furnished to the
SEC, on a timely basis, all registration statements, reports, proxy statements and other documents that such companies
were required to file or furnish since January 1, 2014 (collectively, and in
each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, as such statements, reports and documents
may have been amended since the date of their filing, the "Company SEC
Documents"). As of their respective effective dates (in the case of Company
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective filing dates
(in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), or in the case of amendments
thereto, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of
the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended, the
date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.



(b)Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Document (but only amendments, restatements or
corrections prior to the date of this Agreement in the case of any Company SEC
Document with a filing or effective date prior to the date of this Agreement),
as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, the financial statements
(consolidated, as applicable) of each of the Reporting Companies included in

with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except (A) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (B) as permitted by

financial position (consolidated, as applicable) of each of the Reporting
Companies and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the results of its
operations and cash flows (consolidated, as applicable), as of each of the
dates and for the periods shown, as applicable, in conformity with GAAP.



(c)Each Reporting Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Each
Reporting Company's disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by such
Reporting Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to such Reporting Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, the
Company, for and on behalf of each Reporting Company, has disclosed to the
Company's auditors and to the audit and finance committee of the Company Board
(i) any and all "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect, in any material respect, such Reporting
Company's ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in such Reporting Company's internal control over financial
reporting, and any such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed, if any,
has been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.



(d)None of the Reporting Companies or any Subsidiary of any Reporting Company
has any liabilities which would be required to be reflected or reserved
against on a balance sheet (consolidated, as applicable) of such Reporting
Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except for liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet of such
Reporting Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2015 (the "Balance

Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014 under applicable
state or federal Laws specifically governing the regulation of public
utilities, Environmental Laws, exploration and production of Hydrocarbons and

with the applicable Governmental Authority (including all forms, statements,
reports, agreements (oral or written) and all documents, exhibits, amendments
and supplements appertaining thereto (collectively, "Regulatory Filings")),
and all such Regulatory Filings complied, as of their respective dates, with
all applicable requirements of the applicable Laws, except for Regulatory
Filings the failure of which to make or the failure of which to make in
compliance with all applicable requirements of the applicable Laws have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. From January 1, 2015 to the date of

of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and

Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.8 Compliance With Laws; Permits. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with all laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, rules,

Governmental Authorities (collectively, "Laws") applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their properties or assets are
bound, except for instances of non-compliance as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries hold, and are in compliance with, all licenses, franchises,
permits, certificates, approvals, variances, orders, registrations and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities required by Law for the conduct
of their respective businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively,

Company Material Adverse Effect. No action or investigation is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to suspend, modify, disallow payment
under, cancel, revoke, remove or withdraw any material Company Permit where
such suspension, modification, cancellation, revocation, removal or withdrawal
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to materially affect the ability of the Company and its
applicable Subsidiaries to continue to provide service following the
expiration of any franchise agreement or to renew any franchise agreement,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no pending challenge or
dispute regarding arrangements among any of the Company and its Affiliates
that would materially affect implementation of the Company's or any of its
applicable Subsidiaries' drilling programs for the benefit of Questar Gas

Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "Company Pension Plan") have received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or has filed a timely application

have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each applicable
Subsidiary (A) are in compliance with all valuation agreements, and settlement

Section 4.4 Brokers and Other Advisors. Except for fees which will be paid by
Parent, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is
entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee,

Parent, threatened, Claim against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling
or decree imposed upon Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before any Governmental Authority, that

Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as

the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar,
that Parent and Merger Sub are making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, furnished
to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans
or cost-related plans), and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or

looking information, business plans or cost-related plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,

(b)During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, or delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the Transactions.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may, and may
cause any of its Subsidiaries to, take reasonable actions in compliance with
applicable Law with respect to any operational emergencies (including any
restoration measures in response to any hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood,
earthquake or other natural disaster or weather-related event, circumstance or
development), equipment failures, outages or an immediate and material threat
to the health or safety of natural Persons.



(d)Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries may (i) continue to make Regulatory Filings in the ordinary
course of business, including those filings described on Section 5.1(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) respond (after reasonable consultation with
Parent) to Regulatory Filings made by other parties in which the Company or
one or more of its Subsidiaries is an interested party, and (iii) take any
other action contemplated by or described in any such state or federal filings
or other submissions filed or submitted in connection with such Regulatory
Filings in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that Company
shall keep Parent promptly informed of any material communications or meetings
with any Governmental Authority with respect to rate cases and shall provide
copies of any written communications or materials, shall consult with Parent
and give Parent a reasonable opportunity, within the time constraints imposed in such
rate cases, to comment on material written communications or materials
submitted to any Governmental Authority, in each case with respect to any rate
cases, which Company shall consider in good faith, and at the request of
Parent, provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in any material
meeting or communications related thereto. Parent shall have the opportunity
to review and comment on all economic aspects of any rate case filing and
shall have the right to approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) any settlement of any rate case and rate
case filing insofar as it would reasonably be expected to affect any material
aspect of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time.



(e) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to sell, dispose of, abandon, transfer or otherwise convey those
certain assets referenced on Section 5.1(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status
of such transactions and Parent shall have the right to consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to any definitive documentation
reflecting the foregoing.



(f)Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that its firm transportation and firm storage contracts are
reviewed and renewed at levels that would maintain adequate peak-day gas
supplies for customers.



(g)Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate and coordinate with Parent with respect to the transition
matters set forth on Section 5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



Section 5.2 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting.

(a)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall cooperate with the
Company with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company, with Parent's
cooperation, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or
its staff concerning the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees that (i) except
with respect to any information supplied in writing to the Company by Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement, the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, on the date it is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company will
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with respect to, the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and with the Company considering in
good faith such comments; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply with respect to a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or any matters relating thereto. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing
to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to it
as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub agrees that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by
reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or Merger Sub which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
Parent (or Merger Sub, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the Company
so that it may file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company. If, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or
any of its respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered
by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and the Company shall
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company.



(b)The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company's shareholders,
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and the NYSE
rules, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to
consider the approval of this Agreement, the plan of merger and such other
matters as may be then reasonably required (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the "Company Shareholders Meeting"); provided, however,
that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company
Shareholders Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Company's shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting as
necessary under applicable Law or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of
votes in order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Except if there has
been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section
5.3(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and
secure the Company Shareholder Approval.

(c)Subject to Section 5.3 and the right of the Company Board to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant thereto, unless and until there has
been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.3,
the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the preliminary
and definitive Proxy Statement. Subject to the Company's right to terminate
this Agreement under Section 7.1(d)(ii), the Company's obligations under this
Section 5.2 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal or
communication to the Company of a Takeover Proposal, or by the withdrawal or
modification by the Company Board of the Company Board Recommendation.



Section 5.3 No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation.

(a)The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers and employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' respective
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover
Proposal or the making or consummation thereof or (ii) enter into, or
otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify such Person of the
existence of the provisions of this Section 5.3) or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any non-public material information in connection with,
any Takeover Proposal.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) and the Company's Representatives may engage in negotiations and
discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to, any Person
making such Takeover Proposal and any of its Representatives or potential
sources of financing if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial advisors, that
such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that failure to take such actions would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that prior to engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, or
furnishing any non-public information to, any such Person or its
Representatives, the Company and the Person making such Takeover Proposal
shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
will promptly (and in any event within the later of twenty-four (24) hours and
5:00 p.m. Salt Lake City time on the next Business Day) notify Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent promptly informed
(and in any event within the later of twenty-four (24) hours and 5:00 p.m.
Salt Lake City time on the next Business Day) in all material respects of the
status of and material communications relating to such Takeover Proposal
(including any change in the price or other material terms thereof). The
Company shall not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any
provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person unless the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.



(c)Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement or (D) fail to recommend against any Takeover Proposal subject
to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation
statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so
requests reaffirmation in writing (provided, that Parent shall be entitled to
make such a written request for reaffirmation only once for each Takeover
Proposal and once for each material amendment to such Takeover Proposal) (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to herein as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or commitment (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (a "Company Acquisition
Agreement"). 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii)), if (i) (A) a Company Intervening
Event has occurred or (B) the Company has received a Superior Proposal other
than as a result of a breach of this Section 5.3 (other than immaterial
breach), in each case, if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event or in response to
the receipt of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(ii) (A) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to
make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking
such action to the effect that, absent any modification to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(d)(ii), which notice shall specify the basis for such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or termination and attaching the most current
draft of any Company Acquisition Agreement and any other material documents
with respect to, the Superior Proposal (or, if no such draft exists, a summary
of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), if applicable
(a "Notice of Recommendation Change") (it being understood that such Notice of
Recommendation Change shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and that any change in price or material revision or
amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if applicable, shall require a
new notice to which the provisions of clauses (ii)(A), (B) and (C) of this
Section 5.3(d) shall apply mutatis mutandis except that, in the case of such a
new notice, all references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 5.3(d)
shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days); (B) during such four (4)
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent
and its Representatives regarding any modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that Parent proposes to make; and (C) at the end
of such four (4) Business Day period and taking into account any modifications
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in a written,
binding and irrevocable offer, the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that, in the
case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, such Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(e)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law,
(iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in
this Section 5.3 or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to the shareholders of the Company). No
disclosures under this Section 5.3(e) shall be, in themselves, a breach of
Section 5.3 or a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Article VII.



(f)As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
any of its Affiliates thereof) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, (a) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including securities of Subsidiaries) that account for 15% or more of the
Company's consolidated assets or from which 15% or more of the Company's
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are derived or (b) 15% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, sale or issuance of shares of capital stock,
tender offer, share exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving the Company, in each case other than the Merger.



(g)As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any unsolicited
written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors,
to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Transactions (as may be revised pursuant to Section 5.3(d) of this Agreement),
taking into account, to the extent applicable, the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement that the
Company Board considers relevant; provided that for purposes of the definition
of Superior Proposal, the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."



Section 5.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as practicable, (ii) make
promptly any required submissions and filings under applicable Antitrust Laws
or to Governmental Authorities with respect to the Transactions, (iii)
promptly furnish information required in connection with such submissions and
filing to such Governmental Authorities or under such Antitrust Laws, (iv)
keep the other parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any
such submissions and filings to such Governmental Authorities or under
Antitrust Laws and cooperate with each other, including with respect to: (A)
the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver,
(B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws
and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or
threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws with
respect to the Transactions and (v) obtain all actions or non-actions,
approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Person necessary to consummate the Transactions as soon
as practicable. For purposes hereof, "Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, all applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.



(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof (unless the parties
otherwise agree)), (B) supply as soon as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
(including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable and (ii) each party
agrees to (A) make or cause to be made the appropriate filings (including
notice filings) as soon as practicable (and in any event within twenty-one
(21) Business Days after the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree))
with the PSCU, PSCW and PUCI relating to the Merger, (B) supply as soon as practical
any additional information and documentary material that may be required or
requested by the PSCU, PSCW and PUCI and any other applicable Governmental
Authority and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all other actions consistent with this Section 5.4 as necessary to obtain any
necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other
actions or non-actions from the PSCU, PSCW and PUCI as soon as practicable.
Promptly after the date of this Agreement, at Parent's reasonable request, the
Company and Parent agree to meet and confer in good faith to discuss and
consider combining or consolidating any outstanding or planned rate cases with
respect to the Required Statutory Approvals and filings set forth in Section
5.4(b)(ii)(A).



(c)The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information: (i) promptly notify the other parties
hereto of (and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of) any
communication to such Person from a third person or any Governmental Authority
regarding the filings and submissions described in Section 5.4(a) and permit
the others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written response to
any communication from a Governmental Authority regarding the filings and
submissions described in Section 5.4(a), (ii) keep the others reasonably
informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the
Transactions and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or
discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without giving the other
party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate;
provided, that the parties shall be permitted to redact any correspondence,
filing, submission or communication to the extent such correspondence, filing,
submission or communication contains competitively or commercially sensitive
information, including information relating to the valuation of the
Transactions.

(d)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Section 5.4, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate
or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,
approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws that may
be required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties to
close the Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date), including committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i)
the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of assets or
businesses of Parent or Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii)
terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating any relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries (each a "Remedial Action"); provided,
however, that any Remedial Action may, at the discretion of the Company or
Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions.



(e)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Section 5.4, in the event that any
litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is reasonably foreseeable challenging any of the
Transactions and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to take any and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or
resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding as promptly as practicable
(and in any event shall commence such action no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the End Date). In addition, each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts to contest, defend and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any ruling, decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, delays, interferes with or restricts consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the End Date.



(f)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor Company shall, nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to,
acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval
or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws with respect to the
Transactions, or would reasonably be expected to materially prevent or
prohibit or impede, interfere with or delay obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other
applicable laws with respect to the Transactions.



(g)Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to, and, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent may be withheld at Parent's sole discretion) the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, in connection with
obtaining any consent or approval of any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, offer or accept,
or agree, commit to agree or consent to, any undertaking, term, condition,
liability, obligation, commitment or sanction (including any Remedial Action),
that constitutes a Burdensome Condition.

(h)Parent shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall notify
Parent of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
alleging that such Governmental Authority's consent is or may be required in
connection with or as a condition of the Merger.



Section 5.5 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and consultation
as is feasible); provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.5 shall not apply to any release or public statement (a) made or
proposed to be made by the Company in connection with a Takeover Proposal, a
Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action
taken pursuant thereto, (b) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the Transactions or (c) that is not inconsistent
in any material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.



Section 5.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a)Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (at Parent's sole
cost and expense) during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties and personnel (but
excluding for the conduct of Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments or
testing), books, Contracts and records and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning its business and
properties as Parent may reasonably request (other than any publicly available document filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws); provided that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the other party; provided, further, (x) that the Company
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party,
jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose such
party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information
and (y) the conduct of such activities shall be subject to the rights and
obligations of the Company referred to in the final proviso of the final
sentence of Section 5.4(c) hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide commercially reasonable
assistance to Dominion Midstream Partners (including the Conflicts Committee
of DMPGP) in connection with the preparation of financial statements that may
be required in connection with any proposed contribution of Questar Pipeline
or any of its assets to Dominion Midstream Partners. Until the Effective Time,
the information provided will be subject to the terms of the confidentiality
letter agreement, dated as of December 30, 2015, between Parent and the
Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Company shall not, and Parent and Company shall cause their respective
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions.



(b)If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be amended and
restated such that (i) the "Restricted Period" for all purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be the period of eighteen (18) months from the
date of such termination, as if the Parties had never entered into this
Agreement, and (ii) the other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in force and effect for a period of two (2) years after such
termination, as if the parties hereto had never entered into this Agreement.



Section 5.7 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the
Transactions, the Company and the Company Board will use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.



Section 5.8 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
and former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees")
against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties,
costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a "Claim"), whenever
asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission relating to their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries
occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of limitation of liability, exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses as provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and
the respective organizational documents of each of the Company's Subsidiaries
as currently in effect and (B) any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee listed on Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
which shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue in full force
and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions for limitation
of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no less favorable to the
Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter Documents in effect on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by applicable Law.



(b)From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Claim
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.8 or the
enforcement of an Indemnitee's rights under this Section 5.8 as and when
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification for such matter.



(c)For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect coverage not materially less favorable than the
coverage provided by the policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time either through the Company's existing
insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected by Parent;
provided, however, that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company in respect of the coverages required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; provided, further, that in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which Parent would be
required to spend during the six-year period provided for in this Section
5.8(c), that provides coverage not materially less favorable than the coverage
described above to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time.



(d)The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives from and after the Effective Time, and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.8 applies
unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.8).



(e)In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.8. 

Section 5.9 Transaction Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall
notify the other promptly of the commencement of any shareholder litigation
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions of which it has received notice
or which, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened ("Transaction
Litigation"). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and
no such settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by the
Company without Parent's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 5.10 Section 16. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps reasonably necessary to cause
any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) directly resulting from the Merger by each
individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.



Section 5.11 Employee Matters.



(a)Until the later of one (1) year following the Effective Time or December
31, 2017 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee") annual
base salary and base wages, target annual cash bonuses (subject to the
satisfaction of performance criteria determined by Parent, provided that such
performance criteria shall be no less favorable than for other similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries) and target long-term
incentive compensation opportunities (which shall be in a form and subject in
whole or in part to the satisfaction of performance criteria as determined by
Parent, provided that the form of such awards and the performance criteria
shall be no less favorable than for other similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries) and employee benefits (excluding any voluntary
elective deferral component of any nonqualified deferred compensation plan)
that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate than such annual
base salary and base wages, target annual cash bonuses and target long-term
incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits provided to the
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that annual cash bonus and any long-term incentive compensation opportunities
shall not be required to be provided for performance periods commencing before
January 1, 2017 and, if the Effective Time occurs in 2017, any annual cash
bonus opportunity may be pro-rated based on days of service during such
performance period on and after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide any Company Employee whose employment terminates under
circumstances entitling the Company Employee to severance under the applicable
Parent severance plan, program or arrangement (or any successor thereto)
(collectively, the "Parent Severance Programs") during the Continuation Period
(including, for avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee whose employment
terminates under such circumstances in an individual or one-off termination
and regardless of whether any other employee is affected) or, with respect to
the Company Employees identified on Section 5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, whose employment terminates for "Good Reason" (as defined in Section
5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and who signs a general release
of claims on a form satisfactory to Parent, with severance benefits no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries under the Parent Severance Programs, and, for the avoidance
of doubt, taking into account all of the Company Employee's service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) for purposes of
determining the levels of severance benefits to be provided to such Company
Employee under the Parent Severance Programs; provided, however, that no Company Employee who is covered by the Company Executive Severance
Compensation Plan or any other severance plan or arrangement with the Company
or its Subsidiaries that provides for more favorable severance payments and
benefits than the Parent Severance Program shall be eligible for coverage
under the Parent Severance Program.



(b)For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate
and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual)
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time (including the
Company Plans) (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service and, provided further, that no Company Employee shall be entitled
based on such prior credited service or otherwise to participate in any frozen
or grandfathered plan or benefit formula of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that would not be offered to employees first hired by Parent or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. Furthermore, to the extent a Company
Employee or a "Company Retired Employee" (as defined below) becomes eligible
to participate in Parent's or its Subsidiaries' retiree medical plan, for all
purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level
of benefits) under the retiree medical plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
each (x) Company Employee and (y) former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
ended as a result of such former employee's retirement and who is eligible to
participate in the Company's retiree medical plan as of the Effective Time
(the "Company Retired Employees"), shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee or Company Retired Employee was entitled, immediately before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under the Company's retiree medical
plan as of the Effective Time; provided that any individual who waived
participation in the Company's retiree medical plan but is still eligible,
pursuant to the terms of such retiree medical plan as in effect on the date
hereof, to participate in such plan, shall remain eligible to participate in
such plan but shall not be or become eligible to participate in any retiree
medical plan of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving
Corporation) and provided further that the parties agree to the matters set
forth on Section 5.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall, or
shall cause an Affiliate to, provide postretirement medical benefits to
Eligible Retirees (as defined below) that (i) during the Continuation Period
are no less favorable than those provided under the Company's postretirement
medical program in effect as of December 31, 2015 (the "Company Retiree Health
Plan") and (ii) following the Continuation Period are no less favorable than
either (1) those provided under the Company Retiree Health Plan or (2) those
provided to similarly situated, as applicable, employees and retirees who
participate in the post-retirement programs of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Surviving Corporation). "Eligible Retirees" means Company
Retired Employees and Company Employees who are or become eligible to
participate in the Company Retiree Health Plan as in effect on January 1,
2016. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.



(c)Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to assume and honor and continue all obligations under the
Company Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, and the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control," "change of control", "corporate transaction" or similar words to
such effect under such Company Plans, arrangements or agreements.



(d)To the extent that the Effective Time occurs (i) in 2016 or (ii) following
the end of the 2016 performance period with respect to the Company's Annual
Incentive Plans or any other applicable annual bonus plan, but, in each case,
prior to payment of the bonuses for such 2016 performance period, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee the greater of
(i) the Company Employee's target bonus for such 2016 performance period and
(ii) the bonus to which the Company Employee would be entitled for such 2016
performance period based on actual performance. In addition, in the event that
the Effective Time occurs in 2017, at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee a pro-rata portion
of any bonus that such Company Employee would have been entitled to receive
under the Company's Annual Incentive Plans and any other applicable annual
bonus plan for the 2017 performance period based on the Company Employee's
target bonus for such 2017 performance period.



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no provision of this Section 5.11 is intended to, or shall, constitute the
establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Company Plans or any
employee benefit plan of Parent, Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries, and no Company Employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof including in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment). Unless otherwise
specifically provided in this Section 5.11, no provision of this Agreement
shall constitute a limitation on Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or
their respective Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or terminate, after the
Effective Time, any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent,
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries. Nothing contained
herein shall alter the at-will employment relationship of any Company
Employee.



Section 5.12 Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)
cause Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not
engage in any activity of any nature except for activities related to or in
furtherance of the Transactions.



Section 5.13 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.



Section 5.14 Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration. Before the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE and SEC to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the
NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.



Section 5.15 Advice of Changes. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will, to the extent
not in violation of any applicable Law, promptly notify the other of (a) any
circumstance, development, change, event, occurrence or effect of which it has
Knowledge that has had or that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, or (b) any material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to a failure of any condition to the obligations of the other party
to effect the Merger set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, provided that
(i) no such notification will affect the representations, warranties or
covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall the failure to comply with
this Section 5.15 give rise to a failure of any condition set forth in Article
VI to be satisfied.



Section 5.16 Financing Cooperation



(a)The Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to, (i)
provide commercially reasonable assistance with the preparation of and any
discussions regarding the business, financial statements, and management
discussion and analysis of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company,
all for use in connection with any debt or equity financing to be obtained by
Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent, including any registration statement
filed with the SEC in anticipation thereof (the "Financing", which term shall
include, without limitation, the Transaction Financing) where Parent
determines that the inclusion of such information is required or desirable,
and (ii) request that its independent accountants provide customary and
reasonable assistance to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, in
connection with providing customary comfort letters in connection with the
Financing; provided, further, that nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company to cause the delivery of (A) legal opinions or reliance letters or any
certificate as to solvency or any other certificate necessary for the
Financing, other than as allowed by the preceding clause (ii), (B) any audited
financial information or any financial information prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X under the Securities Act or any financial
information in a form not customarily prepared by the Company with respect to
any period or (C) any financial information with respect to a month or fiscal
period that has not yet ended or has ended less than forty-five (45) days
prior to the date of such request.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 5.16): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 5.16) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it would
(A) require the Company to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse any
expenses or otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities prior to
the Closing, (B) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, (C)
require the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to enter into or
approve any agreement or other documentation effective prior to the Closing or
agree to any change or modification of any existing agreement or other documentation that would be effective prior to the Closing,
(D) require the Company to provide pro forma financial statements or pro forma
adjustments reflecting the Financing or any description of all or any
component of the Financing (it being understood that the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to assist in preparation of pro forma financial
adjustments to the extent otherwise relating to the Company and required by
the Financing), (E) require the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to
provide pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments reflecting
transactions contemplated or required hereunder (it being understood that the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to assist in preparation of pro
forma financial adjustments to the extent otherwise relating to the Company
and required by the Financing), or (F) require the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective boards of directors (or
equivalent bodies) to approve or authorize the Financing, and (ii) no action,
liability or obligation (including any obligation to pay any commitment or
other fees or reimburse any expenses) of the Company, the Subsidiaries of the
Company or any of their respective Representatives under any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Financing shall
be effective until the Closing.



(c)Parent shall (i) promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and out-
of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable and documented costs and
expenses of counsel and accountants) incurred by the Company, the Subsidiaries
of the Company and any of its or their Representatives in connection with any
cooperation provided for in this Section 5.16 and (ii) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of its and their
Representatives against any claim, loss, damage, injury, liability, judgment,
award, penalty, fine, Tax, cost (including cost of investigation), expense
(including fees and expenses of counsel and accountants) or settlement payment
incurred as a result of, or in connection with, any cooperation provided for
in this Section 5.16 or the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, unless the Company acted in bad faith or with gross negligence and
other than in the case of fraud.



(d)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly following
Parent's request, the Company shall deliver to each of the lenders under the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' existing short and long-term Indebtedness (the
"Existing Loan Lenders") a notice (an "Existing Loan Notice") prepared by
Parent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, notifying
each of the Existing Loan Lenders of this Agreement and the contemplated
Merger. At Parent's election, the Existing Loan Notice with respect to one or
more of the Existing Loan Documents may include a request for a consent, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company (an "Existing Loan
Consent"), to (1) the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (2) certain modifications of (or waivers
under or other changes to) the Existing Loan Documents; provided, that no such

ARTICLE VII



TERMINATION



Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:



(a)by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or



(b)by either of the Company or Parent:



(i)if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before February 28,
2017 (the "End Date"); provided that if, prior to the End Date, all of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or
waived, as applicable, or shall then be capable of being satisfied (except for
any condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c) or Section
6.2(e)), either the Company or Parent may, prior to 5:00 p.m. Salt Lake City,
Utah time on the End Date, extend the End Date to a date that is not later
than six (6) months after the End Date (the "Initial Extension Period");
provided, further, that if, prior to the 5:00 p.m., Salt Lake City, Utah time
on the date that is the last day of the Initial Extension Period, all of the

extended, such later date shall then, for all purposes under this Agreement,
be the "End Date"); provided, further, that neither the Company nor Parent may
terminate this Agreement or extend the End Date pursuant to this Section
7.1(b)(i) if it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is in breach of this
Agreement and such breach has primarily caused or resulted in either (1) the
failure to satisfy the conditions to its obligations to consummate the Closing
set forth in Article VI prior to the End Date or (2) the failure of the
Closing to have occurred prior to the End Date;



(ii)if any Law having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall not have

in full force and effect and, in the case of any ruling, decree, judgment,
injunction or order of any Governmental Authority (each, a "Restraint"), shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to a breach by such party of any of its covenants
or agreements under this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 5.4:



(iii)if the Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall
not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof); or



(c)by Parent:



(i)if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if it or Merger
Sub is then in material breach of this Agreement; or



(ii)if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(c)(ii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained; or



(d)by the Company:



(i)if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b),
respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company stating the
Company's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(d)(i) and the basis for such termination; provided that, Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i)
if it is then in material breach of this Agreement; or



(ii)prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company
Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect
to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.3 and shall have approved,
and concurrently with the termination hereunder, the Company shall have
entered into, a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided that such termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii)
shall not be effective and the Company shall not enter into any such Company
Acquisition Agreement, unless the Company has paid the Company Termination Fee
to Parent or causes the Company Termination Fee to be paid to Parent
substantially concurrently with such termination in accordance with Section
7.3; (provided that Parent shall have provided wiring instructions for such
payment or, if not, then such payment shall be paid promptly following
delivery of such instructions).

 Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and have no further force or effect (other than Section 5.6(b), Section
7.2 and Section 7.3, and Article VIII, all of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers, other
Representatives or Affiliates, whether arising before or after such
termination, based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity); provided, however, that, subject to Section 7.3
(including the limitations on liability contained therein), no party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any
willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination that
gave rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VI or as set
forth in the last sentence of this Section 7.2. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive in accordance with its terms following termination of this
Agreement. Without limiting the meaning of a willful and material breach, the
parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by a party hereto to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the
time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall constitute a willful and
material breach of this Agreement.



Section 7.3 Company Termination Fee.

Section 7.1(d)(ii), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid as directed by
Parent the Company Termination Fee substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement.

Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) or (B) by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) (solely with respect to a breach or failure to
perform a covenant), (ii) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or made to the Company after the date hereof and not publicly
withdrawn (x) in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or
Section 7.1(c)(i), prior to the date of such termination, or (y) in the case
of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), prior to the date of the
Company Shareholder Meeting, and (iii) within twelve (12) months of the date
this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement or consummates a Takeover Proposal (provided that for purposes of
clause (iii) of this Section 7.3(c), the references to "15%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid as directed by Parent the Company
Termination Fee on the earlier of the date of entry into a Company Acquisition
Agreement or consummation of such transaction and such amount, if any, paid
pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) shall be reduced by the amount paid, if any,
pursuant to Section 7.3(e).



(d)For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Termination Fee" shall mean an
amount equal to $99,000,000.



(e)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid as directed by Parent, the reasonable costs, fees and expenses incurred by Parent, its Affiliates and their Representatives
in connection with the investigation, due diligence, documentation and
negotiation of this Agreement, such amount not to exceed $5,000,000. In the
event the foregoing payment is paid and a Company Termination Fee is
thereafter payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c), the Company Termination Fee
otherwise payable shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.



(f) Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to $154,000,000 (the
"Parent Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated:



(A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) and, at the time of
such termination, (1) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(e) has not been
satisfied with respect to one or more Regulatory Approvals, (2) any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c) have not been
satisfied, provided that such failure to be satisfied relates solely to a
Regulatory Approval as to which the condition set forth in Section 6.2(e) has
not been satisfied, and (3) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a)
and Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b) and 6.2(d) shall have been satisfied; or

(B) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) and, at the time
of such termination, (1) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(e) has not
been satisfied with respect to one or more Regulatory Approvals, (2) the
applicable Restraint giving rise to such termination relates solely to a
Regulatory Approval as to which the condition set forth in Section 6.2(e) has
not been satisfied, and (3) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a)
and Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b) and 6.2(d) shall have been satisfied; or

such breach has primarily caused the failure of any Regulatory Approval to be
obtained) and, at the time of such termination, all of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(a), Section 6.1(c) (except any failure of the condition
set forth in Section 6.1(c) to be satisfied primarily caused by a material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under Section 5.4 that has
primarily caused the failure of any Regulatory Approval to be obtained) and
Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b) and 6.2(d) shall have been satisfied.

Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company (to an account
designated in writing by the Company) no later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of the applicable termination.

(g)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated
to pay the Company Termination Fee under this Section 7.3 and the Company
Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions, and, upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company (and the Company's
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
shareholders and other Representatives) shall have no further liability with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent
is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee under this Section 7.3 and the

Affiliates or Representatives.

holders brought an action against Parent and Merger Sub and were recognized as
intended third party beneficiaries hereunder, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, (iii) the provisions of

(a)This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict

obligations of the Company Board and matters that are specifically required by
the URBCA in connection with the Transactions shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Utah.



(b)Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken

to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) agrees
that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(provided that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in or
declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims shall be brought,
heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iv) agrees not to bring

not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party
by any other legally available method.

arising out of or relating to the Transaction Financing or the performance

Source (in its capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and
no Financing Source will have any rights or claims against the Company or any
of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or in equity, in contract tort or otherwise, and in addition,
in no event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential, special,
exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits,
business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature, except to
the extent paid in connection with a claim by a third party. The parties
hereto further agree that all of the provisions of Section 8.10 relating to
waiver of jury trial shall also apply to any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third party-claim referenced in this paragraph.



Section 8.9 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that immediate, extensive
and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party seeking to
enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement
shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate
injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this
being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. If any party hereto brings any Claim to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date
shall automatically be extended by the period of time between the commencement
of such Claim and ten (10) Business Days following the date on which such
Claim is fully and finally resolved.

EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
