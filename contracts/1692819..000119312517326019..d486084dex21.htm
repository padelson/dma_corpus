ARTICLE II

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Rockets shall be merged with and into Mavericks,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Rockets shall cease, and
Mavericks shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware Law as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 2.2 _Closing_. The Parties shall consummate the Merger (such
consummation, the " _Closing_ ") at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 at 9:00 a.m., Dallas,
Texas time, on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is

 



17  the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
(other than any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied by action
taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Parties may agree in
writing.

 

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Mavericks shall file
a certificate of merger in respect of the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is
required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed between the Parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be
as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Rockets shall vest in Mavericks (as the Surviving Corporation), and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Rockets shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of Mavericks (as the Surviving Corporation), all as provided under
the DGCL.

 

Section 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation_. Mavericks certificate of incorporation and bylaws
shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Mavericks (as the
Surviving Corporation) until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Law.

Section 2.6 _Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Mavericks Board
shall take all necessary actions so that, immediately following the Effective
Time, the size of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation Board_ ") shall be increased from eight (8) to eleven
(11) directors. Prior to the Closing, Mavericks shall take all actions
necessary so that, effective as of the Effective Time, three (3) directors
serving on the Rockets Board immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Rockets Directors_ ") shall be appointed as members of the Surviving
Corporation Board to fill the vacancies created by the action described in the
first sentence of this _Section 2.6_; _provided_ that the Rockets Directors
are willing to serve and will satisfy applicable NYSE independence
requirements and FERC interlocking directorship requirements and taking into
account Mavericks Corporate Governance Guidelines (with the Mavericks Board
and its nominating and governance committee acting reasonably and in good
faith); _provided_ , _further_ , that in accordance with Section 5.2 of the
Mavericks certificate of incorporation as amended through the date
hereof, (i) if the Effective Time is on or prior to the date of the
Mavericks 2018 Annual General Meeting, one (1) Rockets Director will be
appointed a Class I director, one (1) Rockets Director will be appointed a
Class II director and one (1) Rockets Director will be appointed a Class III
director, and (ii) if the Effective Time is after the date of the Mavericks
2018 Annual General Meeting, one (1) Rockets Director will be appointed
a Class I director and two (2) Rockets Directors will be appointed Class II
directors.

 

Section 2.7 _Certain Officers_. The individuals set forth on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto shall be the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief
Operating Officer and the Chief

 



18  Financial Officer of Mavericks (as the Surviving Corporation) immediately
following the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Rockets or the
holders of any securities of Rockets:

 

(a) _Conversion of Rockets Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.1(b)_ and
_Section 3.1(c)_, each share of common stock of Rockets, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Rockets Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, excluding any Cancelled Shares (each such share,
excluding any Cancelled Shares, an " _Eligible Share_ "), shall, at the
Effective Time, automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.652
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Mavericks Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities
of Rockets, (i) all of the Eligible Shares converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, in each case, as of
the Effective Time, and (b) the holders of Eligible Shares not represented by
Certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of Eligible Shares
represented by certificates (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except (i) the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates and (ii) the right, if any, to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of Rockets Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is (i) owned by
Mavericks or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Mavericks, (ii) held in treasury
by Rockets or (iii) owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Rockets (all such
shares of Rockets Common Stock, other than shares of Rockets Common Stock
held on behalf of Third Parties, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any Person, be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange for such cancellation.

(c) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each former holder of Eligible Shares otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Mavericks Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock issuable to such former
holder) will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 3.1(c)_, a cash payment in lieu of such
fractional share of Mavericks Common Stock representing such former holders
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in
one or more transactions of shares of

 



19  Mavericks Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Mavericks Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Mavericks pursuant to  _Section 3.2(a)_ over (B) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Mavericks Common Stock to be distributed to the former holders
of Eligible Shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ (such excess, the "
_Excess Shares_ "). The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock
was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Mavericks that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares of Mavericks Common Stock. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of
Eligible Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Mavericks
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices on
the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in
_Section 3.1(c)(ii)_.

(ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
former holders of Eligible Shares that would otherwise receive fractional
shares of Mavericks Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or
more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the former holders of Eligible Shares, the Exchange Agent shall
hold such proceeds in trust for the former holders of Eligible Shares that
would otherwise receive fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock (the "
_Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of
the Common Shares Trust to which each former holder of Eligible Shares shall
be entitled, if any, by multiplying (A) the amount of the aggregate proceeds
comprising the Common Shares Trust by (B) a fraction, (1) the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former
holder of Eligible Shares would otherwise be entitled and (2) the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
former holders of Eligible Shares would otherwise be entitled.

 

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Eligible Shares in lieu of any fractional
shares of Mavericks Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such holders of shares of Mavericks Common Stock without interest,
subject to and in accordance with _Section 3.2_. 

(d) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period
between the date hereof and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Mavericks or Rockets (or any other securities
convertible therefor or exchangeable thereto) occurs as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period (in each case, other
than a conversion pursuant to the Certificate of Designation (as in effect on
the date of this Agreement) of the Rockets 5.375% Preferred Stock), the
Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Mavericks and the holders of
Eligible Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the
Exchange Ratio shall be references to the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 3.1(d)_ shall be
deemed to permit or authorize any Party to effect any such change that it is
not otherwise

 



20  authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the issuance or distribution of Escrow Shares shall not
give rise to any adjustment under the terms of this _Section 3.1(d)_.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Rockets shall appoint
an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Mavericks (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the purpose of exchanging Eligible Shares for the Merger Consideration.
Prior to the Effective Time, Mavericks shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
the Eligible Shares, a number of shares of Mavericks Common Stock in book-
entry form equal to the number of shares of Mavericks Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. Following the Effective Time, Mavericks agrees
to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_. All such book-entries representing shares of Mavericks Common Stock
(including the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
3.1(c)_ ) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
following the Closing Date, Mavericks shall cause the Exchange Agent to
transmit (or mail in the case of Eligible Shares represented by
a Certificate) to each former holder of Eligible Shares, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that
risk of loss and title to the Eligible Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Eligible Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Rockets and Mavericks) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Eligible Shares in
exchange for (A) whole shares of Mavericks Common Stock, (B) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
and (C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
former record holder of a Book-Entry Share shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In
lieu thereof, such former record holder shall upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if
any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive,
and Mavericks shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Book-Entry Share of such former holder, and such Book-
Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. Upon surrender of Eligible Shares
for cancellation and exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the former holder of such Eligible Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of
Mavericks Common Stock (after taking into account all Eligible Shares
surrendered by such former holder) to which such former holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (which shall be in uncertificated, book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested), payment by check in lieu of
fractional shares of Mavericks Common Stock which such former holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, 

 



21  and the Eligible Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Eligible Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration
thereof that the surrendered Eligible Share be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in
the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Eligible Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.2(b)_, each Eligible Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section 3.2(c)_) upon
such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section 3.2(c)_.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Mavericks Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the former holder of any
unsurrendered Eligible Shares with respect to the shares of Mavericks Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
of Mavericks Common Stock shall be paid to any such former holder pursuant to
_Section 3.1(c)_, until such Eligible Share has been surrendered in
accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Eligible Share, there shall be paid to the former record
holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
number of whole shares of Mavericks Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor pursuant to this _Article III_ , together with any cash payable in
lieu of any fractional share of Mavericks Common Stock to which such former
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Mavericks Common Stock
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date (if any), the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Mavericks Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Rockets Common Stock; Closing of
Transfer Books_. All shares of Mavericks Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section
3.2(c)_ shall be deemed to have been issued or paid, respectively, in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Eligible Shares. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Rockets shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Eligible Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Eligible Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article III_.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Eligible Shares for one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Mavericks upon demand, and, after such time, any
former holders of Eligible Shares who have not then complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Mavericks for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Mavericks Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_.

 



22 (f) _No Liability_. Any amounts under this Agreement that would
be otherwise payable to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law shall, immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, such
public official, become, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, property of
Mavericks or an Affiliate of Mavericks designated by Mavericks, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary none of Rockets,
Mavericks (including as the Surviving Corporation), the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Eligible Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. The Exchange Agent, Rockets and Mavericks
(including as the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
Persons, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
formerly representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by
Mavericks, the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Mavericks
may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent or Mavericks on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article
III_.

 

Section 3.3 _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Rockets Common
Stock in connection with the Merger or otherwise under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ROCKETS

 

Except (1) as disclosed in (A) any Rockets SEC Documents filed with or
furnished to the SEC at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" or "forward-looking
statements" section or any other disclosures that are forward-looking,
predictive or cautionary in nature) where the relevance of the information as
an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is

prohibit Mavericks from publicly disclosing the receipt of a Mavericks
Acquisition Proposal, and such public disclosure shall not be a Mavericks
Change of Recommendation; _provided_ that such public disclosure includes only
factual statements and reaffirms the Mavericks Recommendation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Mavericks Board may, at any time prior to receipt of the Mavericks

a Mavericks Change of Recommendation) or authorize Mavericks to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_, if (but only if):

 

(i) a bona fide Mavericks Acquisition Proposal is received by Mavericks or
its directors, officers, employees or Representatives from a Third Party
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement which did not result from,

inconsistent with the exercise of the Mavericks Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

(iv) Mavericks provides Rockets with written notice stating that

sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC with

any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of any material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party in writing
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,

Mavericks, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Stock
Issuance (the " _Mavericks Stockholders Meeting_ ") and, in the case of
Rockets, the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Rockets Stockholders Meeting_

its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Mavericks
Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Stock Issuance and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to obtain the Mavericks Stockholder Approval. Unless the Rockets

 



80  Board has made a Rockets Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.5(e)_ or _Section 6.5(f)_, Rockets will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from the Rockets Stockholders proxies in favor

Stockholders Meeting even if a Rockets Change of Recommendation shall have

Mavericks Stockholders at the Mavericks Stockholders Meeting even if a
Mavericks Change of Recommendation shall have occurred; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not restrict the Parties respective rights under _Section
8.1(j)_ or _Section 8.1(k)_.

 

(e) Each of Mavericks and Rockets will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to hold the Mavericks Stockholders Meeting and the Rockets
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, on the same date and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement but subject to the DGCL, Mavericks obligation to
give notice of, convene and hold the Mavericks Stockholders Meeting and
Rockets obligation to give notice of, convene and hold the Rockets
Stockholders Meeting, shall not be limited, or otherwise affected, by the

Mavericks Change of Recommendation or Rockets Change of Recommendation. Except
(i) as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable Partys
Organizational Documents and (ii) to the extent required by applicable Law, in
connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted by _Section 6.6(f)_,
neither Mavericks nor Rockets shall change the record date for the Mavericks
Stockholders Meeting or the Rockets Stockholders Meeting, respectively, after
it has been set in accordance with _Section 6.6(d)_, without the prior
written consent of the other Party. In addition, without the prior written
consent of the other Party, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Stock Issuance shall be the only proposals to be voted on at Mavericks
Stockholders Meeting, and the adoption of this Agreement and an advisory vote
on compensation payable to executive officers of Rockets in connection with
the Merger shall be the only proposals to be voted on at the Rockets
Stockholders Meeting.

 

(f) Mavericks shall not postpone, delay or adjourn the Mavericks
Stockholders Meeting after the date thereof has been publicly announced, and
Rockets shall not postpone, delay or adjourn the Rockets Stockholders Meeting

Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Rockets Common Stock (each, a "
_Rockets Stock Option_ ") granted under the Rockets Stock Plans, whether

Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio and remain outstanding on the same terms and
conditions as are applicable to such awards prior to the Effective Time.

 



82 (iii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of Rockets PSUs

any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive from Mavericks, at the Effective Time, a number of shares of
Mavericks Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid by
the Surviving Corporation to the holder) equal to the product of (A) the total
number of shares of Rockets Common Stock that would be payable in respect of
such Rockets PSU (1) in the case of Rockets PSUs granted in 2015, at the
actual level of performance applicable to such Rockets PSU as determined in
accordance with the applicable award agreement pursuant to which such Rockets
PSU was granted, (2) in the case of Rockets PSUs with respect to which the
Effective Time occurs after the first twelve (12) months of the applicable
performance period (other than Rockets PSUs granted in 2015), (x) at the

Rockets PSU that relates to free cash flow, and (3) in the case of Rockets

that relates to free cash flow, and (B) the Exchange Ratio.

 

(iv) Each phantom stock unit (a " _Rockets Phantom Stock Unit_ ") granted
under the phantom stock plan of Rockets that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
phantom stock units relating to that number of shares of Mavericks Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) one share of Rockets Common Stock and (B)
the Exchange Ratio on the same terms and conditions (except as provided in
this _Section 6.7(a)(iv)_) as were applicable under such Rockets Phantom
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(v) As of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the
part of the applicable participant, the number of hypothetical shares of
Rockets Common Stock credited to the Company Deferral Account (as defined in
the Rockets Deferred Compensation Plan) of each participant in the Rockets
Deferred Compensation Plan which Company Deferral Account has an outstanding
balance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
that number of hypothetical shares of Mavericks Common Stock equal to the
product of (A) the total number of hypothetical shares of Rockets Common
Stock credited to such Company Deferral Account immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, on the same terms and conditions
(except as provided in this  _Section 6.7(a)(v)_) as were applicable to such
Company Deferral Account immediately prior to the Effective Time.

take such other actions as required to effect the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.7(a)_.

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Mavericks shall honor all Mavericks
Benefit Plans and Rockets Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and
agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit Mavericks from
amending or terminating any such Mavericks Benefit Plans, Rockets Benefit
Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or from
terminating the employment of any Mavericks Employee or any Rockets Employee
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, the Mavericks Benefit Plans and the
Rockets Benefit Plans in effect as of the date hereof and at the Effective
Time shall remain in effect with respect to employees and former employees of
Mavericks or Rockets and their respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Combined Employees_ "), respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective
Time, until such time as Mavericks (as the Surviving Corporation) shall
otherwise determine, subject to applicable Law and the terms of such plans. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time and consistent with any
obligations arising under any collective bargaining agreement or similar
contract, the Parties shall take all actions necessary to transition the
Rockets Employees participation in the Rockets Benefit Plans to the Mavericks
Benefit Plans, and, at the effective time of such transition, such Rockets
Employees shall cease to accrue any additional benefits under the applicable
Rockets Benefit Plans. It is the intention of Rockets and Mavericks, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, to (A) complete such transition to
Mavericks Benefit Plans on a comparable basis in respect of Mavericks
Employees and Rockets Employees as soon as administratively practicable after
the Effective Time, and (B) provide to similarly situated Mavericks Employees
and Rockets Employees following the Effective Time base salaries and wage
rates and cash bonus opportunities on a comparable basis, in the case of both
clauses (A) and (B) above, taking into account all relevant factors,
including duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities.

(iii) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of _Section 6.7(b)(ii)_,
except as otherwise provided under any collective bargaining agreement or
similar contract or Rockets Benefit Plan, Mavericks shall provide each Rockets
Employee with cash severance benefits in an amount, and otherwise on terms,
no less favorable than the amount and terms in effect immediately before the
Effective Time under the Rockets Severance Plan to the extent the Rockets
Employee participated therein immediately before the Effective Time, in each
case, for a period of no less than the longer of (A) twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date and (B) the period following the Closing Date as set forth in
the definition of "CIC Protection Period" in the Rockets Severance Plan for
the applicable participant level thereunder that such Rockets Employee
constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iv) With respect to any Mavericks Benefit Plans or new Benefit Plan in
which any Rockets Employees first become eligible to participate at or after
the Effective Time, (the " _New Plans_ "), Mavericks shall (or cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, as applicable) use commercially reasonable efforts
to: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Rockets
Employees under any New Plans that are health benefit plans in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,

 



84  exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Rockets
Benefit Plan; (B) in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, provide
each Rockets Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Rockets
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Rockets Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time;
and (C) recognize all service of Rockets Employees with Rockets and its
Affiliates, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
entitlement to benefits, and benefit accrual in any New Plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time with respect
to severance and vacation, to the extent such service is taken into account
under the applicable New Plan and to the extent such service was granted
under the analogous Rockets Benefit Plan; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits. On and
after the Effective Time, Mavericks shall continue in full force and effect
pursuant to their terms all agreements set forth in _Section 5.15(a)(i)_ of
the Mavericks Disclosure Schedule and any similar agreements entered into
consistent with _Section 6.1_, as such agreements may be amended from time to
time in accordance with their terms.

(v) (A) Prior to the Effective Time, Rockets shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each of its Subsidiaries that is a party to a
collective bargaining agreement set forth on _Section 6.7(b)(v)_ of the
Rockets Disclosure Schedule to extend the term of such collective bargaining
agreements for a period of one (1) year from the current expiration stated in
each collective bargaining agreement on the current terms and conditions of
such agreements (including any non-substantive administrative or technical
changes or modifications); _provided_ , that under no circumstances shall
receipt of an extension of the term of such collective bargaining agreements
be a condition to the Closing of the Merger. Rockets shall consult with
Mavericks in advance of and, to the extent practicable, during the course of
negotiations with any labor union as to the terms of any such extension, and
shall keep Mavericks reasonably informed regarding all material aspects of the
negotiations, consider any recommendations, advice or other input of
Mavericks with respect to such negotiations in good faith, and give Mavericks
reasonable notice of the time and location of any material negotiating
sessions concerning any such extension. (B) From and after the Effective
Time, Mavericks shall cause each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation that
is party to a collective bargaining agreement of Rockets or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect as of the Closing Date to honor the terms thereof until
such agreement otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the
parties thereto.

(vi) No later than the earlier of (A) April 15, 2018 and (B) the Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, Mavericks shall notify Rockets, in respect of
each Rockets Employee who as of the date of such notification is primarily
employed in the Houston, Texas, Cincinnati, Ohio, Collinsville, Illinois or
Springfield, Illinois metropolitan areas in a corporate rather than
operational or other field position, whether the employment of such Rockets
Employee is expected to continue after the Closing, the expected duration of
such continuation and the expected role and office location of such Rockets
Employee.

 



85 (vii) Nothing contained in this Section 6.7(b) or any other provision of
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Combined
Employee (or any other current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor) any right to continued employment for any period or
continued receipt of any specific benefit or compensation, or shall
constitute the establishment of or amendment to or any other modification of
any New Plan, Mavericks Benefit Plan or Rockets Benefit Plan or shall limit
the right of Mavericks or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or
terminate any New Plan, Mavericks Benefit Plan or Rockets Benefit Plan.
Further, this _Section 6.7_ shall be binding on and shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Parties, and nothing in this  _Section 6.7_, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including any Combined
Employee) any rights or remedies of any nature (including any third-party
beneficiary rights under this Agreement) whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 6.7_.

(c) Mavericks hereby acknowledges that the Closing shall constitute
a "change in control" (or similar term) of Rockets under the terms of the
Rockets Benefit Plans, as applicable.

individuals serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity
if such service was at the request or for the benefit of Rockets). Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether any Indemnified

directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies
currently maintained by Rockets, including any existing directors and
officers liability or fiduciary liability run off programs, for Claims
arising out of acts or conduct occurring on or before the Effective Time and
effective for Claims asserted prior to or during the six (6) year period

event shall Rockets or Mavericks expend for any year of such six-year period
an amount in excess of 300% of the annual aggregate premium paid by Rockets
for such insurance policies (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), which amount is set
forth in _Section 6.11(b)_ of the Rockets Disclosure Schedule. If such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Rockets or Mavericks, as the
case may be, will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to

incurred as a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or
fraud by or of Rockets or its Subsidiaries or their respective

to _Section 7.3(e)_, shall deliver the relevant opinion in such Sections. In
the event that Mavericks Counsel or Rockets Counsel is unwilling or unable
to provide the relevant opinion with the requisite degree of certainty
required under _Article VII_ , Mavericks or Rockets, as the case may be, shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion with the requisite level of
certainty from another nationally recognized counsel or a Big Four accounting
firm (in each case, reasonably satisfactory to Mavericks or Rockets, as the
case may be) as its alternative tax advisor. Each of Mavericks and Rockets
shall cooperate fully with the alternative tax advisor, including by
providing the necessary representation letters and other materials reasonably
requested by the alternative tax advisor. In the event that the alternative
tax advisor is unwilling or unable to deliver the required opinion with the
requisite level of certainty, and Mavericks or Rockets, as the case may be,
have used reasonable best efforts to obtain such opinion from the alternative
tax advisor, then the applicable party shall not be required to select any
other alternative tax advisor.

(collectively, the " _2026 Exchange_ ") and (ii) on Form S-3 or similar form
as required pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement (a " _Rockets Shelf_
"); _provided_ that such cooperation shall not be required to the extent it
would (i) unreasonably disrupt the ordinary conduct of the business or
operations of Mavericks or its Subsidiaries, (ii) require Mavericks or its
Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise
incur any actual or potential liability or give any indemnities prior to the

indemnify Mavericks or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise agrees to do so, (iii) require Mavericks or its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would reasonably be expected, in the reasonable judgment
of Mavericks after consultation with its legal counsel, to conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any applicable (A) Laws or Orders
binding on Mavericks or its Subsidiaries or (B) obligations of confidentiality
(not created in contemplation hereof) binding on Mavericks or its
Subsidiaries (provided that in the event that Mavericks or its Subsidiaries do

Mavericks and its Subsidiaries shall provide notice to Rockets promptly that
such information is being withheld (but solely if providing such notice would
not violate such obligation of confidentiality)) or (iv) require Mavericks or

Rockets Shelf that is not contingent on the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time or (B) provide or cause its legal
counsel to provide any legal opinions that are not required in connection with
the 2026 Exchange or Rockets Shelf.

 

(b) Rockets shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Mavericks, its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, Claims and reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of outside
legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts, consultants and other
advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with any action taken in
accordance with this _Section 6.23_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information related to Mavericks and its
Subsidiaries provided in writing by Mavericks or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this  _Section 6.23_), in any case, except to the extent
suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct,
bad faith or fraud by or of Mavericks or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives. In addition, Rockets shall, promptly upon written request by
Mavericks, reimburse Mavericks for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of outside legal
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts, consultants and other
advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) incurred by
Mavericks or its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of
Mavericks obligations under this _Section 6.23_.

Section 6.24 _Pre-Closing Asset Sales_. The Parties agree to engage an
independent third-party appraisal firm or valuation expert, mutually agreeable
to the Parties, to determine the fair market value for each of the Specified
Assets, such determination to be made within ninety (90) days of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Specified Asset Purchase Prices_ "). If, after such
determination, and no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date,
Mavericks delivers written notice to Rockets that Mavericks indirectly
wholly-owned subsidiary, Mavericks Development Company LLC, would like to
purchase any or all of the Specified Assets for cash consideration equal
to their Specified Asset Purchase Price, the Parties shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate (and shall cause
their Subsidiaries to cooperate) in good faith to consummate such purchase and
sale immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, including by executing a customary bill of sale, purchase agreement or
other conveyancing document as appropriate (including a purchase and sale
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances will Rockets be required
to consummate any such purchase or sale if such purchase or sale would
reasonably be expected to delay, hinder, restrict or prevent the receipt of
any Requisite Regulatory Approval or the Effective Time or would violate, in
any material respect, any contract or agreement binding on Rockets or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Parties intend to structure any such purchase and sale
as a conveyance of one or more limited liability companies holding the
Specified Assets, unless the Parties otherwise conclude that a conveyance of
Specified Assets directly is feasible and appropriate. The consummation of any
such purchase and sale shall not be a condition to Mavericks obligation to
effect the Merger.

termination of this Agreement contemplated by clause (i) above, Mavericks
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates any

_provided_ that for purposes of clause (iii) of this _Section 8.3(c)_, the

costs) incurred by Rockets and/or its Subsidiaries in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether incurred before or
after the date of this Agreement, including reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with its investigation,
structuring, financing, negotiation, due diligence, and financial, operating,
legal and other analysis in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the maximum aggregate amount
of fees and expenses for which Mavericks shall be required to reimburse
Rockets for under this  _Section 8.3(f)_ shall not exceed $22,000,000 (the "
_Mavericks Expense Reimbursement_ "), and in no event shall Mavericks be
required to make any Mavericks Expense Reimbursement if it has paid the
Mavericks No-Shop Termination Fee to Rockets in full. Mavericks shall pay or
cause to be paid the Mavericks Expense Reimbursement to Rockets by wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to the Rockets
Wiring Instructions no later than the fifth Business Day following receipt
from Rockets of request therefor accompanied by (to the extent practicable)
documentation with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to
_Section 8.2_, payment of the Mavericks Expense Reimbursement shall not be
the sole remedy of Rockets against Mavericks.

(g) If this Agreement is terminated by Rockets or Mavericks pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ other than a deemed termination under _Section 8.1(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(l)_, then Rockets shall pay to Mavericks the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and

expenses for which Rockets shall be required to reimburse Mavericks for under
this _Section 8.3(g)_ shall not exceed

 



102  $22,000,000 (the " _Rockets Expense Reimbursement_ "), and in no event shall
Rockets be required to make any Rockets Expense Reimbursement if it has paid
the Rockets Termination Fee to Mavericks in full. Rockets shall pay or cause
to be paid the Rockets Expense Reimbursement to Mavericks by wire transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to the Mavericks Wiring Instructions no
later than the fifth Business Day following receipt from Mavericks of request
therefor accompanied by (to the extent practicable) documentation with respect
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 8.2_, payment of the
Rockets Expense Reimbursement shall not be the sole remedy of Mavericks
against Rockets.

(h) Subject to the Parties right to specifically enforce the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.5_ prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Rockets agrees that (i) except in the case of a willful
and material breach of this Agreement by Mavericks, its right to receive the
payment of the Mavericks Termination Fees, as and when set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_, and its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and interest pursuant to _Section 6.19(d)_, _Section 8.3(f)_ and
_Section 8.3(j)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Rockets against
Mavericks, any of Mavericks Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future Representatives, stockholders, general or limited partners,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Mavericks Related Parties_ ") for all losses
and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for any other breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) none of the Mavericks
Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation, in any such case
(clause (i) or (ii) above) relating to, arising out of or with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
relating to, arising out of or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis
for such termination or otherwise). Without limitation of the foregoing, none
of Rockets, Rockets Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Claim against, or seek
damages from, any of the Mavericks Related Parties in contravention of the
preceding sentence. Under no circumstances shall Rockets be entitled to
receive more than one (1) Mavericks Termination Fee.

 

(i) Subject to the Parties right to specifically enforce the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.5_ prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Mavericks agrees that (i) except in the case of a willful and
material breach of this Agreement by Rockets, its right to receive the
payment of the Rockets Termination Fees, as and when set forth in _Section
8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(d)_, and its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and interest pursuant to _Section 6.23(b)_, _Section 8.3(g)_ and
_Section 8.3(j)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Rockets against
Mavericks, any of Rockets Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future Representatives, stockholders, general or limited partners,
members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Rockets Related Parties_ ") for all losses
and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for any other breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) none of the Rockets
Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation, in any such case
(clause (i) or (ii) above) relating to, arising out of or with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
relating to, arising out of or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis
for such termination or

 



103  otherwise). Without limitation of the foregoing, none of Mavericks,
Mavericks Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Claim against, or seek
damages from, any of the Rockets Related Parties in contravention of the
preceding sentence. Under no circumstances shall Mavericks be entitled to
receive more than one (1) Rockets Termination Fee.

 

(j) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) neither the Rockets Termination Fees nor the Mavericks
Termination Fees, as the case may be, is a penalty, and instead each of the
Rockets Termination Fees and the Mavericks Termination Fees, as the case may
be, constitutes liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Mavericks or Rockets, as the case may be, in the circumstances in
which the Rockets Termination Fee or the Mavericks Termination Fee, as the
case may be, is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. If either Mavericks or Rockets fails to pay a
Mavericks Termination Fee, a Rockets Termination Fee, a Mavericks Expense
Reimbursement or a Rockets Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, when
due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a Claim
that results in a judgment against the defaulting Party for such Mavericks
Termination Fee, Rockets Termination Fee, Mavericks Expense Reimbursement or
Rockets Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, the defaulting Party shall
pay to the other Party its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel, fees or other
professionals and experts, and court costs) incurred in connection with such
Claim, together with interest on the amount of such Rockets Termination Fee
or such Mavericks Termination Fee, as the case may be, the Mavericks Expense
Reimbursement or the Rockets Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at
the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

Section 9.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,

each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or other
equitable remedies, to prevent breaches, or threatened breaches, of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause the other Party to effect
the Closing, in any court referred to in _Section 9.5(b)_, without proof of

jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that it will not bring any Claim
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than such courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably

reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.5_,

of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether

execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) any Claim
brought in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such Claim is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,

certified mail, return receipt requested, to such Party at its address set
forth in  _Section 9.7_, and (2) any service pursuant to clause (1) above is
sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such Party in such action or
proceeding and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every
respect. 

Section 9.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CLAIM WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining

provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



108 Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits
and schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement (except for the
fourth, fifth, fifteenth and sixteenth paragraphs of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which paragraphs shall terminate as of, and be of no further force

and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived, in each case
whether before or after the receipt of the Mavericks Stockholder Approval

waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Parties
or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Mavericks
Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall, by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further
approval of the Mavericks Stockholders, the effectiveness of such
amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the Mavericks
Stockholders; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the
Rockets Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the Rockets Stockholders, the effectiveness of
such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the Rockets
Stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Mavericks
or Rockets in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) after the
Effective Time as set forth in _Section 6.11_ and (b) after the Effective
Time, for (i) _Section 3.1_, which is intended to benefit, and is
enforceable by, the holders of Eligible Shares, which are express third-party
beneficiaries of _Section 3.1_, and (ii) _Section 6.7(a)_, which is
intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, the holders of Rockets Equity-
Based Awards, which are express third-party beneficiaries of _Section

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are
