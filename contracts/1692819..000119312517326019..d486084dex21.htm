the Reorganized TCEH Common Stock (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) issued in connection with Mavericks&#146; emergence from the bankruptcy was duly issued in accordance with the Confirmation Order and the Plan of Reorganization. The
Confirmation Order determined that the Plan of Reorganization, including all related agreements and documents necessary to implement the Plan of Reorganization were negotiated in good faith and at arm&#146;s length, and, upon completion of
documentation and execution, are valid, binding, and enforceable and not in conflict with any federal, state, or local law. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, a Mavericks Material Adverse Effect, all documents and agreements
necessary to implement the Plan of Reorganization have been executed. The Confirmation Order authorized Mavericks&#146; predecessor to take any action necessary or appropriate to implement, effectuate, consummate, or further evidence the Plan of
Reorganization in accordance with its terms and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Plan of Reorganization has been substantially consummated, as defined in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(2), and the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization
occurred on October&nbsp;3, 2016. The Confirmation Order is a Final Order. </P>
