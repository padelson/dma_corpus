                              W I T N E S S E T H


      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Buyer and the Board of Directors of
Company have each (i) determined that this Agreement and the business
combination and related transactions contemplated hereby are in the best
interests of their respective entities and shareholders; (ii) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with and
in furtherance of their respective business strategies; and (iii) approved this
Agreement;

      WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) Company will
merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer the surviving entity (the "Merger"); and
(ii) Company Bank will merge with and into Buyer Bank, with Buyer Bank as the
surviving entity (the "Bank Merger");

      WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement,
each of the directors and certain Executive Officers of Company has entered
into a voting agreement with Buyer dated as of the date hereof (a "Voting
Agreement"), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to
which each such director or Executive Officer has agreed, among other things,
to vote all shares of Company Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such
person in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
such agreement; and

      WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement
and to prescribe certain conditions thereto.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                                   THE MERGER

      Section 1.01  The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Buyer in
accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act and the requirements
of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease and Buyer shall
survive and continue to exist as a corporation incorporated under the
<PAGE>

General Laws of Massachusetts (Buyer, as the Surviving Entity in the Merger,
sometimes being referred to herein as the "Surviving Entity").

      Section 1.02  Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity upon consummation of the
Merger shall be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Buyer as in effect
immediately prior to consummation of the Merger.

      Section 1.03  Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity. The
directors of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Merger shall be the
directors of Buyer in office immediately prior to the Effective Time plus the
director appointed to Buyer's Board of Directors pursuant to Section 5.23
hereof. The executive officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after the
Merger shall be the executive officers of Buyer immediately prior to the
Merger. Each of the directors and executive officers of the Surviving Entity
immediately after the Merger shall hold office until his or her successor is
elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Entity.

      Section 1.04  Effective Date and Effective Time; Closing.

            (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer
and Company will make all such filings as may be required to consummate the
Merger by applicable laws and regulations. The Merger provided for herein shall
become effective upon the acceptance for filing by the Massachusetts Secretary
of State of the articles of merger related to the Merger (the "Articles of
Merger"). The date of such filing or such later effective date is herein called
the "Effective Date." The "Effective Time" of the Merger shall be as specified
in the Articles of Merger.

            (b)  A closing (the "Closing") shall take place immediately prior to
the Effective Time at the principal offices of Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP in
Boston, Massachusetts, or such other place or on such other date as the parties
may mutually agree upon (such date, the "Closing Date"). At the Closing, there
shall be delivered to Buyer and Company the certificates and other documents
required to be delivered under Article VI hereof.

      Section 1.05  Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and that the
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code.

                                  ARTICLE II.

             MERGER CONSIDERATION; ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

      Section 2.01  Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Company or any shareholder of Company:

            (a)  Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

                                       2
<PAGE>

            (b)  Each share of Company Common Stock held as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the
Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

            (c)  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock) shall
become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election of the holder
thereof subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.04 either: (i) $25.50
in cash (the "Cash Consideration"); or (ii) 0.818 shares (the "Exchange Ratio")
of Buyer Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). The Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the
"Merger Consideration."

      Section 2.02  Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. All shares of
Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.01(c), shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously evidencing such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of
Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with Sections 2.01(c) and
2.03 and the right to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company
Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common
Stock as provided under this Article II and the right to receive any unpaid
dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring
prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common
Stock, other than transfers of Company Common Stock that have occurred prior to
the Effective Time.

      Section 2.03  Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger.
In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the average of the last sale prices of Buyer Common Stock, as reported on The
Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal
or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), for the five (5)
Nasdaq trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the
nearest whole cent.

      Section 2.04  Election Procedures.

            (a)  An election form and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to a bank or trust company designated by Buyer and reasonably
satisfactory to Company (the "Exchange Agent")) in such form as Company and
Buyer shall mutually agree (the "Election Form"), shall be mailed no more than
forty (40) and no less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Election Deadline (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock. Each

                                       3
<PAGE>

Election Form shall permit the holder of record of Company Common Stock (or in
the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper
instructions and documentation) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration
for all or a portion of such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii) elect to
receive the Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such holder's shares (a
"Stock Election"), or (iii) make no election with respect to the receipt of the
Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration (a "Non-Election"); except as
provided in Section 7.01(i), seventy-five percent (75%) of the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, excluding any Treasury Stock (the "Stock Conversion Number"),
shall be converted into the Stock Consideration and twenty-five percent (25%)
of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the Cash
Consideration. A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on
behalf of other Persons in any way will be entitled to submit an Election Form
for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each
Person for which it so acts. Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Cash
Election has been made are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares
of Company Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made are referred
to herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of Company Common Stock as to
which no election has been made (or as to which an Election Form is not
properly completed and returned in a timely fashion) are referred to herein as
"Non-Election Shares." The aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as
the "Stock Election Number."

            (b)  To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
a date no later than the 5th Business Day prior to the Closing Date to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties (which date shall be publicly announced by
Buyer as soon as practicable prior to such date) (the "Election Deadline"),
accompanied by the Certificates as to which such Election Form is being made or
by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth in
the Election Form, from a member of any registered national securities exchange
or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States (provided that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required
in such guarantee of delivery; failure to deliver shares of Company Common
Stock covered by such guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such
guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made election,
unless otherwise determined by Buyer, in its sole discretion). For shares of
Company Common Stock held in book entry form, Buyer shall establish procedures
for delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to
Company. If a holder of Company Common Stock either (i) does not submit a
properly completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes the
holder's Election Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later submitting
a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline), the shares
of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be designated Non-Election
Shares. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked, and all
Certificates returned, if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Buyer
and Company that this Agreement has been terminated. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any
Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Buyer nor the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

                                       4
<PAGE>

            (c)  The allocation among the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration
will be made as follows:

                  (i)  If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion
            Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares
            shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
            Consideration, and, subject to Section 2.03 hereof, each holder of
            Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock
            Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares
            held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying
            (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
            a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number
            and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the
            remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being
            converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration;

                  (ii)  If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
            Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
            exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
            "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be
            converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the
            Non-Election Shares and the Cash Election Shares shall be treated
            in the following manner:

                        (A)  if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to
                  the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election
                  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
                  Consideration and, subject to Section 2.03 hereof, each
                  holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock
                  Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election
                  Shares held by such holder equal to the product obtained by
                  multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
                  such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                  Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total
                  number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of
                  such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the
                  right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

                        (B)  if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
                  Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be
                  converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration,
                  and, subject to Section 2.03 hereof, each holder of Cash
                  Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
                  respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
                  product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
                  Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
                  numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall
                  Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares

      Section 2.05  Exchange Procedures.

            (a)  On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II ("New
Certificates") and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to
the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article II (including the estimated
amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock)
(such cash and New Certificates, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").

            (b)  As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time, and provided that Company has
delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information
which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as
specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such Certificate
or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have
been converted pursuant to Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.04 of this Agreement. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of Company
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a
check representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and/or (iii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which such former holder has the
right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.05(b), each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Sections 2.01, 2.03 and 2.04 and
any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as provided in paragraph (c) of
this Section 2.05. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash
constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificates.

            (c)  No dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05, the record

                                       6
<PAGE>

holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. None of Buyer, Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

            (d)  The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver cash and/or a New Certificate or New Certificates
representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common
Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.05, or, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such amount as may
be required in each case by Buyer. If any New Certificates evidencing shares of
Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an
executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance
of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not payable.

            (e)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as well as
any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of Company who have not theretofore
complied with Section 2.05(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Entity for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer
Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted
by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of
Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such
property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any
Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Buyer and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any
shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration
represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be
relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

                                       7

            (f)  Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

      Section 2.06  Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Buyer changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer
Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time,
the Exchange Ratio and, if applicable, the Cash Consideration shall be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Buyer Common Stock
if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives
consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party transaction or (ii)
Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards.

      Section 2.07  Options. Each option to purchase Company Common Stock
(collectively, the "Options") granted under Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan or
Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plan"),
whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto
shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and, on the Closing Date, Company or
Company Bank shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in
such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option,
which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all
applicable withholding taxes. Prior to the Closing Date, Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of each holder of
a then-outstanding Option with respect to the termination of the Option and the
payment for such Option in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.07. At
the Effective Time, Company Option Plan shall terminate and the provisions in
any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company shall be of no
further force and effect and shall be deemed to be deleted.

      Section 3.12  Material Contracts; Defaults.

            (a)  Other than as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.12,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject

employees or consultants, (ii) which would entitle any present or former
director, officer, employee or agent of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
indemnification from Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the benefits of

Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on
the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) which

            (b)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under
any contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or
other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or

      Section 3.13  Brokers. Neither Company nor any of its officers or

<PAGE>

delivered by Company to Buyer or Buyer Bank.

      Section 3.14  Employee Benefit Plans.

            (a)  All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") and current or former directors of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred
compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock
based, incentive and bonus plans (the "Company Benefit Plans"), are identified
in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14. True and complete copies of all Company
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, have been made available to Buyer or Buyer Bank.

            (b)  All Company Benefit Plans other than "multiemployer plans"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, covering Company Employees, to
the extent subject to ERISA, are in substantial compliance with ERISA. Each
Company Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Company Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, and Company is not aware of any
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or,
to Company's Knowledge, threatened litigation relating to the Company Benefit
Plans. Other than as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable
period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

            (c)  No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any entity which is considered one employer
with Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). None of Company or any ERISA Affiliate
has contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the six-year
period ending on the Closing Date, and neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal
liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required
to be filed for any Company Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the
12 month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                      16
<PAGE>

            (d)  All contributions required to be made with respect to all
Company Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the
financial statements of Company. No Company Pension Plan or single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or
not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

            (e)  Other than as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, other than coverage as
may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA,
or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any state or
locality. Company may amend or terminate any such Company Benefit Plan at any
time without incurring any liability thereunder.

            (f)  Other than as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14,
the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(i) entitle any Company Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Company Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment that would
be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are
defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future, (v) limit or restrict the right of Company or Company Bank or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit
Plans, or (vi) result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which
would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

            (g)  Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14 includes the Severance Pay
Plan of Slade's Ferry Trust Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement
and provides a true and correct schedule of the severance payments that would
be due to each employee who would be eligible to receive severance benefits
thereunder upon termination of employment after the Effective Time, assuming
for this purpose that the Effective Time occurs after January 31, 2008. Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.14 sets forth a true and correct copy of the
interpretation of the Severance Pay Plan that the Plan Administrator of the
Severance Pay Plan adopted on or before the date of this Agreement.

            (h)  Each Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan
is in substantial compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. All elections made with respect to compensation deferred under an
arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code have been made in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409(a)(4) of the Code, to the extent
applicable. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has taken any
action, or has failed to take any action, that has resulted or could reasonably
be expected to result in the interest and tax penalties specified in Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code being owed by any participant in a Company Benefit
Plan or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any

                                      17
<PAGE>

participant in a Company Benefit Plan for any of the interest and the penalties
specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be currently due or
triggered in the future.

            (i)  Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14 contains a schedule showing
the present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in
such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as tax indemnification payments in respect of income or
excise taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or similar
contract, plan or arrangement with or which covers any present or former
director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who may be
entitled to any such amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of
the in-kind benefits due under any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying
the assumptions in such schedule.

      Section 3.15  Labor Matters. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor
is there any proceeding pending or, to Company's Knowledge threatened,
asserting that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended)
or seeking to compel Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any
labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any
strike or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to Company's Knowledge,
threatened, nor is Company aware of any activity involving its employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity.

      Section 3.16  Environmental Matters.

            (a)  Other than as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16, to
Company's Knowledge, no real property (including buildings or other structures)
currently or formerly owned or operated by Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any property in which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has held a security
interest, Lien or a fiduciary or management role ("Company Loan Property"), has
been contaminated with, or has had any release of, any Hazardous Substance in a
manner that violates Environmental Law. Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16 lists
each ASTM 1527-05 Phase I environmental assessment ("Phase I Assessment") and
Phase II environmental assessment ("Phase II Assessment" and, together with the
Phase I Assessments, the "Environmental Assessments") which, to Company's
Knowledge, have been conducted on the properties listed on Company Disclosure
Schedule 3.28, copies of which Environmental Assessments have previously been
delivered to Buyer.

            (b)  Except as disclosed on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16,
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with applicable
Environmental Law.

            (c)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries could be deemed the
owner or operator of, or to have participated in the management of, any Company
Loan Property which has been contaminated with, or has had any release of, any
Hazardous Substance in a manner that violates Environmental Law.

                                      18
<PAGE>

            (d)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
for Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any third party property
which are in amounts or under conditions that require remediation or removal
under applicable Environmental Law.

            (e)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received (i)
any written notice, demand letter, or claim alleging any violation of, or
liability under, any Environmental Law or (ii) to Company's Knowledge, any
written request for information reasonably indicating an investigation or other
inquiry by any Government Authority concerning a possible violation of, or
liability under, any Environmental Law.

            (f)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been,
subject to any order, decree or injunction relating to a violation of any
Environmental Law.

            (g)  Except as disclosed on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16, to
Company's Knowledge, there are no circumstances or conditions (including the
presence of asbestos, underground storage tanks, lead products, polychlorinated
biphenyls, prior manufacturing operations, dry-cleaning, or automotive
services) involving Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any currently or formerly
owned or operated property, or any Company Loan Property, that could reasonably
be expected pursuant to applicable Environmental Law to (i) result in any
claim, liability or investigation against Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) result in any restriction on the ownership, use, or transfer of any
property, or (iii) adversely affect the value of any Company Loan Property.

            (h)  Company has delivered to Buyer copies of all environmental
reports, studies, sampling data, correspondence, filings and other information
in its possession or reasonably available to it relating to environmental
conditions at or on any real property (including buildings or other structures)
currently or formerly owned or operated by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Company Loan Property.

            (i)  There is no litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Company,
threatened against Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or affecting any
property now or formerly owned or used by Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or affecting any Company Loan Property, before any court, or Governmental
Authority (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with any
Environmental Law or (ii) relating to the release into the environment of any
Hazardous Substance, whether or not occurring at, on or involving a Company
Loan Property.

            (j)  Except as disclosed on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16, to
Company's Knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks on, in or under any
property currently owned or operated by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any Company Loan Property and, to the Knowledge of Company, no underground
storage tank has been closed or removed from any Company Loan Property except
in compliance with Environmental Law.

      Section 3.17  Tax Matters.

            (a)  Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns
that it was required to file under applicable laws and regulations, other than
Tax Returns that are not yet due

                                      19
<PAGE>

or for which a request for extension was filed consistent with requirements of
applicable law or regulation. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in
all material respects and have been prepared in substantial compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations. Except as set forth in Company Disclosure
Schedule 3.17, Taxes due and owing by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid other than Taxes that
have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of Company and which Company
is contesting in good faith. Company is not the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, and neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years. No claim has ever been made by
an authority in a jurisdiction where Company does not file Tax Returns that it
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for
Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party.

            (c)  No foreign, federal, state, or local tax audits or
administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to the
Knowledge of Company are pending with respect to Company. Company has not
received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority (including
jurisdictions where Company has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice
indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for
information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing
authority against Company.

            (d)  Company has provided Buyer or Buyer Bank with true and complete
copies of the United States federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax
Returns filed with respect to Company for taxable periods ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004. Company has delivered to Buyer or Buyer Bank correct and
complete copies of all examination reports, and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by any of Company filed for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Company has timely and properly taken such

the IRS in respect of information reporting and backup and nonresident
withholding as are required by law.

Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or

            (f)  Company has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable
period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Company has disclosed on its
federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to
a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code
Section 6662. Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement. Company (i) has not been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was Company), and (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of any
individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company,
business trust, limited liability company, or

                                      20
<PAGE>

unincorporated organization (other than Company) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise.

            (g)  The unpaid Taxes of Company (i) did not, as of the end of the
most recent period covered by Company's call reports filed on or prior to the
date hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the financial statements included in Company's
call reports filed on or prior to the date hereof (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice
of Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since the end of the most recent period
covered by Company's call reports filed prior to the date hereof, Company has
not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or
losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past custom and practice.

            (h)  Company shall not be required to include any item of income in,
or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i)
change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section 7121 (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transactions
or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Code Section
1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
income Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on
or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date.

            (i)  Company has not distributed stock of another Person or had its
stock distributed by another Person in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of
the Code.

      Section 3.18  Investment Securities. Company Disclosure Schedule 3.18 sets
forth as of September 30, 2007 the investment securities, mortgage backed
securities and securities held for sale of Company, as well as, with respect to
such securities, descriptions thereof, CUSIP numbers, book values, fair values
and coupon rates.

      Section 3.19  Derivative Transactions.

            (a)  All Derivative Transactions entered into by Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or for the account of any of its customers were entered into
in accordance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory policies
of any Governmental Authority, and in accordance with the investment,
securities, commodities, risk management and other policies, practices and
procedures employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and were entered
into with counterparties believed at the time to be financially responsible and
able to understand (either alone or in consultation with its advisers) and to
bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have duly performed all of their obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued,

                                      21
<PAGE>

and, to the Knowledge of Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults
or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

            (b)  Except as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.19, no
Derivative Transaction, were it to be a Loan held by Company, would be
classified as "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List" or words of similar import. Each such Derivative Transaction is listed on
Company Disclosure Schedule 3.19, and the financial position of Company under
or with respect to each has been reflected in the books and records of Company
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and no open exposure of Company
with respect to any such instrument (or with respect to multiple instruments
with respect to any single counterparty) exceeds $25,000.

      Section 3.20  Regulatory Capitalization. Company Bank is, and immediately
after the Effective Time will be, "well capitalized," as such term is defined
in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FDIC. Company is, and
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, "well capitalized" as such
term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB.

      Section 3.21  Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets.

            (a)  Except as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.21, as of
the date hereof, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
written or oral (i) loan, loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement
(including, without limitation, leases, credit enhancements, commitments,
guarantees and interest-bearing assets) (collectively, "Loans"), under the
terms of which the obligor was, as of June 30, 2007, over sixty (60) days
delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default of any other
material provision, or (ii) Loan with any director, Executive Officer or five
percent or greater shareholder of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
Knowledge of Company, any person, corporation or enterprise controlling,
controlled by or under common control with any of the foregoing. Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.21 identifies (x) each Loan that as of September 30, 2007
was classified as "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List" or words of similar import by Company, Company Bank or any bank examiner,
together with the principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on each
such Loan and the identity of the borrower thereunder, and (y) each asset of
Company that as of September 30, 2007 was classified as other real estate owned
("OREO") and the book value thereof as of the date of this Agreement.

            (b)  Each Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other
evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport to be,
(ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens which have been
perfected and (iii) to the Knowledge of Company, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles.

            (c)  All currently outstanding Loans were solicited, originated and,
currently exist in material compliance with all applicable requirements of Law
and Company Bank's lending policies at the time of origination of such Loans,
and the loan documents with respect to each such Loan are complete and correct.
There are no oral modifications or amendments or

                                      22
<PAGE>

additional agreements related to the Loans that are not reflected in the
written records of Company Bank. Other than loans pledged to the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Boston, all such Loans are owned by Company Bank free and clear of
any Liens. No claims of defense as to the enforcement of any Loan have been
asserted in writing against Company Bank for which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse determination, and each of Company and Company Bank
is aware of no acts or omissions which would give rise to any claim or right of

or operation of any material asset.

            (b)  Company Disclosure Schedule 3.28 sets forth a true, correct and
complete schedule of all leases, subleases, licenses and other agreements under

effect and, as of the date hereof, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received a written notice of, and otherwise has no Knowledge of any,

of Company as currently conducted. The Company Intellectual Property owned by

ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required
to be filed for any Buyer Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12
month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in

            (d)  All contributions required to be made with respect to all Buyer
Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the financial
statements of Buyer. No Buyer Pension Plan or single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

      Section 4.14  Labor Matters. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
there any proceeding pending or, to Buyer's Knowledge threatened, asserting
that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice
(within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended) or seeking
to compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to Buyer's Knowledge,
threatened, nor is Buyer aware of any activity involving its employees seeking
to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity.

      Section 4.15  Tax Matters.

            (a)  Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns
that it was required to file under applicable laws and regulations, other than
Tax Returns that are not yet due or for which a request for extension was filed
consistent with requirements of applicable law or regulation. All such Tax
Returns were correct and complete in all material respects and have been
prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
All Taxes due and owing by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return) have been paid other than Taxes that have been
reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of Buyer and which Buyer is contesting
in good faith. Buyer is not the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return, and neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently has any open tax years. No claim has ever been made by an authority
in a jurisdiction where Buyer does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other
than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries.

            (b)  Buyer has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party.

            (c)  No foreign, federal, state, or local tax audits or
administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to the
Knowledge of Buyer are pending with respect to Buyer. Buyer has not received
from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority (including
jurisdictions where Buyer has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating
an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information
related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment
for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority
against Buyer.

            (d)  Buyer has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.

                                      32
<PAGE>

            (e)  The unpaid Taxes of Buyer (i) did not, as of the end of the
most recent period covered by Buyer's call reports filed on or prior to the
date hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the financial statements included in Buyer's
call reports filed on or prior to the date hereof (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice
of Buyer in filing its Tax Returns. Since the end of the most recent period
covered by Buyer's call reports filed prior to the date hereof, Buyer has not
incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as
that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business consistent
with past custom and practice.

      Section 4.16 Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in
this Article IV, when considered as a whole, do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements and information contained in this Article IV not
misleading.

            (a)  Buyer and Company agree to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement to be filed by Buyer with the SEC in connection with the

Each of Buyer and Company agree to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the

all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other
hand, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus, the Merger or any other filing. If at any time prior to
the Company Meeting there shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration
Statement, Company and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to
promptly prepare, file with the SEC (if required under applicable Law) and mail
to Company's shareholders such amendment or supplement. Buyer shall not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the
purpose of resale by Company's shareholders who may be Affiliates of Company or
Buyer pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

            (d)  Buyer will provide Company and its counsel with a reasonable

respect to, or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic
information relating to a Acquisition Proposal to, any Person that has made or,
to the Knowledge of Company, is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) engage in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal with any Person
that has made, or, to Company's Knowledge, is considering making, an
Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.09.

            (b)  Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a), prior to the time, but not
after, the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, if Company
receives a written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of Company reasonably believes to be credible, which the Board of
Directors of Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, Company may take the following actions: (1)
furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
but only if (A) prior to so furnishing such information, Company has entered
into a customary confidentiality agreement with such Person, and (B) all such
information has previously been provided to Buyer or is provided to Buyer prior
to or contemporaneously with the time it is provided to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such Person's representatives, and (2) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to
the Acquisition Proposal. Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours)
shall advise Buyer orally and in writing of the receipt of (i) any proposal
that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms of such proposal (including the identity of the
party making such proposal and, if applicable, copies of any documents or
correspondence evidencing such proposal), and (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests
for information not reasonably expected to be related to an Acquisition
Proposal. Company shall, thereafter, keep Buyer reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including any material change to the terms thereof).

            (c)  Except as provided in Section 5.09(d), Board of Directors of
Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw or modify (or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Buyer, its recommendation
referred to in Section 5.04, or (ii) approve or recommend (or publicly propose
to approve or recommend ) any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that
Company's Board of Directors may take no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal that takes the form of a tender offer until the close of
business as of the tenth Business Day after the commencement of such tender
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-

                                      41
<PAGE>

2 under the Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse
modification). Company shall not, and its Board of Directors shall not allow
Company to, and Company shall not allow any of Company's Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (except for
customary confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.09(b)) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal.

            (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Company may, prior to but not after the
time the Requisite Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, (i) make a Change
in its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04 and/or (ii) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, in each case of clauses (i) or (ii), if the
Board of Directors of Company has determined in good faith, after consulting
with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that the Board of Directors may not take any such action in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal unless (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (2) prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(g)(iii), Company provides prior written notice to Buyer at least three
Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") of its intention to take such
action, which notice shall specify all material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal and copies of any documents or correspondence evidencing such Superior
Proposal), and any material modifications to any of the foregoing, (3) during
the Notice Period Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and
outside counsel to, negotiate with Buyer in good faith should Buyer propose to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith judgment of
Company's Board of Directors) a Superior Proposal and (4) such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute (in the good faith judgment of Company's Board
of Directors) a Superior Proposal after taking into account any such amendments
that Buyer shall have agreed to make prior to the end of the Notice Period.

            (e)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall prohibit Company
from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state
law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to
Company's shareholders if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
Company determines that such disclosure would be required under applicable Law
or (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in
this Section 5.09.

      Section 5.10  Indemnification.

            (a)  From and after the Effective Time, Buyer (the "Indemnifying
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of Company, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred after the Effective Time in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or
she was a director or officer of Company or is or was serving at the request of
Company as a

                                      42
<PAGE>

director, officer, employee or other agent of any other organization or in any
capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Company, including
without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
to the full extent to which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under
the Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement as though such
Bylaws continue to remain in effect after the Effective Time (subject to
applicable Law). Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.10(a) shall continue
in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such claim.

            (b)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying
Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that indemnification of
an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction.

            (c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall and if Company is
unable to, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A coverage
part (directors' and officers' liability) of Company's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies, and (ii) Company's existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "D&O Insurance") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby) ; provided that
in no event shall Company expend,

                                      43
<PAGE>

or Buyer or the Surviving Entity be required to expend, for such "tail" policy
a premium amount in excess of an amount (the "Maximum D&O Tail Premium") equal
to (x) 225% of the annual premiums paid by Company for D & O Insurance in
effect as of the date of this Agreement less (y) the premium credit, if any, to
which Company is entitled on account of the Merger under the D&O Insurance in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided further, that if the
cost of such a tail policy exceeds the Maximum D&O Tail Premium, Company, Buyer
or the Surviving Entity shall obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding Maximum D&O Tail Premium.

            (d)  If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

      Section 5.11  Employees; Benefit Plans.

            (a)  Buyer shall retain all Company Employees who accept employment
with Buyer Bank under the terms and conditions specified by Buyer; provided,
that continued retention by Buyer Bank of such employees subsequent to the
Merger shall be subject to Buyer Bank's normal and customary employment
procedures and practices, including customary background screening and
evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance. In addition,
Company and Company Bank agree that Buyer may enter into discussions with the
Company Employees listed on Schedule 5.11(a) hereto regarding employment,
consulting or other arrangements to be effective following the Merger.

            (b)  Following the Closing Date, Buyer may choose to maintain any or
all of Company Benefit Plans in its sole discretion. However, for any Company
Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan of
general applicability, Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in
such Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of
Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in
the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur, if at all, at different times with respect
to different plans). Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer
Bank to amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

            (c)  If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or Buyer
Bank upon termination of such plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer
shall make all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are
covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Buyer or Buyer
Bank, (ii) honor under such plans, other than plans funded with insurance, any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and
their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such employee had
satisfied

                                      44
<PAGE>

any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to the
Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

            (d)  With respect to each Company Benefit Plan subject to Section
409A of the Code, Company agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such
plan to be amended to the extent, in Buyer's reasonable judgment, such an
amendment is necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code (or to cause
such plan, in whole or in part, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the
Code by preserving the terms of such plan, and the law in effect, for benefits
earned and vested as of December 31, 2004) prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the deadline imposed by the IRS. Such amendments shall be
provided to Buyer and its counsel at least ten days prior to their proposed
adoption by Company or Company Bank and shall be subject to the prior approval
of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (e)  During the one-year period commencing as of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Buyer shall honor with respect to Company employees
who commence employment as of the Effective Time with Buyer as contemplated by
this Agreement the Severance Pay Plan of Slade's Ferry Bank (the "Company
Severance Pay Plan") in connection with the termination of employment of any
Company Employee (excluding any employee who is party to an employment
agreement, change-in-control agreement or any other agreement which provides
for severance payments), in such amounts, at such times and upon such
conditions as set forth in the Company Severance Pay Plan with respect to
involuntary employment terminations for reasons other than cause that occur.

            (f)  Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this Section 5.11 will create any third party beneficiary rights
in any current or former employee, director or consultant of Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any
other matter. Nothing in this Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any Benefit
Plan, (ii) interfere with Buyer's or the Surviving Entity's right from and
after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or (iii)
interfere with Buyer's or the Surviving Entity's right from and after the
Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by any
director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

            (g)  Upon Buyer's reasonable request, Company shall cooperate with
Buyer to facilitate the termination, on or after the Closing Date, of each
Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, provided
that such termination is effected in a manner that does not adversely affect
such plan's qualification under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. Buyer
and Company shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such a termination and
the associated distribution of all assets of each such terminated Company
Benefit Plan. In no event shall the assets of any Company Benefit Plan
terminated pursuant to this Section 5.16(g) be distributed in any form or at
any time not approved in writing in advance by Buyer.

            (h)  Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
"employee welfare benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
known as the Severance Pay Plan of Slade's Ferry Bank to be administered at all
times in accordance with the requirements for

                                      45
<PAGE>

exemption from Section 409A of the Code available under Treasury Regulation
section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii).

            (i)  Buyer and Company shall jointly develop and implement within
thirty (30) days from the date of this Agreement retention arrangements for
such Company Bank employees as Buyer and Company may mutually agree.

      Section 5.12  Notification of Certain Changes. Buyer and Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the
date prior to the Closing Date), Company will supplement or amend the Company
Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this
Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described
in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information
in the Company Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby.
No supplement or amendment to the Company Disclosure Schedules shall have any
effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the parties contained in Article III and Article IV in order to
determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a) or
6.03(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by Company or Buyer, as
the case may be, with the respective covenants and agreements of such parties
contained herein.

      Section 5.13  Current Information. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, Company will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less
than weekly) with representatives of Buyer and to report the general status of
the ongoing operations of Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the foregoing, Company agrees to provide Buyer (i) a copy of each
report filed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental
Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing thereof, (ii) a
consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations, without
related notes, within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month,
prepared in accordance with Company's current financial reporting practices,
and (iii) regular updates of the information set forth in Schedule 5.13.

      Section 5.14  Board Packages. Company shall distribute a copy of any
Company or Company Bank Board package, including the agenda and any draft
minutes, to Buyer at the same time and in the same manner in which it
distributes a copy of such package to the Board of Directors of Company or
Company Bank, as the case may be; provided, however, that Company shall not be
required to copy Buyer on any documents that disclose confidential discussions
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any third party
proposal to acquire control of Company or any other matter that Company's Board
of Directors has been advised of by counsel that such distribution to Buyer may
violate a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any law or
regulation.

      Section 5.15  Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after
the date hereof, Buyer and Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
facilitate the integration of

                                      46
<PAGE>

Company with the business of Buyer following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for
the conversion of the data processing and related electronic informational

limited to, (a) discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of

proprietary or self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions
necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. Buyer shall indemnify Company for any reasonable
out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that Company may incur as a result of
taking, at the request of Buyer, any action to facilitate the Informational
Systems Conversion.

      Section 5.16  Access to Customers and Suppliers. From and after the date
hereof, Company shall, upon Buyer's reasonable request, introduce Buyer and its
representatives to customers and suppliers of Company and its Subsidiaries for
the purpose of facilitating the integration of Company and its business into
that of the Buyer. Any interaction between Buyer and Company's customers and
suppliers shall be coordinated by Company. Company shall have the right to
participate in any discussions between Buyer and Company's customers and
suppliers.

      Section 5.17  Environmental Assessments.

            (a)  Company shall cooperate with and grant access to an
environmental consulting firm selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to
Company, during normal business hours (and at such other times as may be
agreed), to any property set forth on Company Disclosure Schedule 3.28 for the
purpose of conducting (i) Phase I Assessments (which also may include an
evaluation of asbestos containing materials, lead based paint, lead in drinking
water, mold and radon) and (ii) Phase II Assessments.

            (b)  Each Environmental Assessment shall include an estimate by the
environmental consulting firm preparing such Environmental Assessment of the
costs of investigation, monitoring, personal injury, property damage, clean up,
remediation, penalties, fines or other liabilities, as the case may be,
relating to the "potential environmental condition(s)" or "recognized
environmental condition(s)" or other conditions which are the subject of the
Environmental Assessment.

            (c)  Buyer shall bear and pay the environmental consulting firm's
fees and expenses. Within ten (10) days after the date hereof, Buyer shall
engage an environmental consultant reasonably acceptable to Company to perform
the Phase I Assessments. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its environmental consultant to complete and provide Buyer with its
written Phase I Assessment(s) within thirty (30) days after such consultant is
retained. Promptly following the receipt of all Phase I Assessments (but not
later than ten (10) days thereafter), Buyer shall order all applicable Phase II
Assessments. Buyer shall use

                                      47
<PAGE>

commercially reasonable efforts to have all Environmental Assessments completed
within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement.

      Section 5.18  Certain Litigation. Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve, within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement and
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, the dispute described on Schedule

the Merger. In the event that any shareholder litigation related to this
Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is brought, or, to Company's Knowledge, threatened, against Company
and/or the members of the board of directors of Company prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall give Buyer the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

Company and keep Buyer reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.

cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

Board of Directors of Buyer and the Board of Directors of Buyer Bank each shall
increase by one (1) the number of directors constituting the entire Boards of
Directors of Buyer and Buyer Bank, espectively, effective as of and contingent

      Section 5.24  Coordination.

            (a)  Company shall take any actions Buyer may reasonably request
prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the consolidation of the operations
of Company Bank with Buyer Bank. Without limiting the foregoing, senior
officers of Company and Buyer shall meet from time to time as Company may

review the financial and operational affairs of Company and Company Bank, and
Company shall give due consideration to Buyer's input on such matters, with the
understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time.

Bank to divest itself of such investment securities and loans as are identified

however, that no such modifications, changes or divestitures need be made prior
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01(a) and
6.01(b), and (iii) Company shall make such accruals under the Company Benefit
Plans as Buyer may reasonably request to reflect the benefits payable under
such Company Benefit Plans upon the completion of the Merger.

            (c)  Company and Company Bank shall, consistent with GAAP and
regulatory accounting principles, use their reasonable best efforts to
implement at Buyer's request internal control procedures which are consistent
with Buyer's and Buyer Bank's current internal control procedures to allow

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provided, however, that no such modifications,
changes or divestitures need be made prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6.01(a) and 6.01(b).

            (d)  No accrual or reserve or change in policy or procedure made by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.24 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustment shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously
furnished financial

                                      49
<PAGE>

statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Company
or its management with any such adjustments.

      Section 5.25  Transactional Expenses. The Company has provided at Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.34 a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees
that Company and its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Company Expenses"). Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the

            (d)  Breach of Representations and Warranties. By either Buyer or
Company (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is not
cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following written notice to
the party committing such breach from the other party hereto or (ii) two (2)
Business Days prior to the Termination Date, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(d) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all
other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation or
warranty not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section
6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) (in the case of a breach of a representation or
warranty by Company) or Section 6.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a

party, which breach shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (i)
thirty (30) days following written notice to the party committing such breach
from the other party hereto or (ii) two (2) Business Days prior to the
Termination Date, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Closing, provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) unless the breach of
covenant or agreement, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the
party receiving the benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the
Merger under Section 6.02(b) (in the case of a breach of a covenant or
agreement by Company) or Section 6.03(b) in the case of a breach of a

            (f)  Delay. By either Buyer or Company if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before April 30, 2008 (the "Termination Date"), unless

            (g)  Superior Proposal. By Company if at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Shareholder
Approval, Company receives an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that

            Board of Directors of Company in good faith that such Acquisition
            Proposal is a Superior Proposal;

                  (ii)  Company concurrently pays the Termination Fee payable
            pursuant to Section 7.02; and

                  (iii)  the Board of Directors of Company concurrently
            approves, and Company concurrently enters into, a definitive
            agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

            (h)  Failure to Recommend; Third-Party Acquisition Transaction; Etc.
At any time prior to the Company Meeting, by Buyer if (i) Company shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 5.09, (ii) the Board of
Directors of Company shall have failed to make its recommendation referred to
in Section 5.04 or withdrawn such recommendation or modified or changed such
recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of Buyer,
whether or not permitted by Section 5.09, (iii) the Board of Directors of
Company shall have recommended, proposed, or publicly announced its intention
to recommend or propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any
Person other than Buyer or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer, whether or not
permitted by Section 5.09, or (iv) Company shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section 5.04 by failing to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section 5.04.

            (i)  Possible Adjustment. By Company by giving written notice to
Buyer not later than the end of the second Business Day after the tenth Nasdaq
trading day immediately following the Determination Date, in the event that
both of the following conditions are satisfied:

                                      54
<PAGE>

                  (i)  the Average Closing Price shall be less than 80% of the
            Reference Price; and

                  (ii)  the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
            Price by the Reference Price (the "Buyer Ratio") is less than the
            number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial
            Index Price and then multiplying the quotient in this clause by .80
            (the "Index Ratio").

      If Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
      Section 7.01(i), it shall give written notice to Buyer. During the
      five-Business-Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
      Buyer may, at its sole option (the "Fill Option"), offer to either (x)
      adjust the Exchange Ratio to a level equal to a quotient (rounded to the
      nearest one thousandth), the numerator of which is the product of the
      Reference Price multiplied by the lesser of the Index Ratio or .80
      multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator
      of which is the Average Closing Price, or (y) augment the Stock
      Consideration with a cash payment per share of Company Common Stock in
      the amount equal to (1) if the Index Ratio is greater than or equal to
      0.8, the sum obtained by subtracting the Average Closing Price from 80%
      of the Reference Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, or (2) the sum
      obtained by subtracting (a) the product of the Average Closing Price
      multiplied by the Exchange Ratio from (b) the product of the Reference
      Price multiplied by the Index Ratio multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
      Buyer may not exercise its Fill Option under clause (y) of the
      immediately preceding sentence if it would preclude satisfaction of the
      condition in Section 6.01(f). If Buyer makes either of the elections
      contemplated by this Section 7.01(i), it shall give prompt written notice
      to Company of such adjusted Stock Consideration, and any references in
      this Agreement to "Stock Consideration" shall thereafter be deemed to
      refer to the Stock Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this Section
      7.01(i).

      If Buyer or any company belonging to the Index Group declares or effects
      a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
      combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date
      of the Agreement and the valuation date, the prices for the common stock
      of such company will be appropriately adjusted.

      Section 7.02  Termination Fee; Reimbursement.

            (a)  In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by Buyer while structuring and pursuing the Merger, Company shall pay
to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds a termination fee
equal to $3,500,000 (the "Termination Fee")

                  (i)  in the event Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
            to Section 7.01(g), in which case Company shall pay the Termination
            Fee at or prior to the time of such termination, and

                  (ii)  in the event Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
            Section 7.01(h), in which case Company shall pay the Termination
            Fee as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3)
            Business Days).

                                      55
<PAGE>

            (b)  In the event that (A) (I) an Acquisition Proposal, whether or
not conditional, shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated
or made known to Company's senior management or the Board of Directors of
Company (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made
known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal) or (II) the Board of Directors of Company shall have withheld,
withdrawn or modified (or publicly proposed to withhold, withdraw or modify),
in a manner adverse to Buyer, its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04 to
the extent permitted under Section 5.09(c) prior to or on the date of the
Company Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which the vote
on the Merger is held, (B) this Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or Section 7.01(f) or by Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e), and (C) within 12 months following the date
of such termination, Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Transaction, or Company consummates any Acquisition Transaction
(whether or not such Acquisition Transaction resulted from or was related to
the Acquisition Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (A)(I), if
applicable), then Company shall pay Buyer the Termination Fee, less the Buyer
Reimbursement Amount, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on or prior to the earlier of Company entering into
a definitive agreement for or consummating such Acquisition Transaction.

            (c)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer under
the provisions referred to in clause (B) of Section 7.02(b) (or could have been
terminated under such section) and the circumstances referred to in clause
(A)(I) or (A)(II) of Section 7.02(b) shall have occurred prior to such
termination but the Termination Fee has not been paid and is not payable
because the circumstances referred to in clause (C) of Section 7.02(b) shall
not have occurred, then Company shall pay at Buyer's direction as promptly as
possible (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) following receipt of
an invoice therefor up to $750,000 of Buyer's and its Subsidiaries reasonably
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Buyer and its Subsidiaries prior to the termination of
this Agreement proximately in connection with the negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer and Buyer Bank (the "Buyer
Reimbursement Amount").

            (d)  Company and Buyer each agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due under
this Section 7.02 and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Company for such amounts, Company shall pay
interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the
date of actual payment at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (x) the rate
of interest published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition (or any successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime
rate on the date such payment was due, plus (y) 200 basis points, together with
the costs and expenses of Buyer (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit.

      Section 7.03  Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this Article VII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in
Section 7.02 and Section 9.01 and (ii) that termination will not relieve a
breaching

                                      56
<PAGE>

party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.
