iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), made and entered into as
of the 15th day of November, 2007, by and among PFIZER INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Acquiror"), CORVETTE ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
(the "Acquisition Subsidiary"), and COLEY PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Coley").

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquisition Subsidiary has approved, and
declared it to be advisable and in the best interests of its stockholder, for
Acquisition Subsidiary to consummate the Offer (as defined below) and the
Merger (as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
provided herein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Coley has determined that it is in the
best interests of Coley and its stockholders to approve Acquisition
Subsidiarys proposed acquisition and has resolved (i) to recommend that the
stockholders of Coley accept the Offer (as defined below) and tender their
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Coley Common Stock"),
including the associated preferred stock purchase rights (the "Rights") issued
pursuant to the Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated as of October 5, 2007
(the "Rights Agreement"), between Coley and Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
(the Coley Common Stock together with the Rights are referred to collectively
as the "Coley Shares"), pursuant to the Offer and (ii) to approve and declare
advisable the merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Subsidiary with and into
Coley, with Coley being the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware ("DGCL") following consummation of the Offer;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, Acquisition Subsidiary will make a
cash tender offer (the "Offer") in compliance with Section 14(d)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding Coley Shares for $8.00 per Coley Share (such amount, or any
greater amount per Coley Share paid pursuant to the Offer, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Per Share Amount"), net to the sellers in
cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and that
the Offer will be followed by the Merger, pursuant to which each issued and
outstanding Coley Share not owned by Acquisition Subsidiary or Acquiror
(other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) will be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Amount, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions provided herein;

WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition of Acquirors willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders will concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement enter into an agreement with Acquiror (the "Tender
Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have
agreed to tender all of their Coley Shares in the Offer, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Coley has received the opinion of J. P.
Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") that the consideration to be received by
the holders of Coley Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to
such holders from a financial point of view;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  | ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

1.1 _The Offer._

(a) Not later than the first business day after the date of this Agreement,
Acquiror, Acquisition Subsidiary and Coley will make a public announcement
of the Offer.

(b) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1 and none of the events set forth in _Annex A_ hereto shall
have occurred or be existing, Acquisition Subsidiary shall commence, and
Acquiror shall cause Acquisition Subsidiary to commence, within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the
initial public announcement of Acquisition Subsidiarys intention to commence
the Offer, which announcement will be made on November 16, 2007. The
obligation of Acquisition Subsidiary to accept for payment and pay for Coley
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, including the
condition that a number of Coley Shares representing that number of Coley
Shares which would equal more than fifty percent (50%) of the Coley Shares
then issued and outstanding on a fully-diluted basis shall have been validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration
date of the Offer, and not withdrawn (the "Minimum Condition"). Acquisition
Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any such condition, to
increase the Per Share Amount and to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior
written consent of Coley, Acquisition Subsidiary will not (i) decrease the Per
Share Amount, (ii) reduce the maximum number of Coley Shares to be purchased
in the Offer, (iii) change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer,
(iv) add to, modify or supplement the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex A_ hereto in any manner adverse to the holders of Coley Shares, (v)
extend the expiration date of the Offer beyond the twenty (20) business days
following the commencement thereof, except as expressly provided herein, or
(vi) make any other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer which is
adverse to the holders of Coley Shares. The Per Share Amount shall, subject to
any applicable withholding of taxes, be net to each seller in cash, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Offer, Acquisition Subsidiary shall, and Acquiror shall
cause Acquisition Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay, as promptly as
practicable after expiration of the Offer, for all Coley Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn (the "Acceptance Time").

(c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Acquiror and Acquisition
Subsidiary shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO"),
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and the forms of
related letters of transmittal (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and
such other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto,
being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). The Offer
Documents will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to Coleys stockholders, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; except that in complying with the foregoing commitments,
Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary may rely on the accuracy of any
information provided in writing by Coley for inclusion or  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  incorporation by reference into the Offer Documents. Coley, Acquiror and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall correct promptly any information provided by any
of them for use in the Offer Documents which shall become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Coley Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. Coley and its counsel shall be given the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary shall
provide Coley and its counsel with a copy of, and shall consult with Coley
regarding any telephonic notification of any oral comments, and shall
consult with Coley before responding to any written comments, in each case
that Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt thereof. In the
event that Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary receives any comments from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, each shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) respond promptly to such comments and
(ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, Eastern Time, on the date that is twenty (20) business days
after the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act); _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent
of Coley, Acquisition Subsidiary may (i) extend the Offer, if at the
scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions set forth in
_Annex A_ shall not have been satisfied or waived, for one (1) or more periods
of not more than ten (10) business days each, until such time as such
conditions are satisfied or waived, not to exceed thirty (30) business days in
the aggregate, (ii) extend the Offer for one (1) or more periods if required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer, not more than the period or periods required
by such rule, regulation, interpretation or position, or (iii) extend the
Offer for one (1) or more periods for an aggregate period of not more than
twenty (20) business days beyond the latest expiration date that would
otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence if, on such
expiration date, there shall not have been tendered that number of Coley
Shares which would equal more than ninety percent (90%) of the issued and
outstanding Coley Shares on a fully-diluted basis; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Acquisition Subsidiary shall extend the Offer pursuant to this clause
(iii), Acquisition Subsidiary shall waive during such extension all conditions
set forth in _Annex A_ other than the Minimum Condition and the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) in _Annex A_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary may, without the consent of
Coley, extend the offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act. In
addition, the Per Share Amount may be increased and the Offer may be extended
to the extent required by Law in connection with such increase, in each case
without the consent of Coley. If on the initial scheduled expiration date of
the Offer or any extension thereof, any applicable waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act"), any applicable Law of Germany regulating competition, merger
control or exchange controls or any other applicable foreign Laws regulating
competition, antitrust, investment or exchange controls has not expired or
terminated, Acquisition Subsidiary shall, if requested to do so by Coley,
extend the expiration date of the Offer for up to ten (10) business days. In
addition, Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary each agree that if any of the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of _Annex A_ are not satisfied,
including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, on any expiration date of
the Offer, then Acquisition Subsidiary shall, and Acquiror shall, if
requested to do so by Coley, cause Acquisition Subsidiary to, extend the Offer
one time for a period of up to ten (10) business days.

__1.2 _Action by Coley._

(a) Coley hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and
warrants that the  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  Board of Directors of Coley, at a meeting duly called and held, has, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) consented to the making of
the Offer by Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary and the taking of any other
action by Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
hereof, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the Tender Agreement, are fair to,
and in the best interests of, the stockholders of Coley, (iii) approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Offer and
the Merger, in all respects, and that such approval constitutes approval of
the Offer, this Agreement and the Merger for purposes of Section 203 of the
DGCL, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Coley accept the
Offer, tender their Coley Shares to Acquisition Subsidiary and approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , such approval
and recommendation by the Board of Directors of Coley may be withdrawn,
modified, or amended to the extent permitted by Section 5.2. Coley consents to
the inclusion of such approval and recommendation in the Offer Documents,
subject to the foregoing proviso. Coley further represents and warrants that
JPMorgan has delivered to the Board of Directors of Coley its written opinion
dated November 15, 2007, that the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section
2.5(c)) to be received by the stockholders of Coley pursuant to the Offer and
the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders. Coley
has been authorized by JPMorgan to permit the inclusion of the fairness
opinion in the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined in Section 1.2(b)).

(b) Contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer as provided in
Section 1.1, Coley hereby agrees to file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") containing the recommendations described in Section 1.2(a), and to
mail promptly the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of Coley. The Schedule
14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable
federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to Coleys stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that in complying with the foregoing commitments, Coley may
rely on the accuracy of any information provided in writing by Acquiror or
Acquisition Subsidiary for inclusion or incorporation by reference into the
Schedule 14D-9. Coley, Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary each agrees to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and Coley further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the holders of Coley Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. Acquiror and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 prior to filing with the
SEC. In addition, Coley agrees to provide Acquiror and its counsel with a copy
of, and shall consult with Acquiror regarding any telephonic notification of
any oral comments, and shall consult with Acquiror before responding to any
written comments, in each case that Coley or its counsel receives from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the receipt of such comments or other communications. In the event that
Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary receives any comments from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) respond promptly to such comments and (ii) take all
other actions necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

(c) In connection with the Offer, Coley will promptly (but in any event within
three (3) business days after the date hereof) furnish (or cause to be
furnished) to Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary mailing labels, security
position listings and any available listing or computer files containing  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  the names and addresses of the record holders of Coley Shares as of a recent
date and shall furnish Acquisition Subsidiary with such additional
information and assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Acquisition
Subsidiary or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the record and beneficial holders of Coley Shares. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger, Acquiror, Acquisition Subsidiary and
their affiliates, associates, agents, representatives and advisors shall use
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, will deliver to Coley all copies of such information, in whatever
media, then in their possession.

__1.3  _Directors._

(a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer of a
number of Coley Shares that satisfies the Minimum Condition, Acquiror shall
be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors of Coley that equals the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Board of Directors of Coley (giving effect
to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and
(ii) the percentage that the number of Coley Shares beneficially owned by
Acquiror and/or Acquisition Subsidiary (including Coley Shares accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of Coley Shares
outstanding, and Coley shall take all action necessary to cause Acquirors
designees to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of Coley,
including increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting
resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, Coley will also use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause individuals designated by Acquiror to
constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i)
each committee of the Board of Directors of Coley and (ii) each board of
directors of each Coley Subsidiary identified by Acquiror (and each committee
thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Board of Directors of Coley, in each case only to the extent permitted by
applicable Law including the rules of The Nasdaq Global Market or any other
exchange on which the Coley Shares are listed. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that at least two of the members of the Board of Directors
of Coley, who are not officers, employees or affiliates of Coley, Acquiror or
Acquisition Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates,
shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time, be individuals who were
independent directors of Coley (for purposes of the continued listing
requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market) on the date hereof (the "Continuing
Directors"); _provided_ that if there shall be in office fewer than two
Continuing Directors for any reason, the Board of Directors of Coley
shall cause a person designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill
such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes
of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of Coley then in office shall designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or affiliates of
Coley, Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Coley
shall not delegate any matter covered by this Section 1.3 to any committee of
the Board of Directors of Coley, unless such committee consists only of the
Continuing Directors.

(b) Coleys obligations to appoint Acquirors designees to the Board of
Directors of Coley shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Coley shall promptly take all actions, and
shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to Coley and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, so long as Acquiror shall
have provided to Coley on a timely basis in writing and be solely responsible
for any information with respect to itself, Acquisition Subsidiary and their
respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_. __Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition Subsidiary shall be merged with
and into Coley at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3). From and
after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition
Subsidiary shall cease and Coley shall continue as the Surviving Corporation
under the name "Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc." and shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of Acquisition Subsidiary and Coley in
accordance with the DGCL.

2.2 _The Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. on the first business day after all of the conditions
to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger as set forth in
Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived, or on such other mutually
agreeable later date as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver
of all conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in Article VI (the
"Closing Date").

2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties
shall file a certificate of merger substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State, or at such later time as Acquiror, Acquisition
Subsidiary and Coley shall agree should be specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the "Effective Time").

2.4 _Effect of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises and be subject to all of the restrictions, debts, liabilities,
disabilities, obligations and duties of Coley and Acquisition Subsidiary, and
the Merger shall otherwise have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the
DGCL.

2.5 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of the Acquiror, Acquisition
Subsidiary, Coley, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of Coley Shares or
any shares of capital stock of Acquisition Subsidiary:

(a) _Acquisition Subsidiary Common Stock_. Each share of capital stock
of Acquisition Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  | (b) _Cancellation of Stock_. Each Coley Share that is held by Coley (as
treasury stock or otherwise) or held by Acquiror or Acquisition Subsidiary or
by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Coley, Acquiror or
Acquisition Subsidiary, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Coley Shares_. Each Coley Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Coley Shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.5(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined
below)) shall be canceled, extinguished and converted into and become a right
to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Amount in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Coley Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Coley
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Coley Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
held by a holder (if any) who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands,
appraisal for such Coley Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal, if
any. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Coley Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262\. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to appraisal, such
Coley Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.5(c) without any interest thereon. Coley shall give Acquiror prompt
notice of any demands received by Coley for appraisal of Coley Shares, and
Acquiror shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Coley shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Acquiror or as otherwise required by Law, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, nor
shall Coley agree to or commit to making any such payment or settlement or
admit to any liability with respect to such matters.

(e) _Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, Coley shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that each option to purchase Coley
Shares granted under Coleys 1997 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock
Option Plan and its 2005 Stock Plan (in each case, a "Coley Option")
outstanding at the Effective Time which is vested (in each case, a "Vested
Coley Option") shall entitle each holder thereof to receive a payment in cash
from the Surviving Corporation, upon the Effective Time, equal to the product
of (i) the number of Coley Shares previously subject to such Vested Coley
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Coley Share previously subject to such Vested Coley Option.
All applicable withholding taxes attributable to the payments made hereunder
shall be deducted from the amounts payable hereunder; provided, however, that
with respect to any person subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any such
amount shall be paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment can
be made without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act. Coley shall, upon the request of any holder of Vested Coley Options,
permit such holder to execute and deliver to Coley, prior to the expiration of
the Offer, an agreement substantially in the form of _Annex B_ (an "Option
Election") under which such holder would agree,  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  contingent upon the purchase of Coley Shares by Acquisition Subsidiary
pursuant to the Offer, to cause, immediately prior to the expiration of the
Offer, such Vested Coley Options to be exercised and the Coley Shares issued
as a result of that exercise to be tendered in the Offer. Coley and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall reflect on their books and records the
transactions effected pursuant to the Option Elections. At the Effective
Time, (A) each Coley Option (whether vested or not) outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share that is less than
the applicable Merger Consideration for the class of Coley Shares into which
such Coley Option is exercisable shall be cancelled by Coley in exchange for
the right to receive, without interest, a cash amount equal to the product of
(1) the excess, if any, of (x) such Merger Consideration, over (y) the
exercise price per share of such Coley Option multiplied by (2) the total
number of Coley Shares subject to such Coley Option (such product, as applied
to Coley Options referred to as "Option Consideration"); (B) each Coley
Option (whether vested or not) outstanding as of the Effective Time with an
exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the applicable
Merger Consideration for the class of Coley Shares into which such Coley
Option is exercisable shall be terminated, without any consideration
therefor; and (C) the Board of Directors of Coley shall take any actions
necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this Section 2.5(e) under
its 1997 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Option Plan and its 2005
Stock Plan and all Coley Option agreements and any other plan or arrangement
of Coley (whether written or oral, formal or informal). As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, Coley shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
each holder of a Coley Option any certifications, notices or other
communications required by the terms of such Coley Option or any agreement
entered into with respect thereto to be delivered to such holder prior to the
Effective Time and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) _Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time, Coley shall take all steps
necessary to cause all warrants to purchase Coley Shares (the "Coley
Warrants") that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
cancelled, as of the Effective Time, in exchange for the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (x) the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price
per share of such Coley Warrant by (y) the number of Coley Shares subject to
such Coley Warrant (the "Warrant Consideration"). Payment of the Warrant
Consideration shall be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

 __2.6 _Surrender of Securities; Funding of Payments; Stock Transfer Books._

(a) _Exchange Agent_. __As of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Acquiror
and reasonably acceptable to Coley (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates (as defined below) for the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Payment Fund_. __Prior to or upon the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
remit to the Exchange Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration (including the aggregate Merger Consideration for all Dissenting
Shares) necessary to pay the holders of the Certificates representing Coley
Shares (collectively, the "Payment Fund").

(c) _Letter of Transmittal; Procedure for Exchange_. Acquiror agrees that, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to holders of record of
Coley Shares (as of the Effective Time) a form of letter of transmittal and
other appropriate materials and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Coley Shares (each, a
"Certificate") for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay to such holder out of the
Payment Fund, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Coley
Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, less any amounts required to be held pursuant to applicable tax Laws,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of a Certificate for the benefit of the holder thereof. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost or destroyed, the Exchange Agent, subject
to such other conditions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably impose
(including the posting of an indemnity bond or other surety in favor of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to be lost or
destroyed), shall be authorized to accept an affidavit from the record
holder of such Certificate in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, and upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such affidavit,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
pay to the record holder of such Certificate out of the Payment Fund the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Coley Shares represented by
such Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any amounts
required to be held pursuant to applicable tax Laws.

(d) _Payment to Registered Holders_. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such
Certificate shall be surrendered and shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent that such tax
either has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _Stock Transfer Books Closed_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Coley shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of Coley Shares thereafter on the records of Coley.

(f) _No Dividends_. After the Effective Time, no dividends, interest or other
distributions shall be paid to the holder of any Coley Shares.

(g) _No Further Rights_. After the Effective Time, each Certificate shall
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Coley
Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No interest shall be paid on any Merger Consideration payable to former
holders of Coley Shares.

(h) _Termination of Payment Fund_ __. __Promptly following the six-month
anniversary date of the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall return to the
Surviving Corporation all of the remaining Payment Fund, and the Exchange
Agent s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate may
surrender the same to the Surviving Corporation and upon such surrender
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) shall
receive the applicable aggregate Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to
any former holder of Coley Shares for any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent to pay for Coley Shares for which appraisal rights have been
perfected shall be returned to Acquiror, upon demand. If any Certificate
shall not have been  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article II would otherwise escheat or become the property of any Governmental
Entity), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Acquiror, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Acquiror.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Coley Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, _the Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (the "ITA")
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Acquiror, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Coley Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Acquiror.

 

2.7 _Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Coley shall be amended to read in
its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto. The Certificate of
Incorporation of Coley, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time
and, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.9, until thereafter
amended as provided by Law.

2.8 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9, the Bylaws
of Acquisition Subsidiary shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Effective Time of the Merger and until thereafter altered,
amended or repealed as provided by Law.

2.9 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Directors
of Acquisition Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the Directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of Acquisition Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. To the extent
requested by Acquiror, Coley shall cause each director and officer of each
Coley Subsidiary to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her
resignation as a director or officer (but not as an employee of such
Coley Subsidiary), as the case may be, effective upon the Effective Time or,
if specified by Acquiror, the time at which his or her successor has been
appointed.

2.10 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.10(b) and Section 2.10(c) below, Coley grants to
Acquisition Subsidiary an assignable and irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option") to purchase from Coley the number of shares of Coley Common Stock
(the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the number of shares of Coley Common
Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Coley Common Stock owned by
Acquisition Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Coley
Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (assuming the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Coley Common Stock in
excess of the aggregate of the  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  number of shares of Coley Common Stock held as treasury shares by Coley and
any Coley Subsidiaries and the number of shares of Coley Common Stock that
Coley is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that
are not issued and outstanding (and are not reserved for issuance pursuant to
the instruments disclosed pursuant to Section 3.2) as of immediately prior to
the exercise of the Top-Up Option.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Acquisition Subsidiary, in whole or
in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that the obligation of Coley to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the
exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by
Coley, that (A) the issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up
Option would not require approval of Coleys stockholders under applicable Law
(excluding the NASDAQ rules and regulations), (B) immediately following
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Coley Common Stock
owned in the aggregate by Acquiror, the Acquisition Subsidiary and each of
Acquirors direct and indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries constitutes at
least one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Coley Common
Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (assuming the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares) and (C) the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied.
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Law, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Per
Share Amount. Such purchase price may be paid by Acquisition Subsidiary, at
its election, either in cash or by executing and delivering to Coley a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to such purchase price, or by
any combination of cash and such promissory note. Any such promissory note
shall bear interest at the applicable federal rate determined under Section
1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. 

(c) In the event that Acquisition Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, it shall deliver to Coley a notice setting forth (i) the number of
Top-Up Option Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, (ii) the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable exercise
price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares by Acquisition Subsidiary is to take place. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Acquisition Subsidiary
shall cause to be delivered to Coley the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares, and Coley shall cause to
be issued to Acquisition Subsidiary a certificate representing such shares.

(d) Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary acknowledge that the Top-Up Option
Shares that Acquisition Subsidiary may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary represent and warrant to Coley
that Acquisition Subsidiary is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D under the Securities Act. Acquisition Subsidiary agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Acquisition Subsidiary for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

(e) In the event Acquiror delivers notice to Coley that it may exercise the
Top-Up Option, Coley shall promptly amend the Rights Agreement to delete
the requirement that Coley reserve any shares of capital stock of Coley
necessary to satisfy Coleys obligations under the Rights Agreement.

  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  | ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COLEY

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Coley to Acquiror
on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Coley Disclosure Schedule") (it
being agreed that the Coley Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Article III, and the disclosures in any
paragraph of the Coley Disclosure Schedule shall qualify only (i) the numbered
or lettered sections and subsections contained in this Article III referred to
in such paragraph and (ii) other sections and subsections in this Article III
only to the extent it is reasonably and readily apparent from a reading of the
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections), Coley
represents and warrants as follows:

__3.1 _Corporate Organization and Authorization_. __

(a) Coley is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power
to own its property and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Coley has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Coley and the consummation by Coley of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Coley are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the then outstanding Coley Shares, if and to
the extent required by applicable Law, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Coley and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Coley enforceable against
Coley in accordance with its terms.

(b) (i) Coley is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property
owned or leased by it or the nature of the activities conducted by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below).

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means any
change, event, circumstance, development or effect that, individually or in
the aggregate with all other changes, events, circumstances, developments or
effects occurring or existing prior to the determination of a Material Adverse
Effect, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or other), or
results of operations of Coley and any Coley Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(ii) the ability of Coley to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following shall be deemed
either alone or in combination with any of the following to constitute a
Material Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse effect that results from general
economic, business, financial or market conditions (provided that such adverse
effect does not affect Coley and any Coley Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
a disproportionate manner); (B) any adverse effect that results from
conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries (provided that
such adverse effect does not affect Coley and any Coley Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, in a disproportionate manner); (C) any adverse effect resulting from
any act of terrorism, war, national or international  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  calamity or any other similar event (provided that such adverse effect does
not affect Coley and any Coley Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
a disproportionate manner); (D) any changes (after the date hereof) in GAAP;
(E) any loss of customers, suppliers, vendors or employees or any cancellation
of or delay in customer orders resulting from the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
any direct legal or contractual consequence of Coleys execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby); (F) the failure of Coley to meet internal or
analysts expectations or projections, in and of itself; (G) any adverse
effect resulting from any action taken by Coley or any Coley Subsidiaries with
Acquirors prior written consent or the taking of any action expressly
required by this Agreement; (H) a decline in Coleys stock price, in and of
itself; and (I) Coleys continuing to suffer operating losses in amounts
consistent with the losses projected to be suffered by Coley in projections
previously provided or made available to Acquiror by Coley, in and of itself.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material",
"materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower
case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without
regard to the meanings ascribed to Material Adverse Effect in the prior
sentence of this paragraph.

(c) The copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Coley which
are incorporated by reference as exhibits to Coleys Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 are complete and correct copies of
such documents and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, except for the filing of the Certificate of Designation,
Preferences and Rights relating to the Rights Agreement, as filed with the SEC
as an exhibit to Coleys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 2007. Coley has made available to Acquiror true and complete
copies of the minute books of Coley.

__3.2 _Coley Capital Stock_. _ _

(a) The authorized capital stock of Coley consists of (i) 50,000,000 shares of
Coley Common Stock, of which 26,604,496 shares were issued and outstanding,
as of October 26, 2007, and of which no shares are issued and held as treasury
shares and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share,
of which 1,000,000 are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred

outstanding contractual obligations of Coley of any kind to redeem, purchase
or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of Coley. There
are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or
securities of Coley having the right to vote (or, other than the outstanding
Coley Options and Warrants, convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of Coley may
vote. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings with
respect to the voting of capital stock of Coley to which Coley is a party or
of which Coley otherwise has knowledge. There are not any declared but unpaid
dividends or distributions on any capital stock of Coley. Except as set forth
in Section 3.2(b) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule, since October 26, 2007,
Coley has not issued any shares of capital stock, options, warrants or other
securities, other than Coley Shares issuable pursuant to any outstanding
Coley Options or Coley Warrants.

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule lists each outstanding
option, warrant or other right to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from
Coley any capital stock of Coley or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock of Coley, including the name of the holder
thereof, the stock plan under which it was issued, the date of grant and
exercise price thereof, and the vesting schedule thereof (including any
acceleration as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation rights, phantom
stock awards or other rights that are  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  linked in any way to the price of Coley Shares or the value of Coley or any
part thereof. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.2 and Section
3.2(b) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Coley are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding,
and there are no outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which Coley is a party or by which it is bound obligating Coley to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other voting securities of Coley or obligating Coley to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call,
right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking.

"Coley Balance Sheet." Except as reflected in the financial statements
contained in the Coley Public Reports,  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  Coley does not have any liabilities or obligations or any nature (whether

(the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any related rules and regulations promulgated

such certifications are complete and correct.

(e) Coley has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act);
such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Coley required to be disclosed in the Coley Public
Reports, is made known to Coleys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; such disclosure controls and procedures have been
evaluated for effectiveness as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
of the Coleys most recent annual or quarterly report filed with the SEC; and,
to the knowledge of Coley, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting Coleys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in

recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, Coley is not
aware of (i) any significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Coleys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data or any material weaknesses in internal
controls or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Coleys internal controls.

  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  Subsidiaries is a party, or which affect the assets of Coley or any of the
Coley Subsidiaries, except where such suits, actions, proceedings

no suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, claims or orders pending
or threatened against Coley or any Coley Subsidiary related to any Employee
Benefit Plan (other than non-material claims in the ordinary course of
business). No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to any ongoing audit,
investigation, or other administrative proceeding of any Governmental Entity,
and no Employee Benefit Plan is the subject of any pending application for
administrative relief under any voluntary compliance program or closing
agreement program of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor.

(d) All contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan (or to
any person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made if due, and where
not yet due the amount of such payment or contribution obligation has been
reflected in the financial statements of Coley, in accordance with GAAP, as of
the end of Coleys most recent fiscal year preceding the date of this
Agreement, which are publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement.
All such contributions representing participant contributions have been made
within the time required by applicable Law including Department of Labor
regulation section 2510.3-102. All such contributions to, and payments from,
the Employee Benefit Plans, except those payments to be made from a trust
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, for any period ending before the
Closing Date that are not yet, but will be, required to be made, will be
properly accrued and reflected on the financial statements of Coley. All
assets of any Employee Benefit Plan consist of cash or actively traded
securities. There is no Lien on the assets of Coley or an Coley Subsidiary
arising under Section 302(f) or 4068(a) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code
or any successor provisions of ERISA or the Code.

(e) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a), 401(f), or 403(a) of the Code and, to the extent
applicable, Section 401(k) of the Code has received a determination letter,
notification letter or opinion letter on which Coley is entitled to rely from
the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Employee Benefit Plan is
so qualified and exempt from federal income taxes, and no such determination
or opinion letter has been revoked, and no event has occurred and no condition
exists that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary has engaged in a prohibited
transaction, as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA,
as a fiduciary or party in interest with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan,
and to the Knowledge of Coley, no prohibited transaction, within the meaning
of Section 406 or ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. For this purpose, whether a prohibited
transaction exists shall be determined without regard to whether a statutory
or other exemption is applicable.

 

(g) Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary has or has ever had any actual or
potential, secondary, or contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA and no
Employee Benefit Plan is or has ever  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  been subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary
has ever established, maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or been required
to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) or
withdrawn from any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA).

(h) No fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) has engaged in
any transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that could subject
Coley or any Coley Subsidiary to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty
under ERISA or any other applicable Law (whether such liability is directly
against the Coley or the Coley Subsidiary or the result of any existing
indemnity agreements).

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(i) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule,
neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary has offered to provide life, health or
medical benefits or insurance coverage to any individual, or to the family
members of any individual, for any period extending beyond the termination of
the individuals employment, except to the extent required by the COBRA
provisions in ERISA and the Code or similar state benefit continuation laws.
Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such term is
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies in all material respects
with Sections 601 et seq. and 701 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B and
Subtitle K of the Code.

(j) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(j) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in connection with termination of employment, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, independent contractor, director, or officer of
Coley or any Coley Subsidiary to any severance pay, change in control payment,
unemployment compensation, parachute payment or other material payment; (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due, any such employee, independent contractor, director, or
officer; (iii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Employee Benefit Plan; or (iv) entitle any such employee, independent
contractor, director or officer to any gross-up or similar material payment in
respect of the excise tax described in Section 4999 of the Code or other
similar tax.

 

(k) Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary has a formal plan, commitment, or
proposal, whether legally binding or not, nor has Coley or a Coley Subsidiary
made a commitment to any individual to create any additional Employee Benefit
Plan or modify or change any existing Employee Benefit Plan that would affect
any current employee, director or consultant, or former employee, of Coley or
a Coley Subsidiary, or any beneficiary or alternate payee of such an
individual. No events have occurred or are expected to occur with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in the cost of
providing the benefits under such plan or would cause a material change in
the cost of providing for other liabilities of such plan. Coley has the right
to amend or terminate each Employee Benefit Plan without incurring any
liability other than with respect to benefits that have already accrued under
an Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

(l) Any Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been identified as
such on Section 3.13(l) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule. Each such Benefit
Plan has been operated in accordance with the requirements of Code Section
409A and the guidance issued thereunder through and including Notice 2007-86.

(m) Coley does not have and has never had an ERISA Affiliate that is not a
Coley Subsidiary. " _ERISA Affiliate"_ means with respect to an entity (a) a
member of any "controlled group" (as defined in section 414(b) of the Code) of
which an entity is also a member, (b) a trade or business, whether or not
incorporate, under common control (within the meaning of section 414(c) of the
Code) with an entity, or (c) a member of any affiliated service group (within

works council or labor organization, nor is any such contract or agreement
presently being negotiated, nor, to the knowledge of Coley, is there, nor has
there been in the last five years, a representation campaign respecting any of
the employees of Coley or any Coley Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge of
Coley, there are no campaigns being conducted to solicit cards from employees
of Coley or any Coley Subsidiary to authorize representation by any labor
organization. Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary is a party to, or bound
by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any governmental agency relating
to employees or employment practices. Neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary
is the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair
labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization nor, as of the date of this Agreement, is there pending
or, to the knowledge of Coley, threatened, any labor strike, dispute, walkout,
work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Coley or any Coley Subsidiary.

(p) To the knowledge of Coley, neither Coley nor any Coley Subsidiary has
taken any action that, by itself or in conjunction with any action of
equal magnitude that may be taken after the Effective Time, will trigger any
obligations under the WARN Act or any other similar or comparable applicable
Law. As used in the Agreement, "WARN Act" means the Workers Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1989, as amended.

the termination, and (iii) no employee is on disability or other leave of

and effect; and neither Coley nor any of the Coley Subsidiaries has received
any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any
such Governmental Licenses, which, singly or in the aggregate, if the

Subsidiary as reflected on Section 3.16(h) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule),
except as indicated on Section 3.16(a) of the Coley Disclosure Schedule. To

5.2 _Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation._

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, Coley shall not, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, agents and
other advisors or representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations
with or provide any information to any Person o (other than Acquiror or an
affiliate or an associate of Acquiror) concerning any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below) or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal
or enter into any agreement, agreement-in-principle or letter of intent with
respect to or accept any Acquisition Proposal (or resolve to or publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing) or (iii) otherwise take any action to
assist or facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Coley may (A) refer any party to this Section 5.2, (B) under
circumstances in which Coley has complied with all of its obligations under
this Section 5.2(a), in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal,
furnish information and access, in response to unsolicited requests therefor,
to any Person, and to any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by such party, and may participate
in discussions and negotiations concerning such Acquisition Proposal if the
Board of Directors of Coley determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and receiving the advice of its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
(as defined below); provided that prior to such provision of information or
access or conduct of such additional discussions (I) such third party shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement in customary form that is no
less favorable to Coley than the Confidentiality Agreement (and containing
additional provisions that expressly permit Coley to comply with its
disclosure obligations under this Agreement), a copy of which shall be
provided promptly after its execution to Acquiror, (II) the Board of Directors
of Coley shall have determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation
with and after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(III) Coley has provided Acquiror at least three (3) business days prior
written notice, and (C) to the extent applicable, comply with Rule 14d-9 or
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal if in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Coley
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided that the
Board of Directors of Coley shall not recommend that the stockholders of
Coley tender their Coley Shares in connection with any tender offer or
exchange offer unless the Board of Directors of Coley determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and advice from its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal. Coley shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall
cause its affiliates and its or their respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, agents and other advisors and
representatives, to terminate all existing discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and will cause
any such parties (and their agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information regarding Coley to return or destroy such information, and shall
notify any such Person that Coley is no longer seeking the making of any
Acquisition Proposal from such Person and withdraws any request or consent
theretofore  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  given for the making of an Acquisition Proposal. Coley shall ensure that its
officers, directors and key employees and its investment bankers, attorneys
and other representatives are aware of the provisions of this Section 5.2.

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement,

i. "Acquisition Proposal" means (A) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale or license of substantial assets or
technology, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other business
combination involving Coley or any Coley Subsidiary, (B) any proposal for the
issuance by Coley or any Coley Subsidiary of over 10% of its equity
securities, or (C) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, over 10% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of
Coley, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

ii. "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to
effect a merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, direct or indirect business combination, or
other similar transaction as a result of which Coley stockholders cease to own
at least 50% of the voting securities of the ultimate parent entity resulting
from such transaction or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Coley, having terms that the Board of Directors of Coley determines in its
good faith judgment, after having received the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, taking into
account all relevant factors, including any conditions to such Acquisition
Proposal, the timing of the closing thereof, the risk of nonconsummation,
the ability of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal to finance the
transaction contemplated thereby, and any required governmental or other
consents, filings and approvals, (A) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to Coleys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the terms of any proposal by Acquiror to modify the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and (B) is reasonably likely to be financed
and otherwise completed without undue delay.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of Coley set forth in this Section
5.2, Coley shall immediately advise Acquiror orally and in writing of any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry with respect to or which could result in an Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and any subsequent changes to such material terms and conditions
(including copies of all correspondence and written materials received in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry by Acquiror or any officer,
director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative of Coley), and the identity of the Person making the same.
Coley shall inform Acquiror on a prompt and current basis of the status and
content of any discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal with a third
party and as promptly as practicable of any change in the price, structure or
form of the consideration or material terms of and conditions regarding the
Acquisition Proposal or of any other developments or circumstances which could
reasonably be expected to culminate in the taking of any of the actions
referred to on Section 5.2(a) or Section 7.1(g). Coley shall promptly provide
to Acquiror any non public information regarding Coley provided to any other
Person which was not previously provided to Acquiror, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other Person. Coley shall not release any Person from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
Coley is a party unless the Board of Directors of Coley determines in good
faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal
counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  | _5.3 Meetings of Stockholders; Proxy Statement_. __

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, except as
set forth below, Coley shall take all necessary action to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
stockholders as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer
for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Stockholders Meeting"). If the
Stockholders Meeting is required by applicable Law in order to consummate the
Merger, Coley shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
the stockholders of Coley proxies in favor of the Merger and take all actions
reasonably necessary to secure the approval of such stockholders under
applicable Law. At the Stockholders Meeting, if such Stockholders Meeting is
required, Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary shall cause all Coley Shares
then owned by them and their subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In the event a Stockholders Meeting is called, Coley will prepare and
file with the SEC a Proxy Statement for the solicitation of a vote of holders
of Coley Shares approving the Merger, which Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Coley that stockholders of Coley
vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the above, the Board of Directors of Coley may withdraw, modify or amend its
approval and recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Stockholders Meeting, and
may determine not to include its recommendation of the Merger and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the Proxy Statement, if
the Board of Directors of Coley determines, in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and receiving the advice of its financial advisors and
legal counsel, that it has received a Superior Proposal and that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicble Law.
However, whether or not the Board of Directors of Coley has withdrawn,
modified or amended its approval and recommendation or included its
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herby in the Proxy Statement, Coley shall still take all actions
set forth in Sections 5.3(a) and (c) and prepare and file with the SEC a
Proxy Statement for the solicitation of a vote of holders of Coley Shares
approving the Merger.

(c) If required by applicable Law, as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer, Coley shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC
under the Exchange Act, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. Acquiror, Acquisition Subsidiary
and Coley shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, if required, and Coley shall notify Acquiror of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, if required, and
of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Acquiror promptly copies of all
correspondence between Coley or any representative of Coley and the SEC.
Coley shall give Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement, if required, prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give
Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and
supplements to the Proxy Statement, if required, and all responses to requests
for additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed
with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of Coley, Acquiror and Acquisition Subsidiary
agrees to use its reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other
parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by
the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement, if required, and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Coley
Shares entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting, if required, at the
earliest practicable time. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
will be made by Coley without the approval of Acquiror, which will not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement reflecting actions taken by
the Board of Directors of Coley to comply with its  



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Agreement and Plan of Merger |  |  |  |  fiduciary duties shall not require the approval of Acquiror. If necessary,
after the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, Coley shall
promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and,
if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies.

_5.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality_. __

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the agreements set forth in Section 5.4(b),

facilities, books and records, officers and employees, (ii) permit Acquiror to
make such reasonable inspections of such material facilities, books and
records, and (iii) cause its officers and those of the Coley Subsidiaries
to furnish Acquiror with access to such material financial and operating data
and other information with respect to the business and assets of Coley and the
Coley Subsidiaries as Acquiror may from time to time reasonably request. No

warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies

ratified and affirmed by the parties hereto.

5.5 _HSR Act and Foreign Competition Laws_. __Acquiror and Coley shall
promptly, and in any case within ten (10) business days following the date

applicable foreign competition Laws with respect to the Offer, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings. Acquiror and Coley shall use

authorizations, consents, expiration or termination of waiting periods, and
approvals from third parties and any Governmental Entity necessary to

in effect at its most recent fiscal year end, except as required by changes
in generally accepted accounting principles as concurred by its independent
accountants.

before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable
Law or requirements of any exchange upon which the Coley Shares or shares of
Acquiror or any of its affiliates are traded. The parties shall issue a
joint press release, mutually acceptable to Acquiror and Coley, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

fiduciary capacity of any Employee Benefit Plan) of Coley and Coley
Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, expenses, claims,
damages, liabilities or amounts arising out of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law and Coleys certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
on the date hereof or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on
the date hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the date of the
Effective Time.

(b) Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, until the six-year
anniversary date of the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation
agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor
of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective charters or by-laws,
by contract, or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, and Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to keep in effect all such indemnification and
exculpation provisions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for such
six-year period after the Effective Time, except as required by applicable

the exculpation or rights of indemnification thereunder.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
maintain in effect or Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Corporation with Acquirors authorization shall cause to be

less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which

necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Acquiror and Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such

substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at
Acquirors option, Acquiror, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9.
