(b) Cancellation of Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, each share of
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Common Stock not represented by certificates ("Book
Entry Shares") and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock
("Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except

Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Common
Stock owned or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or its

vested or unvested) under a Company Equity Plan (an "Option") shall be
cancelled and all rights with respect thereto shall cease to exist, and, in
consideration for the cancellation of such Option, the holder of any such
Option (if the Merger Consideration is greater than the exercise price
per share of the Common Stock of such Option) will be entitled to receive,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, an amount equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Option held by
the holder of the Option, and (y) the excess of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to the Option as set
forth in such Option (the amount in clause (y) divided by the number in
clause (x) above, the "Per Share Option Consideration") (all such Options to
which the amount calculated in this sentence is a positive number, the

Option in respect of its termination if the amount calculated in the

EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT

 

 

Section 3.1 Exchange Agent; Payment Funds.

 

 

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent

 

 

. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
as is approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) as exchange and paying agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
exchange and payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(b) Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Common Stock, an amount in cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant
to Section 3.2 assuming no Dissenting Shares. Any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Common Stock
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

 

 

(c) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that any
such investments shall be in money market mutual or similar funds having
assets in excess of $10,000,000,000. Earnings on the Exchange Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No
investment or loss of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required
by this Article III, and following any losses from any such investment,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of
the Exchange Fund.

 

 

 

Section 3.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book Entry Shares whose
shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.6 (A) a letter of transmittal and instructions, the form and
substance of which shall be substantially as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the
Closing (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss with respect to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent, and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall then be canceled.

 

 

(c) No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made with respect to
such Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing such shares of Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that all applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

. The Merger Consideration paid upon conversion of each share of Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of Article II and this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Common Stock. Subject to Section 3.6, if any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares would
otherwise escheat to or become the property or any Governmental Entity), any
such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. If, after the Effective Time, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing shares of Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article III.

 

 

 

Section 3.4 Termination of Exchange Fund

 

 

. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Common Stock formerly
represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
2.6 and Section 3.2.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 3.5 No Liability

 

 

. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

Section 3.6 Lost Certificates

 

 

. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the provision of an indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the aggregate
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

 

 

Section 3.7 Stock Transfer Books

 

 

. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the terms hereof. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares presented with a Letter of Transmittal to
the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be exchanged for the
aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

 

 

Section 3.8 Shares of Dissenting Shareholders

 

 

. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who
has properly demanded that the Company purchase such shares in accordance
with Chapter 13 of the CCC ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
or exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holder's rights as a holder of Dissenting Shares
under the CCC. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by Chapter 13 of the CCC. If any holder of Dissenting
Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) his or her right to dissent under Chapter 13 of the CCC at or
prior to the Effective Time, each such share of Common Stock of such holder
shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right
to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such
right to demand of payment has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6 and Section 3.2. The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for payment of any
Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC.

referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.4(a).

(or publicly propose that the Company enter into) any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other similar agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or authorize, approve or
publicly recommend or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (or resolve or authorize or propose to agree to do any
of the foregoing actions), except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.4(a).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of the principal terms
of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders
Meeting, (A) if in response to the receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal
which causes the Company Board or the Strategic Committee to determine in
good faith (x) after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with its
outside counsel, that failure to take any of the following actions would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company shareholders under applicable Law to continue to recommend the
Merger, then the Company Board or the Strategic Committee may approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal and, in connection with the approval or
recommendation of such Superior Proposal, make a Change of Recommendation
and/or terminate this Agreement (and subject to Article VIII, in connection
with such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal);
and (B) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company
Board or the Strategic Committee determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, in response to a material development
occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that was neither known
to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date of
this Agreement (such material development, an "Intervening Event"), that its
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company shareholders under applicable
Law, then the Company Board or the Strategic Committee may make a Change of
Recommendation; provided, however, that the Company Board or the Strategic
Committee may not take any actions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence unless the following conditions have been met:

 

 

(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with, and the
Acquisition Proposal was not a result of a breach by the Company of,
Section 6.4;

 

 

(ii) the Company Board or the Strategic Committee shall have first provided
prior written notice to Parent (A) that it is prepared to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal and/or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, which notice shall attach the most current version of any proposed
written agreements relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal
and shall promptly notify Parent of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, or (B) that it is prepared to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to an Intervening Event, including a brief description of the
material development giving rise to such Intervening Event;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Parent and its Representatives shall have had through 11:59 pm
California time on the third Business Day following receipt of such notice
from the Company (or longer period if extended by the mutual agreement of the
Company and Parent) (the "Notice Period") to make a proposal (if Parent
desires) to modify the terms of this Agreement in response to such Superior
Proposal or Intervening Event;

 

 

(iv) following receipt of any such proposal with respect to such
modifications to the terms of this Agreement by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith during the Notice Period
with Parent and its Representatives (if Parent desires to so negotiate) to
make such modifications to the terms of this Agreement as would make the
relevant Acquisition Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal or in a manner
that obviates the need for taking such action as a result of an Intervening
Event;

 

 

(v) after the Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives to make such modifications to the
terms of this Agreement as would make the relevant Acquisition Proposal no
longer a Superior Proposal or in a manner that obviates the need for taking
such action as a result of an Intervening Event, the Strategic Committee
shall have again determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and after taking into account
any such modifications proposed by Parent, that failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company shareholders under applicable Law to continue
to recommend the Merger; and

 

 

(vi) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have paid the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(ii), prior to, and as a condition
of, the termination of this Agreement.

 

 

The Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice in the event of
any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, in which event a new Notice
Period shall commence following receipt of such new written notice
by Parent.

 

 

(c) Notices to Parent. The Company shall as promptly as possible (but in
any event within one Business Day) provide notice to Parent of receipt by
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry with respect to, or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with, any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and shall keep Parent informed on a current
basis of the status thereof and of any material communications, material
modifications or material developments with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request, including, without limitation, copies of all
Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will
not enter into a confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e 2(a), Rule 14d 9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law,
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a
violation of applicable Law and any such disclosure which would otherwise
constitute a Change of Recommendation shall not be deemed to constitute such
a Change of Recommendation for the purposes of Section 6.4(b) if the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms its approval and recommendation of this
Agreement in such communication. In addition, it is understood and agreed
that, for purposes of this Section 6.4(d), a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
and contains a "stop look and listen" communication shall not constitute a
Change of Recommendation for the purposes of Section 6.4(b).

 

 

Section 6.5 Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide each of the
Employees with base salary or wage rates and incentive compensation
opportunities and other cash compensation and benefits that are in line with
current market rates for similar employment positions and. Parent
further intends to supplement such compensation and benefits with performance
incentive programs. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.5(a) does not
guarantee any Employee employment with the Company at any time after
the Effective Time except as may be set forth in any written contract with
the Company.

 

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all written employment contracts and other
compensation agreements with any Employee, in each case existing immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement and as that are disclosed on
Schedule 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(c) Parent shall treat, and shall cause each benefit plan, program, practice,
policy and arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) or Affiliates following the Effective Time and in
which any of the Employees participate or are eligible to participate (the
"Parent Plans") to treat, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not for
accrual of benefits under any "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA) and all other purposes, all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any
Company Benefit Plan provides past service credit) as service with Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause each Parent Plan that is a
welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to
waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived,
satisfied or not included under the corresponding Benefit Plan, and (ii) to
recognize for each Employee for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Plan any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Employee and his or her spouse
and dependents under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan during the calendar
year in which occurs the later of the Effective Time and the date on which
the Employee begins participation in such Parent Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall confer any rights or remedies of any
kind or description upon any of the Employees, or their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Section 6.5 shall constitute an amendment to
any Company Benefits Plan.

 

 

Section 6.6 Publicity

 

 

. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to Parent and
the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their
respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as
may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements;
provided that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior
agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release
or public announcement related to the matters described in Section 6.4,
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2.

 

 

Section 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

 

 

(a) The Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification
than are set forth in Article V of the articles of incorporation of the
Company, and Article X of the by-laws of the Company, respectively, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director and officer of
the Company and each Subsidiary (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (collectively, "Action"), arising
out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as
an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent, whether occurring on or
before the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the CCC for
directors and officers of California corporations (including the requirement
that such Indemnified Party acted in good faith and in a manner such
Indemnified Party reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such Indemnified Party\'s
conduct was unlawful), for a period of six years after the Effective Time. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i)
each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable Law, to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten
Business Days of receipt by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

extent then required by the CCC, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification, (ii) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an
Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could
be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in
the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
the Surviving Corporation's written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided further that, in the event
that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue
until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party
under this Section 6.7(b) shall be in addition to any rights such person may
have under the Organizational Documents of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained at the Effective
Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years
from the Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing
policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to
the Effective Time as described in Section 6.7(b); provided, however, that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to
this Section 6.7(c) more than a one-time premium payment of no more than 200%
of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance;
provided, however, that if the cost of the "tail" policy exceeds 200% of the
current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance, the Surviving
Corporation will obtain such "tail" policy in such amount and scope as can be
obtained for 200% of the current annual premium.

 

 

(d) This Section 6.7 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries any of their officers, directors or employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.7 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
such policies.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.8 Proxy Statement.

 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary
Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement shall comply as to form and content in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the federal securities Laws. Each of the Company
and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates
that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily
included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.4(b), the Company,
acting through the Company Board, shall include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Company Board that the shareholders of the Company vote
in favor of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement (the
"Company Recommendation"). The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the Proxy
Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto), and all responses
to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the
staff of the SEC, prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC,
and Parent and the Company will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.

 

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

 

 

Section 6.9 Shareholders Meeting.

 

 

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the Company's
Organizational Documents and the rules of The Nasdaq Global Market promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable
the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting
upon the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.4(b), (i) the Company
Board shall make the Company Recommendation and include such
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company Board shall
not withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, and (iii) the Company shall take all
action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its shareholders
proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other
action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
shareholders of the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq Global Market
or the CCC to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, with the mutual agreement of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

Parent may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company's shareholders or, if as of the time for
which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 

 

 

(b) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1, (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit in any way the
obligation of the Company to convene and hold the Company Shareholders
Meeting in accordance with Section 6.9(a) of this Agreement, and (ii) the
Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition
Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.10 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities or any other third
parties any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals,
permits or orders required to be obtained by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that in connection therewith,
without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries will make or agree to make
any material payment or accept any material conditions or obligations,
including amendments to existing conditions and obligations; (iii) promptly
make all necessary registrations and filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act
and any applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions
other than the United States, and (C) any other applicable Law; provided,
however, that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing party;
(iv) furnish all information required for any application or other filing to
be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party informed in all
material respects of any material communication received by such party from,
or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any material communication
delivered to, and consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or
conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any proceeding by a
private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; (vii) avoid
the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (viii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No parties to this Agreement shall consent to
any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section
6.10(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and responsibilities
under Section 6.10(b). The provisions of this Section 6.10(a) shall not
apply to the matters described in Section 5.9 and Section 6.17.

 

 

 

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best
efforts to prepare, as promptly as practicable and within the applicable
regulatory deadlines, any required merger notifications or obtain any
government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act and
any other federal, state or foreign Law designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization,
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition
(collectively "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for
information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to seek to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law (an
"Antitrust Order"). The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, subject to
applicable privileges including attorney-client and attorney work product
privileges, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the
Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of its Affiliates (or any of their respective
subsidiaries) nor (unless such action is conditioned upon the Closing) the
Company or any of its Affiliates, shall, under this Section 6.10(b),
be required to (i) effect any sale, divestiture or disposition of existing
or acquired assets or businesses, or (ii) take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation that (A) adversely affects any of the
Parent's, Merger Sub's, the Company's and any of its Subsidiaries' or any of
their Affiliates' businesses, or (B) would have a materially adverse effect
on any material benefit Parent or the Company or its stockholders seek to
receive from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Company, Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be
under any obligation to take any action under this Section 6.10(a) or (b) if
the United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal
Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary injunction or
restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger.

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.12 Takeover Laws

 

 

. If any takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties
and their respective boards of directors shall (a) take all necessary action
to ensure that such transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such takeover Law.

 

 

Section 6.13 Notification of Certain Matters

 

 

. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Merger Sub, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in a manner that
would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a),
as applicable, not to be satisfied, in each case at any time during the Pre-
Closing Period, or (b) any failure of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement in a
manner that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) or Section
7.3(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the Merger.

 

 

Section 6.14 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16

 

 

. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all such steps as may be
reasonably required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) which will result
from the transactions contemplated by Articles II and III of this Agreement
by each officer or director who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

 

Section 6.15 Resignations

 

 

. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Merger Sub at the Closing
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Merger Sub of the resignation, effective
as of the Effective Time, of all directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (except those designated by Merger Sub to the Company in writing
prior to the Closing).

 

 

Section 6.16 Existing Standstill Agreements

 

 

. Except as provided in Section 6.4, the Company shall enforce all standstill
or similar agreements under confidentiality agreements or executed by third-
parties in connection therewith that have been signed prior to the date
hereof and are still currently in effect.

be true and correct as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date) except where the failure of such

TERMINATION

 

 

Section 8.1 Termination

 

 

. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated herein may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
Company Shareholder Approval of the Company Voting Proposal, by written
notice by the terminating party to the other party specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected:

 

 

(a) by the mutual consent of the Company and Parent;

 

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to the five month
anniversary of the date hereof (the "Termination Date"); provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of
the Merger to occur on or prior to the Termination Date;

 

 

(ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action, in each case permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger substantially as contemplated by this Agreement,
and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
non appealable; or

 

 

(iii) if the Company Shareholders Meeting shall have concluded without the
Company Shareholder Approval of the Company Voting Proposal having been
obtained in accordance with the CCC.

 

 

(c) by the Company:

 

 

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
shall be untrue, in any case such that the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of
such determination is the Closing Date); provided that if such breach is
curable by Parent and Merger Sub through the exercise of their reasonable
best efforts and Parent and Merger Sub continue to exercise such reasonable
best efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(c)(i); or

 

 

(ii) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, under the circumstances and
to the extent permitted, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
6.4(b) and provided that the Termination Fee referenced in Section
8.3(b)(ii) shall have been paid by the Company to such Person or Person(s) as

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) by Parent:

 

 

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue, in any case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section
7.2(b) would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination
is the Closing Date); provided that if such breach is curable by the Company
through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts and the Company continues
to exercise such reasonable best efforts, Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(d)(i); or

 

 

(ii) if (A) the Company Board shall have failed to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation, (B) the Company Board shall have approved or recommended, or
proposed publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement other than this Agreement, and/or permitted the Company to enter
into an Alrenative Acquisition Agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal,
(C) the Company shall have failed to call the Company Shareholders Meeting in
accordance with Section 6.9 or shall have failed to deliver the Proxy
Statement in accordance with Section 6.8 in material breach of such Sections
and such failure shall not be due to any material breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of their obligations under Section 6.8(b), or (D) a tender offer or
exchange offer for outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been
commenced (other than by Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates)
and the Company Board recommends that the shareholders of the Company tender
their shares in such tender or exchange offer or within ten Business Days
after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board
fails to recommend rejection (or subsequently modifies a recommendation of
rejection) of such offer.

 

 

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination

 

 

. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability
under this Agreement on the part of any party hereto except (i) as provided
in Section 8.3, and (ii) each party will be fully liable for any liabilities
incurred or direct damages actually suffered (excluding any indirect,
punitive, consequential, special or incidental damages) and incurred by the
other parties as a result of such first party's willful failure to perform
its covenants or willful breach of its representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
Section 6.3(b), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX shall survive
any such termination).

 

 

Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.

 

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 8.3(c), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby are consummated;
provided, however, that the fees and expenses incurred in connection with or
related to (x) the preparation, printing, filing and mailing (excluding legal
and accounting fees and expenses)) of the Proxy Statement shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Company, and (y) any required merger notifications
or obtaining any governmental clearances or approvals required for Closing
under any Antitrust Laws (including the HSR Act), shall be borne equally by
Parent and the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company shall pay to such Person or Person(s) as shall be designated
in writing by Parent the Termination Fee, if:

 

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii);

 

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); or

 

 

(iii) if (A) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) (provided, that the Termination Fee shall not be payable if
Parent's or Merger Sub's failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure of the Merger to occur on
or prior to the Termination Date), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(i)
and (y) at any time after the date hereof and prior to such termination (1)
any Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or
publicly disclosed or (2) any Person actively makes a non-exempt
"solicitation" under Rule 14a-1(l) of the Exchange Act in opposition to the
adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, and (B) within
12 months after any such termination, the Company Board shall have
recommended or the Company or any of its Affiliates consummates, or becomes a
party to, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to,
any Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
that was made or publicly disclosed prior to the Company Meeting).

 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" shall mean $9,600,000 The
Termination Fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be paid by the Company to
Parent, or such Person or Person as shall be designated in writing by Parent,
by wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days following
termination of this Agreement. The Termination Fee due under Section
8.3(b)(ii) shall be paid by the Company to Parent, or such Person or Person
as shall be designated in writing by Parent, immediately prior to termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii). The Termination Fee due
under Section 8.3(b)(iii) shall be paid to Parent, or such Person or Person
as shall be designated in writing by Parent, by wire transfer of same-day
funds within two Business Days following the recommendation of the Company
Board to enter into, or the actual entry into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement or, in the absence thereof, the consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal, as applicable.

 

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances
described in Section 8.3(b)(iii)(A) (provided, that the requirements of
clause (y) of Section 8.3(b)(iii)(A) shall be disregarded for this purpose in
the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)),
then the Company shall pay to Parent, within three Business Days of such
termination, an amount equal to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including, all legal, accounting, financial and tax,
environmental, appraisals, insurance and benefits, consulting and
expert opinions, background investigations, technology, travel expenses and
other expenses such as research, telecommunications charges, photocopying,
delivery and postage) incurred by Parent and Merger Sub after the date hereof
in connection with the investigation, negotiation, documentation and closing
of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

the Merger up to a maximum of $2,000,000, as such amount may be increased by
mutual agreement of Parent and the Company Board (the "Parent Expenses")
(provided, that in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii), the phrase "after the date hereof" in the definition of "Parent
Expenses" shall be ignored for this purpose only); provided, however,
the existence of circumstances that could require the Termination Fee to
become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) or Section 8.3(a); provided, further,
however, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this
Section 8.3(c) or Section 8.3(a) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
(but the Company shall be entitled to deduct from the Termination Fee payable
the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to this
Section 8.3(c) or Section 8.3(a)).

 

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 8.3, the references to "10%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

 

(e) If the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable to the other
under this Section 8.3 within the specified times for any such payment, then
(i) then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in
connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by
Parent of its rights under this Section 8.3, and (ii) the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of
the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on
the date such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum
equal to 3% over the "prime rate" (as announced by The Wall Street Journal)
in effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

 

 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Payment of the Termination Fee described in Section 8.3(b)
shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this
Agreement described in clause (ii) of Section 8.2, but is otherwise the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated. For the
avoidance of doubt, other than as provided in clause (ii) of Section 8.2,
the maximum aggregate liability of the Company shall be limited to an amount
equal to the Termination Fee, plus any amounts that become due under
Section 8.3(f), and in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates seek (i) any damages in excess of such amounts,
(ii) any damages in any amount if the Termination Fee has been paid or (iii)
any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including equitable
relief or consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company
or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.
