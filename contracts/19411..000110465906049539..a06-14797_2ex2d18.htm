(i) If, determined as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_, the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted

exceeds $12,000,000 and the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 exceeds
$30,000,000, then the Company Unitholders immediately before the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, an additional amount
equal to the sum of (A) the product of 0.75 multiplied by the amount by which
the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for the period from July 1, 2006 through
December 31, 2006 exceeds $12,000,000 plus (B) the product of 5.0 multiplied
by the amount by which the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 exceeds
$30,000,000; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the aggregate amount

First Earn-out Distribution Date or the Second Earn-out Distribution Date,
as applicable, by the Unitholder Representative by notice given to Parent,
subject to approval by Parent of such revised percentages ( _and provided,
however,_ that no Company Unitholder who held Class B Units of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time shall then be allocated a portion of
the aggregate Earn-Out Consideration which is less than his respective Target
Percentage Interest). The percentages in which payments of Earn-out
Consideration are to be paid to Company Unitholders are hereinafter referred
to as their " **Earn-out Percentages**." Such Earn-out

     

   

Consideration shall be payable on the First Earn-out Distribution Date to
each such Company Unitholder 33% in cash and 67% in Parent Shares, for which
purpose Parent Shares shall be considered to have a value equal to the Fair
Market Value of the Parent Shares on the First Earn-out Distribution Date,
but such Parent Shares to be subject to the restrictions provided by _Section
2.1(e)_.

  

(ii) If the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for the period from July 1, 2006
through December 31, 2006 fails to exceed $12,000,000 but the CompanyÂ’s
Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 exceeds $30,000,000, then the Company Unitholders
immediately before the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive in the
aggregate, an additional amount equal to the product of 5.0 multiplied by the
amount by which the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for the period from July 1,
2006 through December 31, 2007 exceeds $42,000,000; _provided, however,_

restrictions provided by _Section 2.1(e)_.

  

(iii) In addition, if the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2008 exceeds
$45,000,000, then the Company Unitholders immediately before the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, an additional amount
equal to the product of 2.38 multiplied by the amount by which the CompanyÂ’s
Adjusted EBITDA for 2008 exceeds $45,000,000; _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall the aggregate amount to be so received by Company Unitholders
under this paragraph (iii) exceed $50,000,000. Such Earn-out Consideration
shall be divided among the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
Earn-out Percentages as in effect at the time for such payment. Such Earn-
out Consideration shall be payable on the Second Earn-out Distribution Date

which purpose Parent Shares shall be considered to have a value equal to the
Fair Market Value of the Parent Shares on the Second Earn-out Distribution
Date, but such Parent Shares to be subject to the restrictions provided by
_Section 2.1(e)_.

  

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(c), a
Company Unitholder immediately before the Effective Time (1) shall only be
entitled to receive any Earn-out Consideration on the First Earn-out
Distribution Date if such Company Unitholder on such date is, and at all
times from the Closing Date to the First-Earn-out Distribution Date was, an
Employee in Good Standing of the Parent or a Subsidiary and (2) shall only be
entitled to receive any Earn-out Consideration on the Second Earn-out
Distribution Date, if such Company Unitholder on such date is, and at all
times from the Closing Date to

     

   

the Second Earn-out Distribution Date was, an Employee in Good Standing of
the Parent or a Subsidiary. A Company Unitholder shall be considered an "
**Employee in Good Standing** " of the Parent or a Subsidiary from the
Closing through the First Earn-out Distribution Date or the Second Earn-
out Distribution Date, as the case may be, if such Company Unitholder (1)
continued in the employ of the Company following the Closing to such date

his employment pursuant to such agreement terminated or lapsed after the
Closing Date and before such date for a "Qualifying Reason" as provided by

any other Subsidiary of the Parent other than the Company pursuant to an
employment agreement providing that he or she will be considered an Employee
in Good Standing of the Parent or a Subsidiary during such employment.

  

(v) It is understood and agreed that by reason of a forfeiture of Parent
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(e) _and / or a reallocation of
Additional Parent Shares as provided by _Section 2.1(e)_, a Company
Unitholder may ultimately retain a smaller portion, or receive a larger
portion, of the Earn-out Consideration than its Earn-out Percentage of the
aggregate Earn-out Consideration.

Agreement ,the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for the periods referred to in
_Section 2.1(c) _shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of

shall be permitted until the first anniversary of the First Earn-out
Distribution Date, after which time up to one-half of such Parent Shares may
be Transferred, and no Transfer of the remainder of such Parent Shares shall
be permitted until the second anniversary of the First Earn-out Distribution
Date, after which time all of such Parent Shares may be Transferred, and (2)
in the event at any time before the date such shares become Transferable, as
provided in clause (1) of this sentence, such Company Unitholder shall cease
to be an Employee in Good Standing of the Parent or a Subsidiary thereof,
such Company Unitholder shall immediately, except as otherwise provided by
the last sentence of this _Section 2.1(e),_ as of such time, forfeit such
Parent Shares to the Acquiring Corp. and shall deliver any certificates
representing such shares, duly endorsed for transfer, to the Acquiring Corp.
for no consideration. Any Parent Shares issued to a Company Unitholder as
Earn-out Consideration pursuant to paragraph (iii) of _Section 2.3(c)
_shall be restricted as follows: (1) except as otherwise provided by the
last sentence of this _Section 2.1(e), _without the prior written consent of
the Parent (executed by an executive officer thereof), no Transfer of any of
such Parent Shares shall be permitted until the first anniversary of the
Second Earn-out Distribution Date, after which time up to one-half of such
Shares may be Transferred, and no Transfer of the remainder of such Parent
Shares shall be permitted until the second anniversary of the Second Earn-out
Distribution Date, after

     

   

which time all of such Parent Shares may be Transferred, and (2) in the event
at any time before the date such shares become Transferable, as provided in
clause (1) of this sentence, such Company Unitholder shall cease to be an
Employee in Good Standing of the Parent or a Subsidiary thereof, such Company
Unitholder shall immediately, except as otherwise provided by the last
sentence of this _Section 2.1(e),_ as of such time, forfeit such Parent
Shares to the Acquiring Corp. and shall deliver any certificates representing
such Shares, duly endorsed for transfer, to the Acquiring Corp., for no
consideration  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.1(e)_, if and to the extent a Company Unitholder has in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c) _been so issued a number of Parent Shares as part of the
Earn-out Consideration which is in excess of his Target Percentage of all
Parent Shares so issued as Earn-out Consideration (such shares in the case of
such Company Unitholder, " **Additional Parent Shares** "), then (1) if Raju
Mantena ceases to be an Employee in Good Standing before the date on which
such Additional Parent Shares become Transferable, all such Company
Unitholders shall forfeit such Additional Shares to the Acquiring Corp.,
which Shares may (but need not) be reallocated among the Company Unitholders
who continue to be Employees in Good Standing, in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Acquiring Corp. and (2) if the foregoing clause (1) is not
applicable at the time, then if such a Company Unitholder ceases to be an
Employee in Good Standing before the date on which such Additional Parent
Shares become Transferable, such Company Unitholder shall forfeit such
Additional Parent Shares to the Unitholder Representative, as agent for the
Company Unitholders who continue to be Employees in Good Standing of Parent
or a Subsidiary thereof (instead of to the Acquiring Corp.), and in either
such case such Company Unitholder shall deliver any _ certificates
representing such_ Additional Parent Shares that are to be forfeited _, duly
endorsed for transfer, to the Acquiring Corp. or the_
Unitholder Representative, as the case may be, for no consideration. Within
90 days after such a forfeiture of Additional Parent Shares to the Unitholder
Representative, the Unitholder Representative may reallocate and transfer
such forfeited Additional Parent Shares to Company Unitholders who continue
to be at such time Employees in Good Standing of the Parent or a Subsidiary
thereof (including the Unitholder Representative) as the Unitholder
Representative determines to be appropriate after consultation with Parent;
it being understood that the Unitholder Representative will not reallocate
such Parent Shares in a manner to which Parent reasonably objects. Any such
reallocation of Parent Shares among Company Unitholders shall be reflected in
an amended notice signed by the Unitholder Representative and delivered to
Parent and any Additional Parent Shares so reallocated shall remain in the
hands of the Company Unitholder to whom they are reallocated subject to the
same restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provided hereby as if such
Additional Parent Shares had originally been issued to such Company
Unitholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.1(e)_, (1) such Parent Shares shall be Transferable (A) in the event of the
holderÂ’s death, by will or the laws of descent and distribution or by a
written beneficiary designation accepted by Parent, (B) by operation of law
in connection with a merger, consolidation, recapitalization,

     

   

reclassification or exchange of Shares, reorganization or similar transaction
involving the Company and affecting Parent Shares generally or (C) with the
approval of Parent, to a member of the holderÂ’s family, or a trust primarily
for the benefit of the holder and/or one or more members of the holderÂ’s
family, or to a corporation, partnership or other entity primarily for the
benefit of the holder and/or one or more such family members and/or trusts or
(D) with the approval of the Parent, in another estate or personal financial
planning transaction ( _provided, however_ , that in any such case the Parent
Shares so Transferred shall remain subject in the hands of the Transferee to
the restrictions on Transfer provided hereby and, except in the case of a
Transfer referred to in the foregoing clause (A) of this sentence, shall
remain subject to forfeiture upon the transferor Company Unitholder
subsequently ceasing to be an Employee in Good Standing before the expiration
of the period of restriction on Transfer of such Parent Shares, as provided
by the first or second sentence of this paragraph and (2) no Transfer of such
Parent Shares shall be permitted unless such Transfer (A) shall be
registered under the Securities Act and registered or qualified under any
applicable state securities law or the holder has established to the ParentÂ’s
reasonable satisfaction that the Transfer is exempt from such registration
or qualification and (B) shall be made in accordance with any restrictions
on Transfer of Parent Shares to which holder may be subject as an
employee, officer and/or director of the Parent or a Subsidiary thereof by
reason of federal or state securities laws and/or the policies regarding
transactions in securities of the Parent from time to time adopted by the
Parent and applicable to the holder. Except in respect of the foregoing
restrictions on Transfer and forfeiture requirement, a holder of such Parent
Shares shall be entitled to the benefit of, and to exercise, all rights,
powers and privileges of ownership of such shares, including without
limitation the right to receive dividends and distributions thereon, and to
vote such shares and to exercise any rights of dissent or appraisal or to
make any election attendant upon ownership of such shares; _provided,
however_ , that to the extent any dividend shall be paid or distribution made
on such shares in any shares or securities of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent during the period in which Transfer of such shares is restricted
hereby, then such shares or securities shall be likewise restricted from
Transfer and subject to forfeiture to the Acquiring Corp. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, upon a Transfer of any such
Parent Shares after the expiration of such restrictions on Transfer (or with
such consent), the foregoing restrictions shall terminate as to the
Transferee of such Parent Shares. Parent may legend any certificates
representing such Parent Shares (or other shares or securities distributed in
respect thereof) in such manner, or enter appropriate stop transfer
instructions with any transfer agent or registrar, as may be reasonably
determined by Parent to be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.1(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.1(e)_, (1) in the event the Acquiring Corp. is required to deposit with the
Escrow Agent (or, in lieu thereof, deliver to the Unitholder Representative
an irrevocable letter of credit) in respect of the amount of the Deferred
Payment as provided by _Section 2.2(a) _and has failed to do so within 120
days after becoming required to do so or the Acquiring Corp. fails to make
payment to the Company Unitholders of the Deferred Payment within five
business days after becoming obligated to do so or (2) in the event a Company
Unitholder terminates his employment as provided by his employment agreement
referred to in _Section 3.25_ within

     

   

120 days following a Change of Control of Parent, any Parent Shares
theretofore issued to a Company Unitholder as Earn-out Consideration shall no
longer be subject to restrictions on transfer or to forfeiture as provided
herein.

  

(f) _Successor Securities_. If there shall be any change in or exchange of
the outstanding Parent Shares prior to the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_, by reason of a recapitalization, reorganization or
exchange of shares including any such change or exchange effectuated by an
amendment of ParentÂ’s certificate of incorporation or by a merger or
consolidation, all references in this Agreement to "Parent Shares" shall
likewise refer to the shares as so changed or the shares or other securities
into which the Parent Shares are so changed or exchanged. The provision of
this _Section 2.1(f) _shall apply to each such successive change or
exchange.

  

(g) _Working Capital Payment and Adjustment_. In addition to the
consideration payable to the Company Unitholders as provided by _Section
2.1(b)_, the Acquiring Corp. will make the payments in respect of the
CompanyÂ’s "Working Capital" as of the Closing Date hereinafter in this
_Section 2.1(g) _provided for.

  

(i) The CompanyÂ’s " **Working Capital** " shall be in the amount (determined
as hereinafter provided) by which the CompanyÂ’s current assets exceed its
current liabilities as of the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied by the Company; it being understood, however, that
in determining the Working Capital the amount owed on the note issued by
the Company to Raju Mantena and outstanding on the date hereof (which on the
date hereof approximates $2.45 million), will not be considered a current
liability of the Company nor will any other amount owed by the Company to any
Company Unitholder for borrowed money (the " **Working Capital Loans**
"). The Company has provided Parent in writing its good faith estimate of
the amount of its Working Capital as of March 31, 2006 and shall
provide Parent in writing a good faith estimate of the Working Capital and
the amount of the Working Capital Loans as of the Closing Date, signed by its
chief executive and chief financial officers, no later than three business
days before the Closing Date, explaining any material change in the
CompanyÂ’s Working Capital since March 31, 2006.

  

(ii) The Acquiring Company will pay to the Company at the Closing, in
respect of its Working Capital as of the Closing Date, in cash the amount of
the Working Capital Loans as estimated by the Company as provided
in paragraph (i) of this section. The Company will repay in their
entirety, substantially simultaneously with the Closing, the Working Capital
Loans.

  

(iii) After consulting with the Unitholder Representative, the Company not
later than 90 days after the Closing shall provide the Acquiring Corp. and
the Unitholder Representative with a revised estimate of the CompanyÂ’s
Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " **Estimated Working Capital
Amount** "), explaining any material change in the CompanyÂ’s Working Capital
as of the Closing Date as estimated before the Closing. On January 31, 2007,
the

     

   

Acquiring Corp. shall pay to the Company Unitholders, divided among them in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, the amount equal to
$6,000,000 less the estimated amount of the Working Capital Loans paid by the
Acquiring Corp. to the Company at the Closing.

  

(iv) As soon as practicable after the beginning of the thirteenth month after
the Closing Date, the Company shall re-calculate its Working Capital as of
the Closing Date taking into account all relevant post-Closing events until
such time. Acquiring Corp. and the Unitholder Representative will cooperate
with the Company in determining a mutually agreeable amount for the re-
calculated Working Capital as of the Closing Date. In the event of a
disagreement between the Unitholder Representative and Acquiring Corp. as to
the Working Capital as of the Closing Date so re-calculated, the Unitholder
Representative and Acquiring Corp. will jointly select a reasonably
acceptable independent public accounting firm to determine the amount of the
Working Capital as of the Closing Date, which determination shall be final
and binding upon all parties in interest. Expenses relating to the
independent public accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Acquiring
Corp. and the Unitholder Representative. The difference, if any, between the
recalculated Working Capital and the total amount of the payments on account
of the CompanyÂ’s Working Capital made by the Acquiring Corp. to the Company
in accordance with paragraph (ii) of this section and made to the Company
Unitholders in accordance with paragraph (iii) of this section will be
promptly settled by either an additional cash payment to the
Company Unitholders (divided among them in accordance with their Percentage
Interests) by Acquiring Corp., if the difference is positive, or by a cash
payment to Acquiring Corp. by the Unitholder Representative on behalf of all
the Company Unitholders if the difference is negative. If any such settlement
payment is not made within five business days of demand therefor, such
payment shall bear interest at the prime rate as from time to time in effect
(as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus 400 basis points from the
date of demand to the date of payment. If such payment is payable to the
Acquiring Corp. and is not paid upon demand, the Acquiring Corp. may elect by
notice to the Unitholder Representative at any time before payment thereof is
made to the Acquiring Corp. to reduce the amount of the Deferred Payment by
the amount so owed to it.

  

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.1(g)_, the
maximum amount payable by Acquiring Corp. pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and
(iv) of this section shall not exceed $25,000,000.

  

SECTION 2.2   _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a) Acquiring Corp. shall simultaneously with the Closing (and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing provided by _Article
VI_) pay, out of and as part of the Aggregate Initial Cash Purchase Price, an
aggregate of $185,000,000, such payment to be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a single bank account that shall be designated
by notice given not less than three

     

   

business days before the Closing by the Company to Parent and signed by or on
behalf of all the Company Unitholders. It is understood and agreed that such
payment shall be applied, as the Company Unitholders shall determine, so as
to satisfy any obligations of the Company and/or expenses of the Company
relating to the Transactions, as further provided by the last sentence of
_Section 5.1_, and otherwise shall be divided among the Company Unitholders
ratably in accordance with their respective Target Percentage Interests
pertaining to their Company Units. Parent, however, shall have no
responsibility with respect to the application of such payment once made to
such account; the Company and the Company Unitholders shall be responsible
for satisfying at or before the Closing the obligations and expenses of the
Company referred to in the last sentence of _Section 5.1. _The Acquiring
Corp. on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if such day is not a
business day, the next business day) shall pay to the Company Unitholders,
divided among them ratably in accordance with their respective Target
Percentage Interests pertaining to their Company Units (as held immediately
before the Closing as contemplated by _Section 2.1(a))_, the sum (the "
**Deferred Payment** ") of (1) an aggregate of $25,000,000, out of and as
part of the Aggregate Initial Cash Purchase Price, plus (2) the aggregate
amount equal to the interest that would accrue on $25,000,000 at the Magellan
Cash Investment Rate (or as provided below, at double such rate) on a daily
basis, compounding quarterly, from the Closing Date to the date preceding the
date of payment thereof, subject, however, to reduction of such amount
(including the amount on which such interest accrual shall be calculated) if
and as provided by _Sections 2.1(g) _and _5.10_ or _Article VIII_. In the
event that prior to the date the Deferred Payment becomes payable (1) the
credit rating issued by Standard and Poors Corporation for ParentÂ’s
senior unsecured debt falls below a "B" rating or (2) the credit rating
issued by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service for ParentÂ’s senior unsecured debt falls
below a "B2" rating or (3) ParentÂ’s senior unsecured debt ceases to have any
credit rating by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service or by Standard and Poors Corporation
or (4) Parent receives a notice of default under its Credit Agreement, the
Acquiring Corp. shall promptly after the happening of such event deposit into
an escrow account to be established at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.
(the " **Escrow Agent** ) an amount of cash equal to the then amount of the
Deferred Payment (including any portion thereof determined as an accrual of
interest and after any reductions thereto theretofore made resulting from the
application of _Sections 2.1(g) _or _5.10_ or _Article VIII)_ (the "
**Escrow Amount** ") with the Escrow Agent to be held in an escrow account
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement consistent with the terms of this Agreement
and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Unitholder Representative (the "
**Escrow Agreement** "). In the event that the Escrow Amount is not so
deposited into escrow by the Acquiring Corp. within 30 days after the
happening of such event, the amount of the Deferred Payment shall increase by
an amount equal to the interest that would accrue on the Deferred Payment at
double the Magellan Cash Investment Rate on a daily basis, compounding
quarterly, from the date following such thirtieth (30th) day to the date
preceding the day the Deferred Payment Amount either is deposited in escrow
as provided by the immediately preceding sentence or is paid to the Company
Unitholders as provided hereby. The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow
pending resolution of claims for indemnification (if any) pursuant to
_Section 8.2 _and may be reduced in respect of amounts payable as
indemnification

     

   

hereunder in accordance with _Article VIII_ and may also be reduced as
provided by _Sections 2.1(g) _or _5.10_. The Escrow Amount shall be invested
by the Escrow Agent in money-market instruments and interest thereon shall be
added to and become part of the Escrow Amount. After such deposit in escrow,
the Deferred Payment shall no longer increase by the amount equal to the
accrual of interest at the Magellan Cash Investment Rate provided hereby but
any earnings on the amount in escrow, after application to any income taxes
due thereon and any expenses of the escrow, shall be for the benefit of the
Company Unitholders. The Escrow Amount shall be paid to the Company
Unitholders out of the escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement at the
same time as the Deferred Payment would have been paid to the Company
Unitholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
2.2(a)_, Parent may elect, in its discretion, in lieu of depositing the then
Deferred Payment amount in escrow as provided by such provisions, to deliver
to the Unitholder Representative an irrevocable letter of credit, issued by a
bank reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Unitholder Representative,
in the amount equal to the sum of (1) the then Deferred Payment amount at
such time plus (2) the aggregate amount equal to the interest that would
accrue on such amount on a daily basis, compounding quarterly, at the
Magellan Cash Investment Rate in effect for the fiscal quarter of Parent
immediately preceding such time over the period from the date to delivery of
such letter of credit to the date on which the Deferred Payment is payable to
the Company Unitholders hereunder. Such letter of credit shall permit the
Unitholder Representative to draw thereon for the amount of the Deferred
Payment on the date on which the Deferred Payment first becomes payable to
the Company Unitholders hereunder and shall be in such customary form as
Parent and the Unitholder Representative shall reasonably agree upon. For all
purposes of this Agreement, references to the Escrow Amount shall also refer
to such letter of credit if such letter of credit is delivered in lieu
of depositing the Escrow Amount in escrow as provided above.

  

(b) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Units_. The
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company Units upon the
surrender for exchange of Company Units in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall, as of the Effective Time, be in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Units (or other securities, as applicable)
previously represented by such Company Units, and as of the start of business
on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, no further Transfers of
Company Units shall be permitted (and the CompanyÂ’s transfer books shall be
closed) and there likewise shall be no further transfers by the Surviving
Company of Company Units (or other securities of the Company, as applicable)
that were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Units outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Units, except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein or as otherwise specifically provided herein or by applicable
law. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any certificate or instrument
representing a Company Unit is presented to the Surviving Company for any
reason, it shall be canceled.

(c) _No Liability for Abandoned Property_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto or the Surviving
company shall be liable to any Person for any consideration otherwise payable
hereunder but delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(d) _Withholding Taxes_. Acquiring Corp. shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment to be made to a Company Unitholder hereunder, other
than a payment of the Aggregate Initial Cash Purchase Price, such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld by Acquiring Corp. (or Parent on
its behalf) with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " **Code** "), or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

SECTION 2.3 _Adjustments to Company Units_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this _Article II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the
covenants in _Section 5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding number of Company Units shall have been
changed into a different number of units or a different class of membership
interest or other securities issued by the Company by reason of the
occurrence of or record date for any dividend, subdivision, split,
combination, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, exchange of
membership interests or similar transaction, the consideration payable in
respect of a Company Unit and any such changed or additional membership
interests or securities of the Company as a result of the Merger shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of membership interests or similar transaction but no change shall be made in
the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

SECTION 2.4 _Guarantee of Parent_. The obligations of Acquiring Corp. to pay
and deliver the Merger Consideration (including Parent Shares) to the Company
Unitholders as herein provided is hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guaranteed by Parent. ParentÂ’s guarantee herein shall be a guaranty of
payment (and not of collection). ParentÂ’s obligations hereunder as guarantor
shall be no greater than those of the Acquiring Corp. and to the extent that
the Acquiring Corp. is afforded conditions to its obligations, defenses,
offsets, cure periods, notice periods, remedies and rights under
this Agreement or applicable Law, Parent shall be entitled to the benefit of
the same.

other representatives (collectively, " **Representatives** ") to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (1) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or
proposals that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a

negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal or (3)
enter into any agreement related to any Takeover Proposal.

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company provided by this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations (or continuation of discussions or
negotiations) are sought to be initiated with, the Company in respect of any
Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the
identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact
and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any
inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any
written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such
proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep
Parent fully informed of all material developments affecting the status and
terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company
shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received
that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the
status of any such discussions or negotiations.

     

   

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Takeover Proposal** " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any (A) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including securities of Subsidiaries), (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
Company Units or member interests, shares of capital stock, securities or
equity interests in or of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than the Transactions.

  

SECTION 5.3 _Best Efforts_.

  

(a) _Lender Consent_. Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain, as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the consent required under the Credit
Agreement to permit it and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Transactions.
Parent shall keep Company reasonably informed of the progress of its efforts
to obtain such consent. If Parent has not received the consent so required
under the Credit Agreement within thirty (30) days of the date hereof, Parent
will use its best efforts to refinance the Credit Agreement on terms
permitting it and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Transactions.

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly
and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions. For purposes hereof, " **Antitrust Laws** " means
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or
acquisition.

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within three (3) business days of the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other

     

   

actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Parent covenants and agrees that it shall be solely responsible
for the filings or related fees incurred by Parent and the Company in
connection with the aforementioned filings under the HSR Act.

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties
hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other party and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.

  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.4_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without ParentÂ’s prior written consent,
commit to any divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on its
business, and nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall (i) limit any applicable
rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_ so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this _Section 5.4_ or (ii) require Parent
to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of its
or the CompanyÂ’s businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a
combination of ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s respective businesses, operations,
assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line
of business, and/or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent,
the Company, the Surviving company or any of their Affiliates may carry on
business in any part of the world.

  

SECTION 5.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may

     

   

be required by Law or in the case of the Parent by its listing agreement with
Nasdaq as determined in its good faith judgment (in which case such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation insofar as practicable with
the Company).

  

SECTION 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company agrees that, prior
to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII, Parent shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and
representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to make such
investigation of the properties, businesses and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and such examination of the books, records and financial
condition of the Company as it reasonably requests and to make extracts and
copies of such books and records. No investigation by Parent prior to or
after the date of this Agreement shall diminish or obviate any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company contained
in this Agreement or the Company Documents. Any such investigation by Parent
shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its officers,
employees or representatives shall, prior to the Closing Date, have any
contact whatsoever with any customer, lender, lessor, vendor,
supplier, employee or consultant of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except
in consultation with the Company and then only with the express prior
approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
All requests by Parent for access or information shall be submitted or
directed exclusively to an individual or individuals to be designated by the
Company. In order that Parent may have full opportunity to make such
physical, business, accounting and legal review, examination or investigation
as it may reasonably request of the affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and
other representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate fully
with such representatives in connection with such review and examination.
Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2006, between Parent and the Company (as it
may be amended from time to time, the " **Confidentiality Agreement** "),
Parent and its Representatives shall hold information received from the
Company pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

SECTION 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s knowledge,
threatened against or otherwise involving such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates which relate to the Transactions, (iii)
the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or

     

   

non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would
cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in this
Agreement (A) that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue or (B) that is
not so qualified to be untrue in any material respect or, in the case of the
Company, would cause any of the information provided in the Company
Disclosure Schedules to not be true and correct as of the time such
information was provided in light of such discovery or occurrence or non-
occurrence, and (iv) any material failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.6_ shall not (x) cure any breach of any representation of
warranty of the party giving such notice or any non-compliance by the party
giving such notice with any covenant, agreement or other provision contained
in this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice in respect of such breach or non-compliance.

  

SECTION 5.7 _Intentionally Omitted_.

  

SECTION 5.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as may otherwise be provided herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

SECTION 5.9 _Change In Control Customer Contracts_. The Company shall, prior
to the Closing Date, (i) notify each third party to the Change In Control
Customer Contracts listed on Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
of the Transactions and (ii) request and receive a waiver, if required, of
any termination rights arising as a result of the Transactions from each such
party.

  

SECTION 5.10 _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) Parent and the Unitholder Representative agree to allocate the Merger
Consideration and liabilities of the Company existing immediately prior to
the Closing to the assets of the Company based on the fair market value of
such assets within ninety (90) days after the Closing. Such allocation shall
be prepared by Parent and delivered to the Unitholder Representative as of
the Closing (the " **Allocation Schedule** "). Within thirty (30) days after
the Unitholder RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Allocation Schedule, initial
or revised, as the case may be, the Unitholder Representative shall indicate
its concurrence therewith, or propose to Parent any changes to such
Allocation Schedule. The Unitholder RepresentativeÂ’s failure to notify Parent
of any objection to such Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof shall constitute the Unitholder RepresentativeÂ’s concurrence
therewith. The Unitholder Representative and Parent will negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disputes regarding the Allocation Schedule. If the
Unitholder Representative and Parent are unable to resolve any disputes
regarding the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days of ParentÂ’s receipt
of such changes, then such dispute will be submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm for resolution as soon as practicable. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to determine,
based solely on the written submissions of the

     

   

parties and not by independent investigation, only the specific items under
dispute by the parties. Each of the Parent, Unitholder Representative and the
Company (as applicable) shall complete and timely file all forms and
statements (and any exhibits thereto), including Tax Returns, required by
applicable Tax laws, in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, as revised
from time to time as provided herein, in accordance with applicable Tax laws,
and none of them shall take a position on any Tax Return or other form or
statement contrary with such allocation.

  

(b) The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to
be filed) when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all
Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice; provided that there is
a reasonable basis for the positions claimed on such Tax Returns. The Company
shall deliver to Parent copies of each such Tax Return at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and shall permit
Parent to review and approve such Tax Return prior to filing (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the parties have not
resolved any dispute relating to any such Tax Return prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Return, then the Company shall file such Tax Return as
prepared, but such filing shall not prejudice the rights of any party to
pursue such dispute.

  

(c) Parent and Company recognize that, for federal income tax purposes and
for state income tax purposes, the Company will file a final partnership tax
return for the period ending at the Closing Date, and there will be no
Straddle Period. The Unitholder Representative will cause to be prepared and
filed the final partnership income tax returns, subject to ParentÂ’s review
and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

(d) Following the Closing, Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and
file (or cause to be filed) when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns, other than the Company final partnership
return described in _Section 5.10(c)_, required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. A copy of any such
Tax Return with respect to which Tax is owing and for which the Company
Unitholders are liable pursuant hereto shall be delivered to the Unitholder
Representative, along with a statement (a " **Tax Statement** ") showing the
Unitholder RepresentativeÂ’s share of any Taxes owed that are reflected on
such Tax Return (which shall be computed in accordance with Section 8.2(e)),
at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return,
and shall permit the Unitholder Representative to review and approve such Tax
Return and Tax Statement prior to filing (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the parties have not resolved any
dispute relating to any such Tax Return prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Return, then Parent shall file such Tax Return as prepared, but such
filing shall not prejudice the rights of any party to pursue such dispute.

     

   

(e) Not later than two (2) days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods
which Parent has the responsibility to file (or cause to be filed) pursuant
to _Section 5.10(b)_, the Parent shall reduce the amount of the Deferred
Payment by the amount shown on the corresponding Tax Statement; _provided,
however_ , that, in the event that the Unitholder Representative disputes the
amount shown on the Tax Statement, the dispute resolution provisions of
_Section 8.3(c) _shall apply and the Deferred Paymentnt shall not be
considered reduced by the contested amount of the Tax Statement until the
dispute is resolved. No payment pursuant to this _Section 5.10(e) _shall
excuse the Unitholder Representative from its indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined
(on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns exceeds
the funds distributed or available to be distributed from the Withhold under
this _Section 5.10(e)_.

  

(f) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to Straddle
Periods, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Company (a " **Short
Period** "). In any case where applicable Law does not permit the Company to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Short Period, then for purposes
of this Agreement, the portion of each Tax that is attributable to the
operations of the Company for the period which would have qualified as a
Short Period if such election had been permitted by applicable Law (an "
**Interim Period** ") shall be (1) in the case of a Tax that is not based on
net income or receipts, the total amount of such Tax for the period in
question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Interim Period, and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is based
on net income or receipts, the Tax that would be due with respect to the
Interim Period if such Interim Period were a Short Period determined based
upon an interim closing of the books.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the sole right to control, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any claim or proceeding relating to a
Tax Loss; provided that, with respect to any Tax Loss for which the
Unitholder Representative otherwise shall be liable under the indemnification
provisions hereunder, Parent (i) shall keep the Unitholder Representative
apprised of all developments relating to such claim or proceeding, (ii) shall
provide the Unitholder Representative with copies of all correspondence from
any taxing authority relating to any such claim or proceeding, (iii) shall
provide the Unitholder Representative in advance with any proposed submission
relating to such claim or proceeding, (iv) shall consult with the Unitholder
Representative in good faith concerning any such submission and the conduct
of the proceeding, and (v) shall not finally settle any such claim or
proceeding without the prior written consent of Unitholder Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

(h) Each party hereto agree to co-operate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns,

     

   

any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. The parties
further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any taxing authority or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

  

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and similar
Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the
Company Unitholders and Parent.

  

SECTION 5.11 _Employment Agreements_. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, take any action to amend or terminate the
employment agreements identified on _Exhibit 3.25_.

ARTICLE VII 
 Termination

  

SECTION 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

been received consistent with the requirements of such sections by September
30, 2006 (the " **Walk-Away Date** "), __ then the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i) _shall not be available to a
party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the
Walk-Away Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement; or

  

(i) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(b) _shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable or if any
Restraint resulting from any judicial or administrative injunction, judgment,
order or any arbitration award is in effect and, although such injunction,
judgment, order or award is subject to appeal or review and, as a result, to
being reversed, over-ruled, dissolved or revoked, in the good faith judgment
of the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, such reversal, over-ruling,
dissolution or revocation cannot reasonably be expected to occur before the
Walk-Away Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ _,_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(ii) _shall not be available to a party
if such Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

  

(c) by Parent:

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties (or if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct) or if the Company
has breached or failed to perform or adhere to any of its covenants or
agreements (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with
_Section 5.2(a)_) set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure (A)
would, if it occurred or was continuing on the Closing Date, give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a) _or _(b) _and (B) is
not cured by the Company within ten calendar days following receipt of
written notice from Parent of such breach or failure or is incapable of being
cured before the Walk-Away Date; or

  

(ii) after the date of this Agreement there shall have occurred any events or
changes in circumstances or states of fact that, individually or in the

Adverse Effect on the Company; or

_Sections 5.4_ , _5.5_ and _5.8_ , this _Section 7.2_ and, insofar as
pertinent to the application of this Section 7.2, _Article IX_, all of which

therewith, _provided_  that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants; Indemnification

  

SECTION 8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

  

(a) _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
for one year from the Closing Date. The representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " **Expiration Date** "),  _
_provided__ , __however__ , that the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 3.10_ (taxes) and _Section 3.18_ (health
regulatory compliance) shall survive the Closing indefinitely until ninety
(90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to a claim by a third party that, if true, would constitute a
breach of such representation and warranty. Any claim of breach of a
representation or warranty contained herein not set forth in reasonable
detail (based on the factual information then reasonably available to the
claimant) by written notice to the party who is claimed to have breached such
representation or warranty before the expiration of the period of survival of
such representation or warranty provided hereby is hereby barred, may not be
pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived as of the expiration of such
survival period.

  

(b) _Survival of Covenants_. All covenants and agreements of the parties made
in this Agreement which contemplate performance following the Closing shall
survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. All covenants and
agreements of the parties made in this Agreement that contemplate performance
prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that (1) if any such covenant or agreement was breached by Parent on or prior
to the Closing, the Company Unitholders shall nevertheless have in respect of
such breach the rights and remedies provided by law if, but only if, written
notice of such breach is given to Parent before the first anniversary of the
Closing Date. and (2) if any such covenant or agreement was breached by the
Company on or prior to the Closing, Parent shall nevertheless have in respect
of such breach the rights and remedies provided by the following provisions
of this _Article VIII_ if, but only if, Parent has delivered an
Indemnification Notice with respect to such breach before the Expiration
Date. Any claim of breach of a covenant or agreement contained herein that
contemplates performance prior to the Closing Date not set forth in
reasonable detail (based on the factual information then reasonably available
to the claimant) by

     

   

written notice to the party who is claimed to have breached such covenant or
agreement before the expiration of the period for assertion of such claims
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is hereby barred, may not be
pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived as of the expiration of such period.

  

SECTION 8.2 _Indemnification_.

  

(a) _Right to Indemnity_. The Company Unitholders, to the extent (and only to
such extent) and in the manner hereinafter provided, shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, the Acquiring Corp., the Surviving Company and their
respective subsidiaries, and the directors, officers, employees, consultants,
attorneys, agents and representatives thereof (the " **Parent Indemnified
Parties** ") from and against any and all Losses (irrespective of whether or
not such Losses arise out of or in connection with a third party claim) to
the extent, but only to the extent, resulting from, arising out of or
otherwise relating to:

  

(i) any failure of the representations and warranties made by the Company
set forth in this Agreement or in any Company Document to be true and correct
(without regard to any notice given by the Company in accordance with clause
(iii) of the first sentence of _Section 5.6)_;

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement required by this
Agreement to be performed by the Company prior to the Closing, or

  

(iii) any Tax Losses,

  

such Losses collectively being referred to herein as " **Parent Indemnifiable
Losses** ;" _provided, however_ , that (i) the Parent Indemnified Parties may
not recover any amount for Parent Indemnifiable Losses, unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Parent Indemnifiable Losses, other than Tax
Losses, exceeds $500,000 (the " **Deductible** "), with any Tax Losses not
being subject to any Deductible, and then only with respect to such amounts
of Parent Indemnifiable Losses, other than Tax Losses, in excess of the
Deductible, (ii) the maximum amount of indemnity that all Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to for all claims of indemnity hereunder shall not
exceed $35,000,000, and (iii) the Parent Indemnified Parties may not recover
any amount for Parent Indemnifiable Losses from the Working Capital Payment
described in Section 2.2(g) herein. For purposes of applying the
indemnification provisions of this _Article VIII_, in determining whether a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement referred to _Section 8.2(a)
_or _(b) _had been breached or violated, and in calculating the Losses
sustained by reason of a breach or failure by the Company referred to in
_Section 8.2(a) _or  _(b)_ , any materiality (including Material Adverse
Effect) qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements so breached or violated shall be ignored.

  

(b) _Tax Losses_. For purposes of _Section 8.2(a)_, " **Tax Losses** " means
any and all Losses attributable to (1) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
the Company

     

   

or its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including the portion of
any Straddle Period attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and including
any Taxes arising by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) or to
the Closing itself and (2) Taxes against which Parent shall be entitled to
indemnity under the Subscription Agreements.

  

(c) _Sources of Indemnity Payments_. Subject to the following provisions of
this _Article VIII_, reduction of the Deferred Payment (or a disbursement to
Parent from the Escrow Account, if the Escrow Account shall have been
established) shall be the source for funding any indemnity payment due to a
Parent Indemnified Party hereunder, but to the extent the amount of the
Deferred Payment (or amount in the Escrow Account) is not sufficient
therefor, the Parent may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of the cash to
be included in a payment of Earn-out Consideration it expects to make by the
amount equal to the amount due to a Parent Indemnified Party as indemnity
hereunder and not satisfied by reduction of the Deferred Payment (or a
disbursement to Parent from the Escrow Account) and, to the extent the amount
so due to a Parent Indemnified Party is not so satisfied, then the Unitholder
Representative shall be required to pay all of such additional sums due and
owing to the Parent Indemnified Party by transfer of immediately available
funds within thirty (30) days after the date of notice. To the extent any
amount is due to a Parent Indemnified Party other than Parent pursuant to
this _Article VIII_, Parent shall seek recovery of such amount on behalf of
the Parent Indemnified Party (and is hereby authorized to act on behalf of
such Parent Indemnified Party for such purpose) by a reduction of the
Deferred Payment or by a disbursement from the Escrow Account in an amount
equal to the amount due to such Parent Indemnified Party, and Parent, upon
recovery thereof, shall promptly pay the amount thereof over to such Parent
Indemnified Party, __provided__ , __however__ , to the extent the amount
so due to such Parent Indemnified Party is not satisfied by reduction of
the Deferred Payment or a disbursement from the Escrow Account, the
Unitholder Representative shall be required to pay all of such additional
sums due and owing to such Parent Indemnified Party by transfer of
immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after the date of notice
of any sums then due and owing is given to the Unitholder Representative by
the Parent Indemnified Party. If the Unitholder Representative shall have
disputed the making of an indemnification payment to Parent by reduction of
the Deferred Amount, or a disbursement from the Escrow Account, as provided
by _Section 8.4(c) _and such payment remains in dispute at such time as
Parent is required to make a payment of Earn-out Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_, then Parent may, in its discretion, make such payment
of Earn-out Consideration, to the extent of all or part of the amount of
the indemnification payment so disputed, into the Escrow Account (if then
in existence) or into an escrow account to be established on substantially
the same terms as provided for the funding of the Deferred Payment amount
into escrow by _Section 2.2(a)_. In such event, upon resolution of
such dispute as provided by _Section 8.3(c)_, the entire amount
so deposited in escrow (and any net earnings thereon) shall be disbursed out
of escrow either to Parent in payment of such indemnification or to the
Unitholder Representative (for the benefit of Company Unitholders), as
appropriate depending on the resolution of such dispute, the amount of the
indemnity payment, if any, to be made by to Parent and the amount of Earn-out
Consideration so withheld. The 

     

   

Unitholder Representative shall be entitled to seek reimbursement or
contribution from each other Company Unitholder, in accordance with such
agreement as may exist between the Unitholder Representative and such Company
Unitholder or as permitted by law, for the pro rata portion of any such
indemnity payment made by the Unitholder Representative determined by the
ratio of the amount of Merger Consideration received by such Company
Unitholder in relation to the total amount of Merger Consideration paid by
Parent, in each case to the date the Unitholder Representative made such
indemnity payment.

  

SECTION 8.3   _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a) _Indemnification Notices_. In order to obtain indemnity in respect of a
Loss as provided by _Section 8.2_, a Parent Indemnified Party shall give an
"Indemnification Notice" to the Unitholder Representative. For the purposes
hereof, an " **Indemnification Notice** " shall mean a notice signed by any
officer of Parent and delivered to the Unitholder Representative and (i)
stating that Parent has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it will be obligated to pay, incur, sustain or accrue, a
Loss against which it is entitled to indemnity, (ii) specifying in reasonable
detail the nature of such Loss (including the calculation thereof or the
basis for estimation thereof), the date insofar as practicable such Loss was
paid or is expected to be incurred, sustained or accrued or the basis on
which it anticipates incurring, sustaining or accruing such Loss, and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant resulting in
such Loss or out of which such Loss arose or to which such Loss relates or
the nature of the Tax Loss, and (iii) the amount of cash to be delivered to
Parent (for the benefit of the pertinent Parent Indemnified Party) as
indemnity against each such Loss. If a Loss is anticipated but not yet
incurred, sustained or accrued at the time an Indemnification Notice is
given, an additional Indemnification Notice shall be given providing such
information regarding the Loss incurred, sustained or accrued as was not
included in an earlier Indemnification Notice. In a case where a Parent
Indemnified Party other than Parent shall seek to obtain the indemnity
provides by _Section 8.2_, Parent shall give an appropriate Indemnification
Notice on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party, provided that such Parent
Indemnified Party has provided to Parent such information as Parent may
reasonably request for such purpose.

  

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. A Parent Indemnified Party shall give the
Unitholder Representative written notice (which may be part of an
Indemnification Notice) of any claim, assertion or action by or in respect of
a third party, including any civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory,
investigative or arbitral proceeding, as to which such Parent Indemnified
Party may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Deductible may
be applied as soon as is practicable and in any event within fifteen calendar
days of the time that such Parent Indemnified Party learns of such claim,
assertion, action or proceeding; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so
notify the Unitholder Representative shall not affect the rights of the
Parent Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
that the Unitholder Representative (as such) is prejudiced by such failure.
Parent (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Parent Indemnified Party
if such claim, assertion, action or proceeding involves another

     

   

Parent Indemnified Party) shall direct, through counsel of its own choosing
reasonably acceptable to the Unitholder Representative, the response to,
defense of or settlement of any such claim, assertion, action or proceeding,
but the cost thereof shall be an indemnifiable Loss in accordance with
_Section 8.2_. Parent shall consult with the Unitholder Representative for
the purpose of allowing the Unitholder Representative to participate in
responding to, defending or settlement of claim, assertion, action or
proceeding, but in such case the expenses of the Unitholder Representative,
including the fees and disbursements of its counsel, shall be paid by the
Unitholder Representative. Parent shall provide and shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide (during normal business hours) the Unitholder
Representative and its counsel with reasonable access to the records and
personnel of the Surviving Company and Parent relating to any claim,
assertion, action or proceeding subject to indemnity hereunder during normal
business hours. If the Unitholder Representative shall determine to be
represented by counsel in any such proceeding, Parent shall cooperate, and
cause the counsel representing it in such proceeding to cooperate, with
counsel representing the Unitholder Representative in such proceeding. Parent
shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any third party claim or
demand in respect of which indemnification has been sought hereunder unless
the Unitholder Representative consents in writing to such payment (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or unless a final judgment from
which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Unitholder Representative
is entered against the Parent Indemnified Party for such liability or unless,
upon request of Parent, the Unitholder Representative has failed to show to
ParentÂ’s reasonable satisfaction that, taking into account the then amount of
the Deferred Payment and any Earn-out Consideration anticipated to be payable
by Parent, there are not readily available to the Unitholder Representative
sufficient funds to pay the amount in respect of such claim, demand or
proceeding for which an Indemnification Notice has been given. If the
Unitholder Representative deposits with Parent an irrevocable letter
of credit, or similar form of financial assurance, in the amount for which
the Indemnification Notice has been given by Parent in connection with
such third-party proceeding, the Unitholder Representative shall be
considered to have shown that there are readily available sufficient funds to
pay such amount.

  

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

  

(i) If the Unitholder Representative shall object in writing to any claim or
claims for indemnification made in any Indemnification Notice within thirty
(30) days after delivery of such Indemnification Notice, then the Unitholder
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Unitholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and the
Parent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and withhold payment
to the Company Unitholders from the Deferred Payment in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within
sixty (60) days after delivery of an Indemnification Notice,

     

   

either Parent or the Unitholder Representative may demand arbitration of the
matter in accordance with the following provisions of this _Section 8.3_
unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. If such dispute is subject
to arbitration, it shall be settled by arbitration conducted in accordance
with the rules and procedures then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and
the Unitholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days
after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Unitholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30)-day period, Parent and the
Unitholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If one party but not
the other fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15)-day period,
then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the one
arbitrator selected by the party which has made such a selection.

  

(iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneysÂ’ fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount
of any claim for indemnification made in an Indemnification Notice shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s). In accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to rely on, and to reduce the amount
of the Deferred Payment in accordance with, the terms of such award,
judgment, decree or order, as applicable. Within ten (10) days of a decision
of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party
shall make the payment to such other party. Judgment upon any award rendered
by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(iv) The foregoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute between
the Unitholder Representative and a Parent Indemnified Party under this
_Article VIII_, whether relating to claims to reduce the amount of the
Deferred Payment or against the Escrow Account or to the other
indemnification obligations set forth in this _Article VIII_.

  

SECTION 8.4   _Reduction of the Deferred Payment Amount._

  

(a) Until payable to the Company Unitholders as provided in accordance with
_Section 2.2(a)_, the Deferred Payment shall be reduced to compensate the
Parent Indemnified Parties for any Losses incurred or sustained by them and
against which they are entitled to indemnity under this _Article VIII_;
_provided, howeve_ r, that Acquiring Corp. shall not be required to pay the
Deferred Payment to the Company Unitholders when otherwise due hereunder in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a) _with respect to the portion of the
amount of the Deferred Payment equal to 120% of the aggregate amount of any
then unresolved indemnity claims specified in any Indemnification Notice
or Indemnification Notices delivered in good faith to the Company prior to
the time the Deferred Payment is otherwise payable in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a) _(each, an " **Unresolved Claim** "). As soon as all
Unresolved Claims have been resolved, Parent shall deliver to the
Company Unitholders (as such immediately before the Closing as contemplated
by _Section 2.1(a)_) the remaining amount of the Deferred Payment, if any,
not applied to satisfy Unresolved Claims.

  

(b) _Claims for Reduction of the Deferred Payment_. Parent shall be entitled
to reduce the amount of the Deferred Payment by an amount equal to the amount
of the indemnity payment stated in the Indemnification Notice to be made in
respect the Losses described in the Indemnification Notice; _provided,
however_ , that, to the extent the Indemnification Notice states only the
basis for anticipated Losses, the Deferred Payment shall not be so reduced
until such Losses are actually paid, incurred or sustained as specified in a
further Indemnification Notice. If the Unitholder Representative does not
object to an Indemnification Notice in writing within the 30-day period set
forth in _Section 8.4(c) _after delivery by Parent of an Indemnification
Notice, such failure to so object shall constitute an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Unitholder Representative, on behalf of all holders of
Company Units, that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Notice;
_provided, however_ , that to the extent an Indemnification Notice states
only the basis for anticipated Losses, no amount shall be distributed until
such Losses are actually paid, incurred or sustained (notwithstanding the
Unitholder RepresentativeÂ’s failure to object in writing).

  

(c) _Objections to Claims against the Deferred Payment_. At the time of
delivery of any Indemnification Notice to Unitholder Representative, and for
a period of thirty days after such delivery Parent shall make no reduction in
the Deferred Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(b) _unless the Parent shall
have received written authorization from the Unitholder Representative to
make such delivery. After the expiration of such 30-day period, Parent shall
be entitled to reduce the Deferred Payment to satisfy such 

     

   

claims pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, provided that no deduction shall be
made if the Unitholder Representative shall object in a written statement to
the claim made in the Indemnification Notice, and such statement shall have
been delivered to Parent prior to the expiration of such 30-day period.

  

SECTION 8.5 _Exclusivity of Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time,
except in respect of fraudulent conduct, indemnity in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Parent shall have no other right to pursue any Company Unitholder
for any liability for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company contained herein or in any document delivered as
provided hereby.

  

SECTION 8.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Company and the
Company Unitholders and Parent agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes unless a contrary
treatment is required under applicable Law.

Agreement.

  

(f) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Unitholder Representative,
including an extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_
or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, shall constitute a decision of the Company
Unitholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company
Unitholders; Parent and the Surviving company may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Unitholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of all the Company

 **EXHIBIT 2.1(d)**

  

The CompanyÂ’s " **Adjusted** **EBITDA** " for any period referred to in
paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of _Section 2.1(c) _shall mean the CompanyÂ’s
earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, as customarily determined in accordance with good
business practice except as set forth herein, as adjusted as hereinafter
provided. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA shall reflect the CompanyÂ’s gross
revenues, determined in accordance with GAAP, for such period less the sum of
(1) the CompanyÂ’s cost of goods sold, determined in accordance with GAAP, and
(2) general and administrative expenses which shall include all direct
expenses of the CompanyÂ’s operations as well as indirect expenses related to
the support of the CompanyÂ’s operations but shall not include after the
Closing any allocation of overhead costs of the Parent (as distinguished from
administrative costs of the CompanyÂ’s operations administered by the Parent),
even though otherwise allocable to the Company in accordance with ParentÂ’s
customary accounting practice, determined in accordance with GAAP, and
excluding any compensation charges relating to the payment of any portion of
the Merger Consideration, and (3) depreciation and amortization in respect of
all capital expenditures incurred after the Closing by the Company or on
behalf of the CompanyÂ’s operations, determined in accordance with GAAP, but
not including amortization or impairment of goodwill and/or any other
intangible assets created by the Merger, and without any charge to provide
for the CompanyÂ’s federal, state or local incomes tax liability on its
taxable income, provided that (A) the CompanyÂ’s revenues and cost of goods
sold and general and administrative expenses shall be determined on a basis
consistent with that used in the preparation of the CompanyÂ’s audited
financial statements audited by Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C. for the year ended
December 31, 2005 referred to in _Section 3.5_, (B) the CompanyÂ’s
depreciation and amortization with respect to capital expenditures incurred
after the Closing shall be determined on a basis consistent with the basis
for the determination of depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures
by Parent customarily used in the preparation of its financial reports.
Except as expressly provided in this Exhibit 2.1(d), for purposes of this
Agreement, the separate components of the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA shall be
calculated on a basis consistent with the practices used in the preparation
of ParentÂ’s financial statements as filed with the SEC. Parent shall deliver
to the Unitholder Representative by the First Earn-out Distribution Date or
the Second Earn-out Distribution Date, as the case may be, a certificate,
signed by its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer or
Controller certifying to the calculation of the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA for
the periods referred to in paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of  _Section
2.1(c)_, as pertinent.

  

If the Unitholder Representative shall object in writing to any calculation
of Adjusted EBITDA for any period referenced in paragraph (i), (ii) and (iii)
of Section 2.1(c) within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of
such determination, then the Unitholder Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement with respect to the
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. If no such agreement can be reached after
good faith negotiation within thirty (30) days after delivery of the

     

   

UnitholderÂ’s written obligation, Parent and the Unitholder Representative
shall select a mutually acceptable independent accountant (the "
**Independent Accountant** "), who shall determine the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted
EBITDA for their relevant period, and whose determination shall be final and
binding on the parties for purposes of this Agreement. The Independent
AccountantÂ’s fees and expenses shall be borne as follows: if the
Independent Accountant determines that the CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA is
greater than the amount initially calculated by Parent, then Parent shall pay
the fees and expenses; if the Independent Accountant determines that the
CompanyÂ’s Adjusted EBITDA is less than or equal to the amount initially
calculated by Parent, then the Unitholders shall pay the fees and expenses.

 **Officer Â’s Certificate**

  

The undersigned, being the duly elected and incumbent chief executive [ /

Based on my knowledge, the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005, previously delivered to Parent , fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in such report.

3. I have disclosed to Parent in writing any change in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting known to me that occurred during the CompanyÂ’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrantÂ’s internal control over financial reporting.

  

4. I have disclosed to Parent in writing (a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Company internal control over financial reporting known to me which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, known to me that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting.
