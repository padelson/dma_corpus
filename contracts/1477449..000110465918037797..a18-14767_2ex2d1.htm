between the Locked Box Date and the date of this Agreement and undertake that
there shall be no Leakage between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date.

 



 

 **6.1.2** The Parties agree that the sole remedy of the Purchaser in the case
of Leakage occurring between the Locked Box Date and the Closing Date is the

 **6.2.1** In the event of any Leakage between the Locked Box Date and the
Closing Date, each Seller (by way of adjustment of the corresponding Purchase
Price) severally undertakes that it shall, on demand by the Purchaser, subject
to such Seller agreeing that Leakage has occurred and agreeing the amount of
the particular Leakage, pay to the Purchaser or the Company, as applicable,
subject to Clause 6.2.2, an amount in cash equal to such Leakage and any Loss
incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in recovering such Leakage. The
liability of each of the Sellers under this Clause 6 shall be several (
_mancomunada_ ) and not joint and several ( _solidaria_ ).

 



 

 **6.2.2** Where there is a post-Closing adjustment for Leakage pursuant to
Clause 6.2.1, if such Leakage was made to or for the benefit of a particular
Seller(s), or any Affiliate of the Seller(s), that particular Seller shall be
liable to make the payment referred to in Clause 6.2.1 and it shall be treated
as a reduction of the amount of the Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser to
such Seller(s), as applicable. Otherwise (and in any event in relation to any
payment of Transaction Costs or Transaction Bonuses other than Disclosed
Transaction Costs and Disclosed Transaction Bonuses), it shall be made by way
of adjustment of the amount of the Purchase Price, and such adjustment shall
be allocated among the Sellers (by way of reduction of the Purchase Price) in
the Relevant Proportion and each Seller shall

 



      
 

 



 

be liable to make payment of its Relevant Proportion of such Leakage under
Clause 6.2.1.

 



 

 **6.2.3** If the relevant Parties do not reach an agreement on the existence
of a Leakage and/or its amount, the relevant Parties shall mutually appoint an
independent accountant that is reasonably acceptable to such Parties (the "
**Independent Accountant** ") to resolve such disagreement. The relevant
Parties will then have five (5) Business Days to provide the necessary
allegations and supporting documentation to the Independent Accountant. The
Independent Accountant shall then adopt a resolution within fifteen (15)
Business Days from such deadline. The resolution adopted by the Independent
Accountant will be binding upon the relevant Parties, which irrevocably waive
any rights to challenge such decision.

 



 

 **6.2.4** The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of any breach of the
warranty or undertaking given in Clause 6.1 unless written notice specifying
(in reasonable detail) the matter(s) which gives rise to the claim, the nature
of the claim and (if practicable) the amount claimed in respect thereof is
given by or on behalf of the Purchaser to the Sellers Representative, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Purchaser becomes aware of the claim and,
in any event, within nine months following the Closing Date.

 



 

 **6.2.5** For the avoidance of doubt, any post-Closing adjustment for Leakage
shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations on the Sellers

 **8.4.3** _Deductible_

 



 

(i) The Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses under Clause 8.2.1(i)
(other than Losses for a breach of a Sellers Fundamental RandW or a breach of
Clause 1.5 of Part B of the Sellers Representations and Warranties) unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
De Minimis Claims) for which the Sellers would otherwise be liable exceeds
$3,400,000 (the " **Deductible** ").

 



 

(ii) Where the liability agreed or determined in respect of all Losses

(ii) the Loss giving rise to the Claim is a Tax liability of a Group Company

such Group Company since the Locked Box Date (unless the undertaking of such
transaction constitutes a breach of a representation or covenant contained in
this Agreement); or

 



 

(iii) the Loss arises or is increased through the failure or omission by any
Group Company after Closing to make any claim, election, surrender, disclaimer
or to do any other thing which was taken into account in computing the

election, surrender, disclaimer or other thing could not be made or done
consistent with Applicable Laws.

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,

of the Escrow Agreement and Clause 8.7 below.

 



 

 **8.6.2** In the case the amount then-remaining in the Escrow Account is not
sufficient to cover the Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to an
Escrow Claim, the Sellers liability will be limited to the amount then-
remaining in the Escrow Account.

 



      
 

 



 

 **8.6.3** Any Losses incurred as a result of any matter for which
indemnification is required under Clause 8.2.1(i) (solely with respect to

Representative and the Purchaser shall, in accordance with the notification
requirements of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent to pay such
balance to the Sellers Representative.

 



 

 **8.7.3** If an Escrow Claim is settled during the Escrow Period, the
Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall, upon such settlement and in
accordance with the notification requirements of the Escrow Agreement,
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser

(i) the amount due under the Escrow Claim; and

 



 

(ii) the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account.

 



 

 **8.7.4** The Escrow Agent shall be instructed by the Sellers Representative
and the Purchaser to make the following payments from the Escrow Account to
the Sellers during the Escrow Period:

minus (a) the aggregate amount of all payments made from the Escrow Account in
respect of Escrow Claims prior to such date and minus (b) the aggregate amount
of all Escrow Claims that have been notified in writing to the Sellers
Representative by the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement prior to
such date (whether or not such Escrow Claims have been settled but provided
such Escrow Claims are not frivolous or vexatious and contain a bona fide good
faith estimate of the quantum of the Escrow Claim to the extent reasonably
subject to estimation) and which remain outstanding (it being acknowledged and
agreed that if the aggregate amount of the Escrow Claims calculated in clauses
(a) and (b)

 



      
 

 



 

equals or exceeds $850,000, then no amount shall be paid to the Sellers under
this clause (i)); and

 



 

(ii) on the expiry of the Escrow Period, an amount equal to the then-existing
balance of the Escrow Account minus the aggregate amount of all Escrow Claims
that have been notified in writing to the Sellers Representative by the
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement prior to such date (whether or not
such Escrow Claims have been settled but provided such Escrow Claims are not
frivolous or vexatious and contain a bona fide good faith estimate of the
quantum of the Escrow Claim to the extent reasonably subject to estimation)
and which remain outstanding (it being acknowledged and agreed that if the

the Sellers Representative during the Escrow Period (and such Escrow Claim is
not frivolous or vexatious and contains a bona fide good faith estimate of the
quantum of the Escrow Claim to the extent reasonably subject to estimation)
but such Escrow Claim is not settled during the Escrow Period, then the
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall, in accordance with the
notification requirements of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent
to retain in the Escrow Account the lesser of:

 



 

(i) the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account; and

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to the amount of all such Escrow Claims,

 



 

and the Escrow Period shall be deemed to be extended pending settlement of all
such Escrow Claims.

 



 

 **8.7.6** Any amount retained in the Escrow Account pursuant to Clause 8.7.5
above shall remain in the Escrow Account pending settlement of the relevant
Escrow Claim. The Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall, immediately
upon the settlement of such Escrow Claim and in accordance with the
notification requirements of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay to the Purchaser the lesser of:

 



 

(i) the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account; and

 



 

(ii) an amount equal to the amount of such settled Escrow Claim;

 



 

and the then remaining balance of the Escrow Account, if any, shall be

accordance with its terms.

Indemnified Party, on the other hand, acting with the diligence of an orderly
businessman, learns of any circumstance that may give rise to an obligation of
the Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, to indemnify (such indemnifying
Party, the " **Indemnifying Party** "), other than the third-party claims to
which Clause 9.2 below refers, it shall promptly notify the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party
is a Seller) or the Purchaser, as applicable, claiming such indemnification (a
" **Loss Notice** "). Any failure to so notify or any delay in notifying the
Sellers Representative or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



 

 **9.1.2** The Loss Notice shall include (i) a description of the
circumstances that could give rise to the Loss and (ii) the amount thereof,
with a breakdown of the various elements comprising the Loss (if it can be
estimated). The Loss Notice shall be accompanied by any other supporting
documentation that the Indemnified Party deems reasonable and pertinent.

 



 

 **9.1.3** Within the thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Loss
Notice (during which period the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying
Party and its professional advisers reasonable access during normal business
hours to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Claim), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party of:

 



 

(i) the Indemnifying Partys acceptance of the Claim and the obligation to
settle the corresponding amount, as claimed by the Indemnified Party; or

 



 

(ii) the Indemnifying Partys complete or partial objection to the Claim.

Loss Notice, the Indemnifying Party has not notified the Indemnified Party of
its reply, it will be deemed to have accepted the Claim outright.

 



 

 **9.1.5** In the case envisaged in Clause 9.1.3(i) above, the corresponding
amount shall be settled in accordance with Clause 8.6.

 **9.2.1** In the event of any claim, requirement, inspection or action by a
third party that may give rise to Losses for which an Indemnifying Party must
indemnify an Indemnified Party (hereinafter, a " **Third-Party Claim** "), the
following procedure shall be followed.

 



 

 **9.2.2** Where a Seller Indemnified Party, on the one hand, or a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, on the other hand, acting with the diligence of an orderly
businessman, learns of a Third-Party Claim that may give rise to Losses, it
shall promptly deliver a Loss Notice to the Sellers Representative (on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party is a Seller) or the
Purchaser, as applicable. Any failure to so notify or any delay in notifying
the Sellers Representative or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



 

 **9.2.3** The Loss Notice shall include: (i) a description of the
circumstances that could give rise to the Loss and (ii) the amount claimed
with a breakdown of the various elements of which it is comprised (if this can
be estimated). The Loss Notice shall be accompanied by any supporting
documentation that is reasonably necessary to evaluate the Third Party Claim
and the amount claimed.

 



 

 **9.2.4** Within the twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of the Loss
Notice or, if there is a shorter procedural or legal term in which to reply to
the Third-Party Claim, before two-thirds of that term have elapsed, the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party:

 



 

(i) if the Indemnifying Party refuses to accept the Losses arising from the
Third-Party Claim; or

 



 

(ii) if the Indemnifying Party accepts such Losses, in whole or in part.

 



 

If the Indemnifying Party fails to reply, it shall be deemed that the Losses
arising from the Third-Party Claim have been accepted outright.

 



 

 **9.2.5** In the case referred to in Clause 9.2.4(i) above, or in the event
that the Indemnifying Party does not reply within the agreed time period, the
Indemnified Party may, acting in good faith, take any such defensive action as
it may deem appropriate, including a settlement in or out of court or an
agreement.

 



 

In all cases, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to be kept informed of
the progress of the claim in question and shall have reasonable access to all
the information and documentation regarding the same.

 



 

 **9.2.6** In the case referred to in Clause 9.2.4(ii) above, the Indemnifying
Party shall indicate in its reply whether they take on the right of defense
against the Third-Party Claim; _provided,_ however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim if
(A) such Third-Party Claim

 



      
 

 



 

relates to any criminal proceeding, action or indictment, (B) there is a
material and direct conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim (whereby the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party
Claim have direct opposed interests and/or loyalties), (C) such Third-Party
Claim is reasonably expected to result in Losses in excess of 150% of the
indemnification obligations set forth in Clause 8.4.4, (D) such Third-Party
Claim relates to Taxes and could give rise to material adverse Tax
consequences for an Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) that would not be
subject to indemnification hereunder, or (E) such Third-Party Claim is
controlled by the RandW Insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

 **9.2.7** Subject to Clause 9.2.6, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to take any such defensive action as they may deem appropriate against the
Third-Party Claim and they shall bear the expenses incurred in the defense of
the Third-Party Claim, as well as any expenses in relation to the provision or
maintenance of payments into court, security deposits or guarantees that may
have to be granted as a result of said defense in any proceeding. In all
cases, the Indemnified Party, alone or through the advisors it freely
designates, shall have reasonable access to the information and documentation
regarding the claim in question.

 



 

 **9.2.8** The Indemnified Party shall supply the information necessary for
the Indemnifying Party to take the defensive action to which Clause 9.2 refers
and shall provide the appropriate cooperation, including granting powers of
attorney or other instruments of representation to the lawyers and court
procedural representatives freely designated by the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

 **9.2.9** In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, the
Indemnifying Party or its advisors may enter into a settlement, agreement or
in any other manner reach a settlement in or out of court with the competent
public authorities or with any third party, without the express, prior and
written consent of the Indemnified Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party make
available to the Indemnified Party all the funds that they must pay the third
party pursuant to the settlement or agreement, (ii) the settlement or
agreement is solely for cash, without any admission of fault and expressly and
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from the liabilities and
obligations derived from such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the settlement or
agreement does not relate to Taxes. Any other settlement or disposition may
only be made with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

 



 

 **9.2.10** For clarity, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to reach
any settlement or out of court agreement without the prior written acceptance
by the Indemnified Party if such settlement or out of court agreement has a
material negative effect on the image or reputation of the Indemnified Party,
its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, stockholders,
managers, members, partners, employees, agents or representatives.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.2.11** In the event that the Indemnifying Party chooses not to assume the
right to take defensive action against the Third-Party Claim (in which case
the Indemnified Party may take the defensive action it deems appropriate),
alone or through the advisors they freely choose, it shall be entitled to be
reasonably informed of the progress of the claim in question and shall have
reasonable access to all the information and documentation regarding same.

 



 

 **9.3** **Determination of the obligation to provide indemnification**

 



 

Subject to Clause 8 of this Agreement, the indemnification obligations shall
be governed by the following:

 



 

 **9.3.1** With respect to the direct Claims envisaged in Clause 9.1 of this
Clause, the payment obligation arising from the indemnification undertakings
contained hereunder shall be enforceable against the Indemnifying Party where
there is (i) an agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party regarding the suitability and amount to be indemnified, or (ii) from the
existence of a final arbitral award pursuant to Clause 12.10.

 



 

 **9.3.2** With respect to Third-Party Claims envisaged in Clause 9.2 of this
Clause, the payment obligation arising from the indemnification undertakings
hereunder shall be claimable once there is (i) an agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party regarding the suitability and
amount to be indemnified, (ii) a final arbitral award pursuant to Clause 12.10
or (iii) in the event that the Indemnifying Party accept that the Third-Party
Claim may give rise to Losses and fully assume such Losses, said payment
obligation shall also be enforceable once there is a final judgment, decision,
award or administrative act in relation to the Third-Party Claim.

 



 

 **9.4** **R andW Insurance Policy**

 



 

 **9.4.1** Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, to the extent an
Indemnifying Partys exercise of rights under this Clause 9 is inconsistent
with or could otherwise prejudice Purchasers ability to obtain coverage
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to exercise such control or similar rights.

 



 

 **10** **Confidentiality; Restrictive Covenants**

 



 

 **10.1** _Announcements_

 



 

No announcement, communication or circular in connection with the existence or
the subject matter, terms or conditions of this Agreement shall be made or

shall not affect any announcement, communication, or circular required by
Applicable Law or any Governmental Entity or the rules of any stock exchange
on which the shares of either Party or holding company are

or communication or issue a circular (or whose holding company has such an
obligation) shall consult with the other Parties (or shall procure that its
holding company consults with the other Parties) insofar as is reasonably
practicable and permitted by Applicable Law before complying with such an
obligation to the extent such announcement, communication or circular is not
consistent with previous public disclosures by the Parties related to the
Transaction.

 



 

 **10.2** _Confidentiality_

 



 

 **10.2.1** Subject to Clauses 10.1 and 10.2.3, commencing as of the date

Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the restrictions
set forth in Clause 10.2.1(iii) shall cease to apply to the Purchaser and its
Affiliates with respect to any information relating to the business, financial
or other affairs (including future plans and targets) of the Group Companies.

 



 

 **10.2.2** Subject to Clause 10.2.3, from and after the Closing and for a
period of five years after the Closing Date, each of the Sellers shall, and

other affairs (including future plans and targets) of a Group Company.

 



 

 **10.2.3** Clauses 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 shall not prohibit disclosure or use of
any information if and to the extent:

 



 

(i) the disclosure or use is required by Applicable Law, any Governmental
Entity or the rules of any stock exchange on which the shares of any Party or
its holding company are listed (including, with respect to Parent, in any
periodic report by Parent filed with the SEC);

 



 

(ii) the disclosure or use is required to vest the full benefit of this
Agreement in the Sellers or the Purchaser;

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) the disclosure or use is required for the purpose of any judicial or
arbitration proceedings arising out of this Agreement or any other agreement
entered into under or pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) the disclosure is made to a Tax Authority in connection with the Tax
affairs of the disclosing Party or its Affiliates;

 



 

(v) the disclosure is made to a Person to whom assignment is permitted under
Clause 12.4.2 on terms that such assignee undertakes to comply with the
provisions of Clause 10.2.1 or 10.2.2, as applicable, in respect of such
information;

 



 

(vi) the disclosure is made to professional advisers or actual or potential
financiers of any of the Sellers, or any Affiliate of the Sellers, or the

professional advisers or financiers undertake to comply with the provisions of
Clause 10.2.1 in respect of such information;

 



 

(vii) the disclosure is required for ordinary course reporting purposes to the
Sellers or any of its Affiliates current, former or prospective investors;

know the information for the purposes of considering, evaluating, advising on
or furthering the potential purchase and on terms that such professional
advisers or financiers undertake to comply with the provisions of Clause
10.2.1 or 10.2.2, as applicable, in respect of such information;

 



 

(x) the disclosure is made by a Seller in the ordinary course of his/her

provided that prior to disclosure or use of any information pursuant to Clause
10.2.3(i), (ii) or (iii), the Party concerned shall, where not prohibited by
Applicable Law, promptly notify the other Parties of such requirement with a
view to consult with the other Parties insofar as is reasonably practicable.

 



 

 **10.2.4** This Clause 10.2 shall supersede in its entirety the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated 2 March 2018, by and between Parent and the
Company.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.3** _Management Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_

 



 

 **10.3.1** Each of the Founders (the " **Non-Compete Parties** ") agrees and
acknowledges that such Non-Compete Party is familiar with the trade secrets
and other information of a confidential or proprietary nature of the Group
Companies, their business and their business relations. Each Non-Compete Party
also agrees and acknowledges that the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Group Companies after the Closing) would be irreparably damaged if such
Non-Compete Party were to provide services or to otherwise participate in the
operations or business of any Person competing with the Business and that any
such competition would result in a significant loss of goodwill by the
Purchaser. Each Non-Compete Party further agrees and acknowledges that (i) the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Clause 10.3 were a material
inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder, and that the Purchaser and its Affiliates would not
obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically
negotiated by the Parties if such Non-Compete Party breached any of the
provisions of this Clause 10.3, and (ii) in order to assure the Purchaser that
the Company Groups business and the Shares will retain their value, it is
necessary that each Non-Compete Party undertake not to utilize his special
knowledge of the businesses of the Group Companies and such Non-Compete
Partys relationship with clients or customers to compete with the Business
during the Non-Competition Period.

 



 

 **10.3.2** Therefore, in further consideration of the substantial amounts to
be paid hereunder in exchange for each Non-Compete Partys sale of all of the
Shares held by such Non-Compete Party, and the goodwill of the businesses of
the Group Companies sold in connection therewith, each Non-Compete Party
agrees that from and after the Closing and continuing for three (3) years from
the Closing Date (the " **Non-Competition Period** "), such Non-Compete Party
shall not, and shall cause each of such Non-Compete Partys Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, either for himself or through any other Person, as an
employee, agent, consultant, director, equityholder, manager, co-partner or in
any other individual or representative capacity, own, operate, manage,
control, engage in, invest in, be employed by or participate in any manner in,
act as a consultant or advisor to, render services for (alone or in
association with any Person), permit such Non-Compete Partys name to be used
by any enterprise that engages in or participates in, or otherwise assist any
Person that engages in or owns, invests in, operates, manages or controls any
venture or enterprise that directly or indirectly engages or proposes to
engage anywhere in the world (the " **Territory** ") in the Business. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to prevent a Non-Compete Party from making
passive investments in the stock of any entity listed on a national securities
exchange or traded in the over the counter market so long as such Non-Compete
Party is not involved in the business of such entity and such Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Compete Party does not own more than two percent (2%) of the equity of such
entity.

 



 

 **10.3.3** Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Clause
10.3.2, each Non-Compete Party hereby agrees that during the Non-Competition
Period such Non-Compete Party will not, and shall cause each of such Non-
Compete Partys Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, through another
Person, as employee, agent, consultant, director, equityholder, manager, co-
partner or in any other capacity, without the Purchasers prior written
consent, (i) solicit business from any Person which is or was a client,
customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of a Group
Company during the one (1) year period preceding the Closing, or from any
successor in interest to any such Person, in any case for the purpose of
securing business or contracts related to the Business or (ii) encourage,
initiate or participate in discussions or negotiations with, provide any
information to any Person which is or becomes an acquisition target, client,
customer, supplier, licensee or licensor of the Business (including any Person
engaged in discussions with a Group Company related to such Person becoming a
client, customer, supplier, licensee or licensor of the Business) with respect
to the termination or other alteration of such Persons relationship (or
potential relationship) with the Purchaser, a Group Company or the Business.

 



 

 **10.3.4** During the Non-Competition Period, each Non-Compete Party shall
not, and shall cause each of such Non-Compete Partys Affiliates and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, as employee, agent,
consultant, director, equityholder, manager, co-partner or in any other
capacity, without the Purchasers prior written consent, employ, engage,
recruit, entice away or solicit for employment or engagement (other than by a
general solicitation advertisement, posting or similar job solicitation
process not targeting the employees of a Group Company), any Person who is (or
was during the one (1) year period preceding the Closing) employed or engaged
by a Group Company with respect to a Group Companys business, or otherwise
seek to interfere with, influence or alter any such Persons relationship with
any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **10.3.5** Each Non-Compete Party recognizes that the territorial, time and
scope limitations set forth in this Clause 10.3 are reasonable and are
properly required to protect the Purchasers substantial investment hereunder
and for the protection of the Purchasers legitimate interest in client
relationships, goodwill and trade secrets of the Group Companies businesses,
and that such limitations would not impose any undue burden upon such Non-
Compete Party. In the event that any such territorial, time or scope
limitation is deemed to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a
Governmental Entity, the Purchaser and each of the Non-Compete Parties agree,
and each of the Non-Compete Parties submit, to the reduction of any or all of
said territorial, time or scope limitations to such an area, period or scope
as said Governmental Entity shall deem reasonable or enforceable

 



      
 

 



 

under the circumstances. If such partial enforcement is not possible in such
jurisdiction, the provision shall be deemed severed as to such jurisdiction,
and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

 



 

 **10.4** _Sponsor Non-Solicitation_

 



 

From and after the Closing and continuing for eighteen (18) months from the
Closing Date, each of the Summit Sellers (the " **Non-Solicit Parties** ")
agrees that such Non-Solicit Party shall not, and shall cause each of such
Non-Solicit Partys Affiliates and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, as employee, agent, consultant, director, equityholder, manager,
co-partner or in any other capacity, without the Purchasers prior written
consent, employ, engage, recruit, entice away or solicit for employment or
engagement (other than by a general solicitation advertisement, posting or
similar job solicitation process not targeting the employees of a Group
Company and which does not result in actually employing, engaging or enticing
away such Person), any Person who is (or was during the one (1) year period
preceding the Closing) employed or engaged by a Group Company in a senior
managerial capacity with respect to a Group Companys business, or otherwise
seek to interfere with, influence or alter any such Persons relationship with
any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **11** **Sellers  Representative**

 



 

 **11.1** Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers
Representative as its representative to act in its name and on its behalf for
all purposes under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including for the
purposes of:

 



 

 **11.1.1** sending or receiving any notice or communication in connection
with this Agreement (including the Funds Flow Allocation Schedule) and the
Escrow Agreement;

 



 

 **11.1.2** granting any consent, waiver, confirmation or approval on behalf
of the Sellers under or in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement; and

 



 

 **11.1.3** generally taking any and all other actions and doing any and all
other things provided in or contemplated by this Agreement to be performed by
the Sellers,

 



 

provided that any actions provided in or contemplated by this Agreement which
do not affect the Sellers in the Relevant Proportion, shall require the
consent of all affected parties.

 



 

 **11.2** Any decisions communicated by the Sellers Representative to the
Purchaser shall be deemed to have been validly made by the relevant Sellers
for the purposes of this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall be entitled to
rely on the exercise of the powers and authorities conferred on the Sellers
Representative hereunder. Any decisions affecting more than one Seller shall
always be communicated to the Purchaser via the Sellers Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

 **12** **Other Provisions**

 



 

 **12.1** _Transfer Restrictions; Registration Rights_

 



 

 **12.1.1** _Transfer Restrictions_

 



 

(i) The Sellers understand that the Issued Shares shall be subject to
restrictions on resale pursuant to this Agreement and Applicable Laws and that
any certificates representing the Issued Shares or the applicable balance
account of a Seller with Parents transfer agent shall bear transfer
restrictions with the effect of the following applicable legends:

 



 

(a) "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT
AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION
THEREOF. NO SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO
THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED.";

 



 

(b) "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS,
CONDITIONS, RESTRICTIONS, RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS SET
FORTH IN A SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED 29 MAY 2018, WHICH, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF SUCH SHARES. A COPY OF THE

an effective registration statement covering the resale of such Issued Shares;
(b) following any sale of Issued Shares pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act (" **Rule 144**") (or any successor provision then in
effect); or (c) if such legend is not required under applicable requirements
of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements
issued by the staff of the SEC). The Issued Shares shall not bear the transfer
restriction set forth in Clause 12.1.1(i)(b) hereof upon the termination of
the restrictions set forth in Clause 12.1.1(iii)hereof. In addition, the
Issued Shares shall not bear the transfer restrictions set forth in Clause
12.1.1(i)(c) hereof following a sale of Issued Shares if, following a sale,
the Issued Shares are not required to carry a legend pursuant to such

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Laws referred to in clause (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(iii) During the Restricted Period, the Sellers shall not, directly or
indirectly, by operation of Applicable Law, contract or otherwise, (a) sell,
contract to sell, give, assign, hypothecate, pledge, encumber, grant a
security interest in, offer, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase
any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of any economic, voting or
other rights in or to any shares of Parent Common Stock, (b) engage in any
hedging, swap, forward contract or other similar transaction that is designed
to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or
disposition of beneficial ownership of, or a pecuniary interest in, any shares
of Parent Common Stock, including any short sale or any purchase, sale or
grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with
respect to such equity security, or (c) enter into a short sale of, or trade
in, derivative securities representing the right to vote or economic benefits
of, any shares of Parent Common Stock (clauses (a)-(c), a " **Transfer** "),
other than, in each case, pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.

 



 

(iv) "Permitted Transfer" means:

 



 

(a) a Transfer that has been approved in advance by the Board of Directors of
Parent;

 



 

(b) a Transfer to the acquiror in an acquisition (whether direct or indirect,
including by way of merger, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction) (an "
**Acquisition** ") that would result in such acquiror beneficially owning more
than fifty percent (50%) of the total outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock; or

 



 

(c) a Transfer to an Affiliate so long as such Affiliate shall agree in
writing with Parent to be bound by the provisions of this Clause 12.1.1 at the
time of such Transfer.

 



 

 **12.1.2** _Registration Rights_

 



 

(i) If the Restricted Period expires pursuant to paragraph (ii) or (iii) of
the definition of Restricted Period, from and after the expiration of the
Restricted Period, upon the written request of the Sellers Representative,
Parent shall file a registration statement to register the resale of the
Registrable Shares on a Form S-3 registration statement (or such other form
appropriate for such purpose if Parent does not meet the eligibility
requirements for use of Form S-3) under the Securities Act and use reasonable
best efforts to have such registration statement declared

 



      
 

 



 

effective and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for a
period ending on the date the Sellers and their Affiliates who have agreed to
be bound by the provisions of Clause 12.1.1 in accordance with paragraph (c)
of the definition of "Permitted Transfer" no longer hold Registrable Shares.

 



 

(ii) From and after the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to request one (1) underwritten offering of
Registrable Shares (an " **Underwritten Offering** "). In connection with any
offering of Registrable Shares in the form of an Underwritten Offering, the
managing underwriter for the offering shall be an investment banking firm of
national standing to be selected by the Parent. The Sellers Representative
shall have the right to cancel a proposed Underwritten Offering (a) at any
time prior to the commencement of marketing to investors for such proposed
Underwritten Offering and (b) after the commencement of marketing to investors
if the Sellers Representative becomes aware of material non-public
information relating to Parent that is different from the information known to
the Sellers Representative at the time of the commencement of such marketing.
Such cancelled offering shall not be counted as an Underwritten Offering for
purposes of this Clause 12.1.2(ii). With respect to any offering of
Registrable Shares in the form of an Underwritten Offering, Parent may include
securities to be sold for the account of Parent or other Persons in such
Underwritten Offering; provided, that no securities to be sold for the account
of any Person (including Parent) other than Sellers shall be included in such
Underwritten Offering (x) if and to the extent that the managing underwriter
advises Parent in writing that the inclusion of such securities is anticipated
to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or marketability of the
Registrable Shares or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the success
of such offering and (y) unless the Registrable Shares receive priority over
all other securities included in such Underwritten Offering. In connection
with the exercise of any registration rights granted pursuant to this Clause
12.1.2(ii), Parent may condition participation in such offering on the Sellers
entering into an underwriting agreement in customary form and acting in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof and delivering other
documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement,
including using all commercially reasonable efforts to procure customary legal
opinions, if applicable. In addition, in connection with such an Underwritten
Offering, Parent shall: (a) enter into an underwriting agreement reasonably
acceptable to Parent acting in good faith and containing such provisions as
are customary for an offering of such kind; and (b) take all such other
customary actions as the managing underwriters of such offering may

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities including (1) making members of senior management of Parent
available at reasonable times and places to participate in "roadshows" and
investor calls, (2) obtain a "cold comfort" letter in customary form as the
managing underwriters of such offering may reasonably require, (3) cause the
delivery of customary legal opinions to such underwriters in connection
therewith and (4) cooperate with counsel to the managing underwriters to
provide information requested for any filings required to be made with FINRA.

 



 

(iii) From and after the expiration of the Restricted Period, if Parent (a)
proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to a primary offering of any Parent Common Stock (except pursuant to
registrations on Form S-4 or any successor form, or on Form S-8 or any
successor form) on a form that would permit registration of Registrable Shares
for sale to the public under the Securities Act or (b) proposes to file an
initial prospectus supplement to a registration statement with respect to a
primary offering of Parent Common Stock on a form that would permit
registration of Registrable Shares for sale to the public under the Securities
Act in connection with filing such prospectus supplement, then Parent shall
give written notice of such proposed filing to the Sellers Representative not
less than twenty one (21) days before the anticipated filing date, describing
in reasonable detail the proposed offering (including the number and class of
securities proposed to be offered, the proposed date of filing of such
registration statement or prospectus supplement, any proposed means of
distribution of such securities, any proposed managing underwriter of such
securities and a good faith estimate by Parent of the proposed maximum
offering price of such securities as such price is proposed to appear on the
facing page of such registration statement or prospectus supplement), and
offering the Sellers the opportunity to register and offer such number of
Registrable Shares of the same class as those being offered by Parent as the
Sellers may request. Upon the written request of a Seller, received by Parent
no later than ten (10) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative of
the notice sent by Parent, to register and offer, on the same terms and
conditions as the securities otherwise being sold pursuant to such
registration statement or prospectus supplement, any of such Sellers
Registrable Shares of the same class as those being offered (which request
shall state the intended method of disposition thereof if the securities
otherwise being sold are being sold by more than one method of disposition),
Parent will cause such Registrable Shares as to which registration shall have
been so requested to be included in the registration statement or prospectus
supplement proposed to be filed by Parent on the

 



      
 

 



 

same terms and conditions as the securities otherwise being sold pursuant to
such registration statement or prospectus supplement (a " **Piggyback
Registration** "); provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent may at any time, in its sole discretion, without the consent of such
Seller, delay or abandon the proposed offering in which such Seller had
requested to participate pursuant to this Clause 12.1.2(iii) or cease the
filing (or obtaining or maintaining the effectiveness) of or withdraw the
related registration statement or prospectus supplement or other governmental
approvals, registrations or qualifications. In such event, Parent shall so
notify the Sellers Representative and Parent shall incur no liability for its
failure to complete any such offering.

 



 

(iv) If a Piggyback Registration is initiated, and the managing underwriter
advises Parent that in its reasonable opinion the number of equity securities
requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number that can be
sold in such offering without having a material adverse effect on the price or
success of the offering, then Parent shall include in such registration
statement or prospectus supplement the maximum number of shares that such
underwriter advises can be so sold without having such adverse effect,
allocated (a) first, to the equity securities the Company proposes to sell,
(b) second, to management of Parent, any other shareholder of Parent (other
than the Sellers) with piggyback registration rights entitling it to include
shares of Parent Common Stock and to the Sellers, pro rata among each of the
foregoing on the basis of the percentage of the then outstanding shares
requested to be registered by them, and (d) third, among other security
holders of Parent.

 



 

(v) Parent may, by notice in writing to the Sellers Representative (a "
**Suspension Notice** "), postpone the filing or effectiveness of any
registration requested pursuant to this Clause 12.1.2 (including any post-
effective amendments thereto), or otherwise suspend the registration rights of
the Sellers and/or require the Sellers to suspend use of any resale prospectus
for any period of time determined by Parent if there shall occur a Material
Disclosure Event (such period, a " **Suspension Period** "). The Sellers agree
that, upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, the Sellers will forthwith
discontinue any disposition of Registrable Shares or any public sale or
distribution until the earlier of (a) the expiration of the Suspension Period
and (b) the Sellers Representatives receipt of a notice from Parent to the
effect that such suspension has terminated. Parent covenants and agrees that
it will not deliver a Suspension Notice with respect to a Suspension Period
unless Parents employees, officers and directors are also prohibited by
Parent for the duration of such Suspension Period from effecting any public
sales of shares of Parent Common Stock beneficially

 



      
 

 



 

owned by them. In the event of a Suspension Notice, Parent shall, promptly
after such time as the related Material Disclosure Event no longer exists,
provide notice to the Sellers Representative that the Suspension Period has
ended, and take any and all actions necessary or desirable to give effect to
the Sellers rights under this Clause 12.1.2 that may have been affected by
such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Suspension Period shall not
exceed a period of 45 days, and there shall be no more than 2 such Suspension
Periods in any 12-month period.

 



 

(vi) All expenses, other than Selling Expenses (as defined below), incurred in
connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to this
Clause 12.1.2 with the SEC and FINRA, printers and accounting fees, and fees
and disbursements of counsel for Parent, shall be borne and paid by Parent.
All Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Sellers; or if there are other
selling shareholders with shares being registered pursuant to such
registration statement, then pro rata by the selling shareholders based on the
number of shares sold by such selling shareholder in the offering.

 



 

(vii) For purposes of this Clause 12.1.2,

 



 

(a) " **Material Disclosure Event** " means, as of any date of determination,
any public disclosure of material non-public information that, in the good
faith judgment of Parents Board of Directors (I) would be required to be made
in any registration statement or report filed with the SEC by Parent so that
such registration statement or report would not be materially misleading; (II)
would not be required to be made at such time but for the filing,
effectiveness or continued use of such registration statement or report; and
(iii) Parent has a bona fide business purpose for not disclosing publicly.

 



 

(b) " **Registrable Shares** " means the Issued Shares, including, without
limitation, any shares of Parent Common Stock paid, issued or distributed in
respect of any such shares by way of stock dividend, stock split or
distribution, or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, merger or consolidation, or otherwise, but excluding shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise acquired after the date hereof, including in the
open market before or after the date hereof, provided, however, that the
Issued Shares will cease to be "Registrable Shares" (A) after such shares have
been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance
with Rule 144 or (B) upon such time as the registration statement registering
the resale of the Registrable Shares has been effective for thirty six (36)
months following the Restricted Period (regardless of whether such months are
consecutive).

 



       
 

 



 

(c) " **Selling Expenses** " means the fees and disbursements of counsel for
the Sellers (and, for the avoidance of doubt, underwriting discounts or
commissions).

 



 

(viii) With a view to making available to the Sellers the benefits of Rule
144, during the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, the
Company covenants that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) file
in a timely manner all reports and other documents required, if any, to be
filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted thereunder and (b) make available information necessary to
comply with Rule 144 with respect to resales of the Issued Shares under the
Securities Act, at all times, to the extent required from time to time to
enable the Sellers to resell such shares without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (I) Rule
144 (if available with respect to resales of such shares), as such rule may be
amended from time to time, or (II) any other rules or regulations now existing
or hereafter adopted by the SEC.

 



 

(ix) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller Indemnified Party against any Losses arising out of or
based upon any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material
fact contained in any prospectus, offering circular, any amendments or
supplements thereto, "issuer free writing prospectus" (as such term is defined
in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) or other document (including any related
registration statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such
registration, qualification, or compliance, or based on any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any
violation by Parent of the Securities Act, any state securities law, or any
rule or regulation thereunder applicable to Parent, in each case, in
connection with this Clause 12.1.2, and Parent will pay to the Seller
Indemnified Parties any legal or other reasonable and documented expenses
incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or
proceeding from which such Losses may result, as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Clause
12.1.2(ix) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or
proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, nor shall Parent be
liable to any particular Seller Indemnified Party for any Losses to the extent
that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

such Seller Indemnified Party expressly for use in connection with such
registration.

 



 

(x) Promptly after receipt by a Seller under this Clause 12.1.2 of notice of
the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a
Seller Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, the
Seller Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against Parent under this Clause 12.1.2, give Parent notice of the
commencement thereof. Parent shall have the right to participate in such
action and, to the extent Parent so desires, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel mutually satisfactory to the Seller Indemnified Parties;
provided, however, that the Seller Indemnified Parties shall have the right to
retain one separate counsel for all such Seller Indemnified Parties, with the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses to be paid by Parent, if (i) the
Seller Indemnified Parties reasonably object to such assumption on the grounds
that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in
addition to those available to Parent, (ii) the Seller Indemnified Parties and
Parent shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (iii) in
the reasonable opinion of the Seller Indemnified Parties, representation of
such party by the counsel retained by Parent would be inappropriate due to an
actual or potential conflict of interest between such party and Parent in such
proceeding. The failure to give notice to Parent within a reasonable time of
the commencement of any such action shall not relieve Parent of any liability
to the Seller Indemnified Parties under this Clause 12.1.2, unless and only to
the extent that such failure materially prejudices Parents ability to defend
such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to give notice to
Parent will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Sellers
otherwise than under this Clause 12.1.2. Parent shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Seller Indemnified Parties, effect any settlement of
any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Seller
Indemnified Parties is or could have been a party and indemnity could have
been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of the Seller Indemnified Parties from all
liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

 



 

(xi) To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under
the Securities Act in any case in which contribution under the Securities Act
may be required on the part of the Seller Indemnified Parties, then such
parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Parent and
each Seller Indemnified Party in connection with the statements,

 



      
 

 



 

omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage,
liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of Parent and each Seller Indemnified Party
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged
omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by Parent or by
such Seller Indemnified Party and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission; provided, however, that, in any such case (x) a Seller will not be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of
all such Registrable Shares offered and sold by such Seller pursuant to such
registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

(xii) This Clause 12.1.2 shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force and effect with respect to each Seller at such time as such Seller
ceases to hold any Registrable Securities, except that the provisions of
paragraphs (ix),(x), (xi) and (xii) of this Clause 12.1.2 shall survive for
any sales of Registrable Securities prior to such date.

 



 

 **12.2** _Books and records_

 



 

The Purchaser undertakes to the Sellers that it shall, and shall procure that
each member of the Purchasers Group shall, to the extent consistent with the
Group Companies existing document retention policies and procedures, preserve
for a period of at least seven (7) years from the Closing Date all books,
records and documents of or relating to the Company and each of Group
Companies existing at Completion (together the " **Books and Records** "). The
Purchaser shall during such period, upon being given reasonable notice, permit
each Seller and its professional advisers to inspect and to make copies of, at
such Sellers cost, any Books and Records to the extent requested by such
Seller for a reasonable business purpose.

 



 

 **12.3** _Further Assurances_

 



 

Each of the Parties shall, and shall make all commercially reasonable efforts
to procure that any necessary third party shall, from time to time execute
such documents and perform such acts and things as either of them may
reasonably require to transfer the Shares to the Purchaser and to give the
other the full benefit of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.4** _Whole Agreement_

 



 

 **12.4.1** This Agreement contains the whole agreement between the Parties
relating to the sale and purchase of the Shares to the exclusion of any terms

 **12.5.2** Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to, without the consent of the other Parties, (i) assign any of its
rights and obligations to any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Purchaser
so long as such assignment does not delay or impede the consummation of the
Transactions or (ii) pledge for any valid means under the Applicable Laws,
fully or partially, its rights and obligations under this Agreement in favour
of its creditors in relation to the debt acquisition financing. In case such
rights and obligations are finally pledged by the Purchaser, the Sellers
undertake to cooperate in good faith and carry out those actions which are
necessary for the implementation of the pledge; provided that no such
assignment or pledge described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall
relieve the Purchaser of any obligation hereunder.
