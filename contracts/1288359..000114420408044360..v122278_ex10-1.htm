Business or in which any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries claim any 
ownership rights: (i) all trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade
dress,  domain names and other indicia of origin, and all registrations and
pending  applications to register any of the foregoing (collectively,

intellectual property, whether to  or  by any Company or any Subsidiary (for
this purpose, excluding so-called "off-the-shelf" products and "shrink wrap"
software licensed to any of the  Companies or Subsidiaries in the Ordinary
Course of Business and easily  obtainable without material expense); and (v)
all Software developed by any  Company or any Subsidiary. The rights required
to be so identified, together  with all proprietary know how and trade

(b) _Ownership  of Intellectual Property_.  Either  a Company and/or a
Subsidiary has the sole, exclusive and irrevocable title  to,  or is duly
authorized to use, the Intellectual Property, and, except for as  set  forth
on _Schedule  3.12_ ,  has not  granted any liens, mortgages or
encumbrances thereon or thereto. The  Intellectual Property is valid and
enforceable and has been maintained in good  standing, and no Company or
Subsidiary has undertaken or omitted to undertake  any acts and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no circumstances or grounds exist,  that would
invalidate, reduce or eliminate, in whole or in part, the  enforceability or

,  there  are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, claims
(whether  orally or in writing), that any Company or Subsidiary has
infringed,  misappropriated, diluted or violated any intellectual property
rights of any  third party. The use of the Intellectual Property by any
Company or Subsidiary  has not and does not infringe upon, misappropriate,
dilute or violate the  intellectual property rights of any third party. To
the Knowledge of Seller,  (i)  the Intellectual Property has not been and is
not being infringed,  misappropriated, diluted or violated by any third party
and, (ii) no  circumstances or grounds exist that would indicate that the
Intellectual  Property is about to be so infringed, misappropriated, diluted
or violated.

the-shelf" products and "shrink wrap" software  licensed to any of the
Companies or Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of  Business and easily
obtainable without material expense). Either a Company  and/or a Subsidiary
currently owns or licenses, or otherwise have the legal  right to use, all of

in compliance with applicable licenses or other  agreements.

together with the Communications, Licenses and the State Licenses the "
**Regulatory  Permits** ");  in  each case that are required for the

Regulatory Permits would not have a Material  Adverse Effect. _Schedule 
3.13(a)(ii)_   sets  forth a true, correct and complete list of all of the
Communications Licenses  and correctly specifies the expiration date of each
Communications License  in  effect as of the Agreement Date. No Company is
required to obtain or hold in  its  own name any Communication Licenses in
order for its Subsidiaries to conduct  business as presently conducted.

 

 

(b) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  3.13(b)_ ,  each of  the
Communications Licenses was duly issued, is valid and in full force and 
effect, has not been suspended, canceled, revoked or modified in any
materially  adverse manner and is not subject to conditions or requirements
that are not  generally imposed on such authorizations.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  3.13(c)_ ,  (i)  each holder of a
Communications License is in material compliance with, and  the  conduct of
its business has been and is in material compliance with, the terms  of the
Communications Licenses, the Communications Act, and any applicable

registrations and reports that were due to be filed in the three years prior

required  by  the Communications Act, or any other applicable Communications
Laws, and all  such registrations and reports were true and correct in all
material respects;  and (iii) each such holder has paid all amounts owed to
the FCC, any State  PUC  or any municipal Governmental Entity in connection
with the grant and  maintenance of the good standing of the Communications
Licenses and no further  amounts are currently due to the FCC, any State PUC
or any municipal  Governmental Entity. Except as set forth in _Schedule 
3.13(c)_ ,  (x)  there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any
threatened action by  or  before the FCC, any State PUC, or any municipal
Governmental Entity to revoke,  cancel, suspend, modify or refuse to renew
any material Communications License,  (y) there is not now issued,
outstanding or, to the Knowledge of Seller,  threatened, any notice by the
FCC, any State PUC, or any municipal Governmental  Entity, any material
violation or complaint, or any application, complaint,  or  proceeding
(other than applications, proceedings, or complaints that generally  affect
the industry of the applicable Company or any of its Subsidiaries as  a 
whole) relating to the Business or operations of the applicable Company and 
its  Subsidiaries, and (z) to the Knowledge of Seller, no Person has asserted
in  writing to a Governmental Entity that any material Communications License
should  be modified or revoked, or that any Company or Subsidiary is not in
material  compliance with any Communications License.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Without  limiting the foregoing, each Subsidiary (i) complies in all

the implementing rules of the FCC; (ii) is capable  of providing enhanced 911

necessary pole sharing, conduit occupancy or similar agreements and is
currently  in material compliance with any and all Laws of the FCC, any State
PUC, or  any  municipal Governmental Entity with regard to the placement
and/or spacing of  telephone lines.

 

 

(e) The  regulatory tariffs applicable to the Company and each Subsidiary
stand in full  force and effect in accordance with their terms, and there is
no outstanding  notice of suspension, cancellation or termination or, to the
Knowledge of  Seller, any threatened suspension, cancellation or termination
in connection  therewith. None of the Companies nor any Subsidiary is subject
to any  restrictions or conditions applicable to its regulatory tariffs that
limit  or  would materially limit the operations of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries  (other than restrictions or conditions generally applicable to
tariffs of that  type). To the extent that regulatory approvals are required
under the  Communications Laws, each such tariff has been duly and validly
approved by  the  appropriate regulatory agency. None of the Companies nor
any Subsidiary is  in  violation under the terms and conditions of any such
tariff, and there is no  basis for any claim of violation by any Company or
Subsidiary under any such  tariff.

 

 

**3.14** **Real  Property**.

 

 

(a) _Schedule  3.14_   contains  a list of all Real Property.

impair the use thereof in a manner which it is now operated by such Company 
or  Subsidiary.

 

 

(c) To  the  Knowledge of Seller, there is no Law, that would require any
material  expenditure by any Company or any Subsidiary to modify or improve
any of the  Real Property to bring it into compliance therewith that would
have a Material  Adverse Effect.

 

 

**3.15** **Leases**.  _Schedule  3.15_   contains  a list of all material
leases pursuant to which any of the Companies or any  of  the Subsidiaries
leases from a Person other than a Company or a Subsidiary,  as  lessor or

previously been made available to the Buyer.  All of the Leases are valid,
binding and enforceable against the applicable  Company or Subsidiary and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, against the other parties  thereto, in accordance to
their respective terms, and there is not under any  such Lease any existing
default by the applicable Company or Subsidiary, or  by  any other party
thereto, or any condition or event that, with notice or lapse  of  time or
both, would constitute a default. None of the Companies nor any of  the 
Subsidiaries has received notice that the lessor of any of the Leases
intends  to  cancel, suspend or terminate such Lease or to exercise or not
exercise any  option thereunder. For purposes of inclusion on _Schedule 
3.15_ ,  a Lease  shall be deemed material if it is a lease for real
property or if it requires  the payment by, or to, a Company or its
Subsidiaries of $25,000 or more during  any twelve (12) month period for
tangible personal property.

cause such a default  under) any of the Contracts, or (ii) has waived any
right it may have under  any  of the Contracts. All of the Contracts

been determined by the IRS to meet such requirements in a favorable 
determination letter or opinion letter, and such determination or opinion
letter  has not been revoked or withdrawn. No Benefit Plan is subject to
Title IV of  ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Company and its
Subsidiaries has not  engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transactions," as

Subsidiaries to any material amount  of  penalty or tax imposed under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the  Code. Each Company and its
Subsidiaries have not engaged in any transaction  described in Section 4069
of ERISA within the last five (5) years.

 

 

(b) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.21_   or  pursuant to the terms
of the Benefit Plans, neither the execution and delivery  hereof nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i)  result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation or golden  parachute)
becoming due to any director, officer of other employee of any  Company, or
(ii) increase any benefit otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan  or result
in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such  benefit,
which would require such Company to make additional contributions  to  any
Benefit Plan. Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.21_ ,  each  Benefit
Plan covers only employees who are employed by Seller or a Company 
or Subsidiary.  Neither Seller nor any Company or Subsidiary, nor any other
corporation or  organization controlled by in  common  control with the
forgoing within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA has at  any  time
contributed to any "multi-employer plan" as described in Section 413(c) of 
the Code. No employer  securities, employer real property or other employer
property is included in  the  assets of  any  Benefit Plan. Neither
Seller, nor any Company or Subsidiary have any obligation  to contribute to
or any liabilities  with respect to a "defined benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA,  or a pension  plan subject to the funding standards
of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412  of  the Code.  There are no
pending, or threatened, claims, actions or proceedings of any  kind  with
respect  to any Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.21_ ,  all  contributions
required to be made by any Company or Subsidiary to any Benefit  Plan in
accordance with its terms or by Law or regulation and all premiums  due  and
payable from any Company or Subsidiary with respect to a Benefit Plan have 
been timely made.

 

 

(d) The  Seller and each Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any
liability in  respect of post-termination or post-retirement health, life,
medical or other  welfare benefits to former or current employees thereof,
except for benefits  required under Code Section 4980B or any similar state
or local  law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Each  Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the  meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code subject to Section 409A
of the Code  has been operated in good faith, reasonable compliance with
Section 409A of  the  Code since January 1, 2005 and no Company stock option
subject to Code Section  409A was granted at an exercise price less than the
fair market value (within  the meaning of Code Section 409A) of a share on
the date of grant.

 

 

(f) There  is  no action or audit by the Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty  Corporation, the IRS or any other Governmental Entity or by
any plan participant  or beneficiary pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, relating  to  the Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to  the  Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the Benefit Plans  (other  than routine claims for
benefits)  nor are  there facts or circumstances that exist that would
reasonably be expected to  give rise to any such actions.

the Companies,  any  Subsidiary, and any affiliated, combined or unitary
group of which any Company  is or was a member, as the case may be (each, a "
**Tax  Affiliate** " and,  collectively, the " **Tax  Affiliates** "), 
has  duly and  timely filed all Tax Returns, including extensions, required
to be filed by  it  in respect of any Taxes. All of such Tax Returns are
true, complete and accurate  in all material respects. The Companies and the
Tax Affiliates have duly and  timely paid all Taxes and other governmental
charges, and all interest and  penalties with respect thereto, whether or not
shown on said Tax Returns  (whether by way of withholding or otherwise) to
any federal, state, local or  other taxing authority (except to the extent
the same are being contested in  good faith and adequate reserves therefor
have been provided in the Financial  Statements).  No  deficiency for any
Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the  Companies or Tax
Affiliates that has not been resolved and paid in full (except  to the extent
the same is  being  disputed in good faith by the  relevant Company or Tax
Affiliate). No waiver, extension or comparable consent  given by any Company
or Tax Affiliate regarding the application of the statute  of limitations
with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns is outstanding, nor  is  any
request for any such waiver or consent pending. Since March 6, 2000 in  the 
case of War Holdings and its Subsidiary, June 15, 2000 in the case of Pine 
Tree  Holdings and its Subsidiaries and February 18, 2001 in the case of
Granby  Holding and its Subsidiary, none of the Companies or Subsidiaries has
been  a  member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income
Tax Return  other than a group the common parent of which is one of the 
Companies  or the  Seller. No Company or Subsidiary  (i)  is a  party to,
or bound by, or otherwise in any way obligated under, any Tax sharing  or
similar agreement;  or (ii)  has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
other than a group of which any  Company is the common parent and one or more
Subsidiaries is a member, under  Section 1.1502-6 of the United States
Treasury Regulations (or any similar  provision of state or local Law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract,  or  otherwise.  No  Company or
Subsidiary has consented to have the provisions of Section 341(f)(2)  of the
Code (or comparable state law provisions) apply to it.  There  are no Liens
for Taxes upon any assets of the Companies or the Subsidiaries,  except Liens
for Taxes not yet due. No  Company  or Subsidiary has agreed or been
requested to make any adjustment under Section  481  of the  Code by reason
of a change in accounting method or otherwise.  No  Company or Subsidiary is

premiums exceed 150% of the  annual premiums paid as of the Agreement Date
for such insurance (the " **Current  Premium** ")  and  (ii) such policies
may in the sole discretion of the Buyer be one or more tail  policies for all
or a portion of such sixty (60) month period. If such premium  for such
insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 6.8 would  at

**6.9** **Tax  Matters**. 

 

 

(a) _Liability  for Tax Matters_.  Subject  and pursuant to Article IX, the
Seller shall be liable for and pay all Taxes  of  the Companies and the
Subsidiaries for any Tax period or portion thereof ending  on or before the
Closing Date (whether assessed or unassessed) and shall  indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer (and, following the Closing, the Companies  and the
Subsidiaries), from and against all Taxes of the Companies,  the 
Subsidiaries  and/or any  affiliated, combined or unitary group of which
any Company or Subsidiary is  or  was a member for any Tax period or portion
thereof ending on or before the  Closing Date (whether  assessed or
unassessed).  The  Seller shall be entitled to any refund actually received
by (or actually  credited against the Tax liabilities of) the Buyer, any
Company or any  Subsidiary which is attributable to Taxes paid by the
Companies or any  Subsidiary for the period prior to and including the
Closing Date; provided,  however, that the Seller shall not be entitled to
any such refund (or credit)  to  the extent that such refund (or credit)
arises from or is attributable to a  Tax  attribute, Tax credit or Tax net
operating loss of the Buyer for any taxable  period; provided further that if
any such refund (or credit), or portion  thereof, is attributable to the
carryback or utilization of a Tax net operating  loss, Tax credit or any
other Tax attribute of any Company or a Subsidiary  existing on the Closing
Date, the Seller shall be entitled only to such portion  of the refund (or
credit) that is attributable to Taxes paid by any Company  or  Subsidiary on
or prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be entitled to  any  refund or
credit in respect of any Taxes applicable to the business, assets,  or 
results of operations of the Companies and Subsidiaries in each case 
attributable to all periods of time following the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) For  purposes of this Section 6.9, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on  a  periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that
includes (but does  not  end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
attributable to periods of  time up to and including the Closing Date shall
(i) in the case of any Taxes  other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to  be  the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on  the  Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire  taxable period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income  or receipts, be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the  relevant Taxable
period ended on the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) _Consistent  Tax Reporting_.  The  Buyer shall file a consolidated
federal income Tax Return that includes the  Companies and the Subsidiaries
for the taxable period of the Companies starting  with the day following the
Closing Date. Accordingly, the taxable year of each  of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries will close for federal income Tax purposes  at the end of the
day on the Closing Date. No election under Section 338 of  the  Code
(relating to stock purchases treated as asset acquisitions) or under Reg. 
Sec.1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation elections) shall be 
made. The Companies and the Subsidiaries shall not engage in any
transactions  on  or prior to the Closing Date outside the ordinary course
of business other  than  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Seller, the Companies,  the  Subsidiaries, and the Buyer shall (i) treat
and report the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in all respects
consistently with the provisions  of this Agreement for purposes of any
federal, state, local or foreign Tax  and  (ii) not take any actions or
positions inconsistent with the obligations of  the  parties set forth
herein.

(d) _Tax  Returns for Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. 
The  Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed  all  Tax Returns of the Companies and Subsidiaries for taxable
periods ending on  or  before the Closing Date that have not been filed
prior to the Closing Date.  The  Seller shall permit the Buyer to review and
comment on each such Tax Return  described in the prior sentence at least ten
(10) days prior to filing and  shall  make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the  Buyer. None of the Companies or
any Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return for  any Tax Period ending on or
before the Closing Date without the written consent  of Seller, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. All Tax Returns  prepared by or for
the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be prepared  in  a manner
consistent with the past practice of the applicable Company or  Subsidiary,
except as otherwise reasonably necessary to comply with  Law.

 

 

(e) _Tax  Returns for Tax Periods that Include but do not End on the
Closing  Date_.  The  Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed in  a  timely manner all Tax Returns of the Companies
and Subsidiaries for taxable  periods that include but do not end on the
Closing Date. The Company shall  permit the Seller to review and comment on
each such Tax Return described in  the  prior sentence at least ten (10)
days prior to filing and shall make such  revisions to such Tax Returns as
are reasonably requested by the Seller. None  of  the Companies or any
Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return for any such Tax  Period without the
written consent of the Seller, which shall not be  unreasonably withheld. All
Tax Returns to be prepared by or for a Company  pursuant to this Section 6.9

applicable Company or Subsidiary, except as otherwise  reasonably necessary
to comply with Law.

 

 

(f) _Reimbursement;  Notice_.  Each  Party shall promptly pay the other for
any Taxes for which such Party is liable  under this Section 6.9, but in no
event later than five days prior to the due  date of the payment of such
Taxes. The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith  to resolve any disputes
regarding the payment of any Taxes pursuant to this  Section 6.9. Within a
reasonable period of time prior to the payment of any  such  Tax, the Party
paying such Tax shall give written notice to the other Party  of  the Tax
payable and the portion that is the liability of such Party, although 
failure to do so shall not relieve the other Party from its liability 
hereunder.

 

 

(g) _Assistance  and Cooperation_.  After  the Closing Date, each Party
shall (and shall cause its respective affiliates,  representatives, and
agents to): (i) assist the other Party in preparing any  Tax  Returns that
such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in  accordance with
this Section 6.9; (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any  audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns  described in
this Section 6.9; and (iii) make available to the other Party  and  to any

(i) no  claim  shall be made unless, and only to the extent that, the
cumulative amount of  Losses incurred by the Buyer exceeds $250,000;

 

 

(ii) indemnification  payments by Seller hereunder shall not exceed in the
aggregate $6,300,000; 

 

 

(iii) no  claim  shall be made with respect to Losses arising out of any
breach (or facts  constituting a breach) of this Agreement that, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, exist  prior to the Agreement Date;

 

 

(iv) no  claim  shall be made with respect to Losses arising out of any
breach of  representations or warranties in _Article  III_   or the 
covenants in _Article  VI_   to the  extent that a corresponding reserve
for such Losses has been made on the Balance  Sheet or to the extent such
amount is reflected in the Current Liabilities  that  are used to compute
the Net Working Capital; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) no  claim  shall be made for consequential damages, punitive or
exemplary damages, special  damages, lost profits, incidental damages,
indirect damages, unrealized  expectations or other similar items.

 

 

In  determining the foregoing thresholds and in otherwise determining the
amount  of  any Losses for which the Buyer is entitled to assert a claim for
indemnification  hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be determined
after deducting  therefrom the amount of (a) any insurance proceeds that may
be received by  the  Buyer or any Company or Subsidiary upon the timely
submission of claims in  respect thereof and after giving effect to any
applicable deductible or  retention (which recoveries the Buyer agrees to
use, or to cause such Company  or  such Subsidiary to use, diligent efforts
to obtain) and (b) any other third  party recoveries received by the Buyer, a
Company or a Subsidiary in respect  of  such Losses (which recoveries the
Buyer agrees to use, or to cause such Company  or such Subsidiary to use,
diligent efforts to obtain). If an indemnification  payment is received by
the Buyer, and the Buyer, a Company or a Subsidiary  later  receives
insurance proceeds and other third party recoveries in respect of  the 
related Losses, the Buyer shall immediately pay to the Seller a sum equal to 
the  lesser of (y) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds and other
third  party  recoveries or (z) the actual amount of the indemnification
payment previously  paid by the Seller with respect to such Losses.

 

 

**9.3** **Indemnification  of the Seller**.  Subject  to the other terms of
this _Article  IX_ ,  from  and after the Closing, the Buyer agrees to
indemnify the Seller and hold the  Seller harmless against and in respect of
any and all Losses which arise or  result from: (a) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties of  the  Buyer contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant  to  this Agreement or (b) the failure
of the Buyer to perform any of its covenants  or agreements set forth herein.

 

 

**9.4** **Procedure  for Indemnification**. 

 

 

(a) Any  Party  entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder shall
promptly notify  the  indemnifying Party of the claim in writing upon
learning of such claim or the  facts constituting such claim, describing the
claim in reasonable detail, the  amount thereof, and the basis therefor. The
indemnifying Party will be relieved  of its indemnification obligations
hereunder to the extent that it is prejudiced  by the indemnified party's
failure to give such prompt notice. The Party from  whom indemnification is
sought shall respond to each such claim within thirty  (30) days of receipt
of such notice. No action shall be taken pursuant to the  provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise by the Party seeking indemnification  (unless
reasonably necessary to protect the rights of the Party seeking 
indemnification) until the later of (i) the expiration of the thirty (30)
day  response period or (ii) thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
thirty  (30) day response period if a response, received within such thirty
(30) day  period by the Party seeking indemnification, requests an
opportunity to cure  the  matter giving rise to indemnification (and, in
such event, the amount of such  claim for indemnification shall be reduced to
the extent so cured).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If  a  claim for indemnification hereunder is based on a claim by a
third party, the  indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
entire control of the  defense thereof, including at its own expense,
employment of counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the indemnified Party, and,
in connection therewith, the Party  claiming indemnification shall cooperate
fully with the indemnifying Party  and  make available to the indemnifying
Party all pertinent information under its  control; _provided_ ,  that  the
indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its 
choice at its expense. In such event, the indemnifying Party shall have the 
right to settle or resolve any such claim by a third party; _provided_ , 
that  any such settlement or resolution contemplated by the Seller, as the 
indemnifying Party, that involves any action by the Buyer other than
compliance  with customary obligations to limit disclosure of the terms
thereof and the  payment of money (which is paid in full by the Seller,
subject to the applicable  conditions and limits contained in this _Article 
IX_ )  shall  not be concluded without the prior written approval of the
Buyer, which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and _provided  further_ ,  that  any such settlement or
resolution contemplated by the Buyer, as the indemnifying  Party, that
involves any action other than compliance with customary obligations  to
limit disclosure of the terms thereof and the payment of money (which is 
to  be paid in full by the Buyer) shall not be concluded without the prior
written  approval of the Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld,  delayed or conditioned.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer will, and
will cause  employees of the Buyer, the Companies and the Subsidiaries to,
cooperate fully  with the Seller in connection with any matter for which the
Seller is the  indemnifying Party. Such cooperation shall include (i)
assisting in the  collection and preparation of discovery materials, (ii)
meeting with (and making  employees available to meet with) the Seller and/or
its counsel to prepare  for  and/or appear as witnesses at depositions,
court proceedings and/or trial,  and  (iii) providing to the Seller and/or
its counsel all information under the  control of the Buyer, any Company or
any Subsidiary that is deemed necessary  by  the Seller and/or its counsel
for the defense or prosecution of such  matter.

 

 

**9.5** **Remedies  Exclusive**.  The  remedies provided in this _Article 
IX_   shall be  the exclusive remedies of the Parties hereto and their
heirs, successors and  assigns after the Closing in connection with the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement, including any breach or non-
performance of any representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, except (i) in the case of  actual fraud, in which case the defrauded
Party shall have all rights and  remedies available under this Agreement and
available under the law against  the  Party that committed such actual fraud
and (ii) specific performance of  post-Closing covenants. Without limiting
the foregoing, the sole source of  payment for any indemnification
obligations of the Seller shall be the Escrow  Amount held by the Escrow
Agent; provided that claims based on actual fraud  shall not be limited to
the Escrow Amount. No Party may commence any suit,  action or proceeding
against any other Party hereto with respect to the subject  matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in  contract, tort
or otherwise, except to bring a claim (a) to enforce such Party's  express
rights under Section 6.9 or this _Article  IX_ ,  (b) for  actual fraud
against the Party that committed such actual fraud or (c) specific 
performance of post-Closing covenants. The provisions of this _Article  IX_
  constitute an integral part of the consideration given pursuant to this 
Agreement and were specifically bargained for and reflected in the total
amount  of the Final Purchase Price payable to the Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**9.6** **Treatment  of Indemnity Payments**.  To the  maximum extent
permitted by Law, it is the intention of the Parties to treat  any 
indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Final 
Purchase Price for all purposes, and the Parties agree to file their Tax
Returns  accordingly.

 

 

**ARTICLE  X**

 

**MISCELLANEOUS**

 

 

**10.1** **Press  Releases and Public Announcements**.  Neither  Party
shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating  to 
the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of 
the  other Party; provided, however, that either Party may make any public
disclosure  it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any
listing or  trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in
which case  the  disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the
other Party prior  to  making the disclosure).

 

 

**10.2** **No  Third-Party Beneficiaries**.  This  Agreement shall not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than  the  Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided,  however, that
the provisions in Section 6.8 concerning insurance are intended  for the
benefit of the individuals specified therein and their respective legal 
representatives.

 

 

**10.3** **Agreement**.  This  Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule,
the Exhibits hereto and the  documents referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties  and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or  among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to  the  subject matter hereof (other than
the Confidentiality Agreement).

 

 

**10.4** **Succession  and Assignment**.  This  Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named  herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.  No Party  may assign either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations  hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Closing, the Buyer may 
assign and transfer to any entity providing the financing to the Buyer for 
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any refinancing of
such  financing) as collateral security for such financing all of the
Buyer's  interest, rights and remedies of such parties in, to and with
respect to this  Agreement. Each party to this Agreement and their assigns
expressly consent  to  such assignment after the Closing. Any such
assignment shall be made for  collateral security purposes only and will not
release or discharge any party  from any obligations it may have pursuant to
this Agreement, nor increase or  expand in any way Seller's obligations
hereunder. The Buyer may (a) authorize  such financing sources to assert,
either directly or on behalf of the Buyer,  any  claims such party may have
against Seller under this Agreement and (b) make,  constitute and appoint one
agent bank in respect of such financing (and all  officers, employees and
agents designated by such agent) as the true and lawful  attorney and agent-
in-fact of such party for the purpose of enabling the  financing sources to
assert and collect any such claims.

 

 

**10.5** **Counterparts**.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall  be  deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same  instrument. For purposes hereof,
facsimile copies hereof and facsimile  signatures hereof shall be authorized
and deemed effective.

under this Agreement or any documents or  instruments delivered in connection

indirect director, officer, employee, general or  limited partner or member
of the Seller or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof,  as such, whether by
the enforcement of any assessment or by an legal or  equitable proceeding, or

expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal  liability whatsoever
shall attached to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred  by any current or
future officer, agent or employee of the Seller or any current  or future

**10.9** **Privilege  and Related Matters**.  Buyer  acknowledges that the
Companies and the Subsidiaries have been represented  by  the law firms of
Choate, Hall and Stewart LLP and Kirkland and Ellis LLP  (collectively, the "
**Firms** ")  in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Parties  agree that, although the representation by the Firms
in such transactions has,  in part, nominally been of the Seller, the
Companies and the Subsidiaries,  the  true clients have been certain of the
Seller's members. As a consequence, the  Parties agree that: (i) the holder
of the privilege with respect to any  discussions with any client of either
Firm relative to such transactions on  or  prior to the Closing Date will be
the Seller and such members and no Company  or  Subsidiary shall have the
rights thereto; and (ii) that none of the Parties  hereto shall take any
action to attempt to disqualify either Firm from  representing the Seller (or
its members) in connection with any dispute relating  to this Agreement, any
related agreement or any such transactions based on  the  representation by
such Firm of any Company or Subsidiary in connection therewith  on or prior
to the Closing Date.

 

 

**10.10** **Governing  Law**.  This  Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of  the  State of Delaware without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law  provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)  that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than  the  State of
Delaware.

 

 

**10.11** **Amendments  and Waivers**.  The  Parties may mutually amend any
provision of this Agreement at any time prior  to  the Closing. No amendment
of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid  unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by each of the Parties. No waiver  by either Party of
any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or  covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to  any  prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant 
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or 
subsequent occurrence.

 

 

**10.12** **Severability**.  Any  term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any  situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability  of  the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability  of  the offending term
or provision in any other situation or in any other  jurisdiction.

 

 

**10.13** **Construction**.  The  Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this  Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation  arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties  and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either  Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.  Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall  be  deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless  the
context otherwise requires. The word "including" shall mean including 
without limitation.
