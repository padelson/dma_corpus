CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, any holder of Company Common
Shares or shares of common stock of Merger Sub or any other Person (other than
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware):

 

(i) _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the shares of common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common
Share issued immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held in
treasury or otherwise by the Company and each Company Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held
by (A) any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or (B) Parent or any of its
wholly owned Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. (A) Each Company Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(x) the Cancelled Shares, (y) the Dissenting Shares, and (z) the Company
Common Shares beneficially owned, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the Specified Stockholders) shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive $14.50

 



-4- 

    

 in cash, without interest (the " _A Merger Consideration_ "), and (B) each
Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time beneficially owned, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
any Specified Stockholder shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive $11.50 in cash, without interest (the " _B Merger Consideration_ ",
and together with the A Merger Consideration, as applicable, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

All of the Company Common Shares converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated Company Common Shares represented
by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such Company Common
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which the Company Common Shares
represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (but subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_),
Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time held by a holder who has not voted to adopt this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and is entitled to demand, and has properly
demanded, appraisal for such Company Common Shares in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Common
Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iii)_,
but at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such holder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the further
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_. All Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and any Book-Entry Shares or Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the rights of
the holder thereof under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the
further provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_. If any holder of
Dissenting Shares timely withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to
perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
under the DGCL shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares shall instead be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration only, without interest, pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(iii)_, subject to the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to setter or settle, any demands with
respect to Dissenting Shares or in relation to Section 262 of the DGCL, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the express terms of this
Agreement.

 



-5- 

    

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and
shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company
relating to the Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to or as promptly as possible
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Shares, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (but
not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the
Effective Time) (such aggregate Merger Consideration, the " _Payment Fund_ ").
If for any reason (including if any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting
shares as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_) the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Company Common Shares shall
be entitled under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iii)_, Parent shall take all steps
necessary to promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional cash with
the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this
Agreement.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the
second Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares whose Company
Common Shares were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, in the
form reasonably agreed between Parent and the Company (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon (i) surrender of
Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, or (ii) in respect of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent ( _provided_ that receipt of an "agents
message" shall be deemed to be an express acknowledgement that the holder of
such Book-Entry Shares has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the
Letter of Transmittal (and shall be deemed to have delivered and executed a
copy thereof)), in each case, together with such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any
cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
formerly representing such Company Common Shares may be paid to any such
transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably
acceptable to the Paying Agent. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share.

 



-6- 

    

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_, without interest, or, in the case
of Dissenting Shares, the rights to which a holder of Dissenting Shares may be
entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the provisions thereof and
of  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all Company Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares formerly representing Company Common Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that any such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
government; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_, and following any losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Shares at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

 

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares that has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_, without
any interest thereon.

 

(h) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of

this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be
paid in accordance with this _ARTICLE_ __ _ II_ that remains undistributed to
the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as of immediately prior to
the date on which the

 



-7- 

    

 Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto and
shall not render the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ineffective.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement , any amounts
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Prior to the Closing, the applicable
withholding agent shall (except for any employment tax withholding with
respect to amounts treated as compensation paid to employees or
any withholding as a result of the failure to deliver the certificate
required by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ of this Agreement) use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) notify the Company of any anticipated
withholding, (ii) consult with the Company in good faith to determine whether
such deduction and withholding is required under applicable Tax law, and (iii)
cooperate with the Company in good faith to minimize the amount of any
applicable withholding. 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, reasonably
acceptable to the Paying Agent, and, if required by the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or,
if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.2(g)_, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall deliver, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each
compensatory option to purchase Company Common Shares (a " _Company Option_
") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to
receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days)
following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment) with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the A Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Common
Share subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses in connection
with such payment.

received a currently effective favorable determination, opinion or

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing

any of the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

  



-38- 

    

(c) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the

and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, (A)
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including

be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other Person any non-public information for the purpose of

(other than, in response to an unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer, to
ascertain facts from the Person making such inquiry, proposal or offer for the
sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such inquiry,
proposal or offer and the Person that made it and to refer such Person to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and to limit its conversation or other communication
exclusively to such referral and such ascertaining of facts), or (C) approve,
endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse,
recommend or enter into, any Company Acquisition Agreement. Except with
respect to Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement and the Merger, and in any
case, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent, unless this Agreement has

not (x) terminate (or permit the termination of), waive or amend any
provision of the Rights Agreement (other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _

respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
and only if, at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the

from any Person that did not result from a material breach of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, and, in the case of any action described in clauses (i) through
(iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, prior to the taking of any such action,
if the 

 



-39- 

    

 Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (A) that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Superior Proposal, and (B) that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may (i)
enter into and accept an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person
that has made the Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person

_provided_ that the Company shall, substantially concurrently with the
delivery to such Person, provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to such Person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided or made available to Parent) and
(iii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in
any event, prior to (x) if any such action is taken prior to the Consent
Deadline, the Consent Deadline, and (y) if any such action is taken
subsequent to the Consent Deadline, 24 hours following the taking of any such
action) notify Parent in writing if the Company takes any of the actions in
clauses (i) through (iii) above.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than (x) if such receipt
is prior to the Consent Deadline, the Consent Deadline, and (y) if such
receipt is subsequent to the Consent Deadline, 24 hours after such receipt)
notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal,
inquiry or request for information or discussions relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries that, as determined by the Company Board in good faith, would
be reasonably likely to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer,
proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions thereof.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current
basis (but in no event more often than once every 24 hours), as to the status
of any material changes to, such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal,
inquiry or request.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or announce its intention to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case, in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve, adopt or
recommend (publicly or otherwise) to the stockholders of the Company, or
resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal, or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement
or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_) (a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ") or agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action described in clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time after the date hereof and prior to 

 



-40- 

    

 obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (x) in response to a Company Superior
Proposal actually received by the Company, or (y) in response to any Effect
(other than a Company Superior Proposal) occurring after the date hereof that
affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that was neither
known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board prior to the date
hereof, in either case, if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that, prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(1) the Company has given Parent at least three Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action specifying, in reasonable detail,
the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the information specified in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ with respect to any applicable Company Superior
Proposal ( _provided_ that, if applicable, following any subsequent revisions
to the terms of the such applicable Company Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to give Parent at least two Business Days prior written
new notice pursuant to this clause (1) and, thereafter, comply with the
further requirements of this sentence with respect to such new written
notice), (2) during such notice period, the Company shall have negotiated
with, and shall have caused its Representatives to be reasonably available to
negotiate with and to negotiate with, Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent Parents desire to negotiate to) to make any adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (3) upon the end of such
notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with independent financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that a written Company Takeover Proposal
made after the date hereof constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may, subject to compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_,
(A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ in order
to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Superior
Proposal subject to paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_; _provided_ that prior to so making a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement the Company Board
shall have complied in all material respects with the provisions of the second
sentence set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ with respect to such Company
Superior Proposal.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of the
Company Common Shares a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (it being
understood that such action (other than "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) may constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_) (if it
otherwise satisfies the definition thereof) or (ii) from making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 



-41- 

    

(h) The Company agrees that any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by any of
its Subsidiaries or its and their respective Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by the Company.

 

Section 5.4 _Written Consent; Information Statement_.

 

(a) Immediately (but in no event more than 24 hours after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the Written Consent from the Majority Stockholder and deliver the same to
Parent. The Company shall comply with applicable Law and the Companys
Organizational Documents in connection with the Written Consent, including
giving notice of the availability of dissenters rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL to the holders of Company Common Shares not executing

and of no further effect if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after delivery to the Company and
Parent of the Written Consent (but in any event, no more than 30 Business
Days following the date hereof), the Company, with the assistance of Parent
and the Majority Stockholder, shall prepare, and the Company shall file with
the SEC, the preliminary Information Statement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and the Majority Stockholder
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of

Information Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto and shall
promptly (and in any event within five days of the Companys request therefor)
furnish to the Company the information relating to Parent and Merger Sub
required by the Exchange Act for inclusion therein. Prior to filing with the
SEC, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement
and shall reasonably consider in good faith for inclusion in the Information
Statement any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel that are
provided in a timely manner. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts,
after consultation with the Majority Stockholder and Parent, to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the

form to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Shares as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Company shall notify the Majority Stockholder and
Parent promptly (and in any event no more than one (1) Business Day after) of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for any amendments or supplements to the preliminary
Information Statement or the definitive Information Statement, and the
Company, Parent and the Majority Stockholder shall cooperate in filing with
the SEC or its staff, and if required, the Company shall mail to the holders
of Company Common Shares, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such
amendment or supplement. Prior to filing with the SEC, the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to

-42- 

    

 supplements to the Information Statement and shall reasonably consider in
good faith for inclusion in any amendments or supplements any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel that are provided in a timely manner. If
at any time prior to the Closing any event shall occur, or fact or information
shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Information Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement, in consultation with and
subject to review by the Majority Stockholder and Parent as promptly as
practicable and, to the extent required by Law, cause such amendment or
supplement to be disseminated to the holders of the Company Common Shares;
_provided_ that the Company shall incorporate any and all comments received by
it from the Majority Stockholder, unless prohibited by Law, and shall
reasonably consider in good faith all comments received from Parent, Merger
Sub or their counsel. The Company shall provide the Majority Stockholder,
Parent and their respective counsel the opportunity to participate in all
discussions or meetings (whether in-person, telephonic or otherwise) with the
SEC, unless prohibited by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof, the parties shall not be required, after the date of termination, to
prepare, file and mail the Information Statement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.4(b)_.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and during the one-year period
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) base compensation and
cash and other incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no
less favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits that in the aggregate are no
less favorable than the employee benefits (excluding any equity-based
compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits)
were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the term
"Company Employees" used herein shall not include any employees of VKidz
defined as "Continuing Employees" under the VKidz Agreement whose employee
matters shall be governed by Section 4.5 thereof.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit or compensation plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in
which the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the period of
service of each Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
any predecessor thereto) prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan replaced by a Post-Closing
Plan, except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits,
_provided_ that such recognition of service shall not apply for 

 



-43- 

    

 purposes of benefit accrual under any Post-Closing Plan that is a defined
benefit retirement plan. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides
medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such
Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall (i) cause any
preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) credit each Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles
incurred by such Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms, will occur upon the Effective Time.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent. In no event shall the terms
of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained
or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable by such party under any

the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, defending any lawsuits or other legal
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger, and (v) using reasonable best efforts with
respect to the execution and delivery of all such instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes or
intent of this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in

submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party or any of its
Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
or on behalf of such party or any of its Affiliates to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties hereto with copies of

any material communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger, and permit the other parties hereto to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with,
any proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity. No
party or any of its Affiliates shall participate in any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
5.6_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the
Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall make or file, or cause to be made or filed,
as promptly as practicable, with the appropriate Governmental Entity all
filings, forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed by such
party to consummate the Merger under any applicable Antitrust Law, and

their respective Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable, respond to
inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental information
that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in connection with filings
made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall file their
notification and report forms under the HSR Act no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof. In the event that the parties receive a
request

 



-45- 

    

 for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second
Request_ "), the parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such
Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.

(e) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, knowingly take any action, or
knowingly refrain from taking any action, the effect of which would be to
delay or impede the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization,
declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, in order to permit
the satisfaction of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1(d)_ so as
to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event
before the End Date, including to (i) propose, negotiate, commit to, effect
and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of and
restriction on the businesses, assets, properties, product lines, and
equity interests of, or changes to the conduct of business of, the Company,
Parent and their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation),
(ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights
or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates, and
(iii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would limit Parents
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly
or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Parent or the Company (including any of their respective
Affiliates). If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any action
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_; _provided_ that any such
agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Without
limiting the foregoing, in no event will the Company (and the Company will not
permit any of its Affiliates to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any
such actions without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statutes_ _; Rights Agreement Amendment_.

 

(a) If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company, the Company Board, Parent and its board of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate, or otherwise minimize, the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_
shall be construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to do any act that would
constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the Companys
rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Board, as the case may be, will amend the
Rights Agreement (such amendment, the " _Rights Agreement Amendment_ "), in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to (i) render it
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) provide that it shall
have terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties hereto and that
the parties hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the
other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_  that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party issue such press release or make such public statement (a) so long
as such statements are not inconsistent with previous statements made jointly
by the Company and Parent or (b) (after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) to the extent required by applicable Law,
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange; _provided_ , _further_  that, subject to provisions of _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, the Company shall be permitted to issue press releases or make public
announcements with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or from and after
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change without being required to consult
with, or obtain the prior consent of, Parent. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall prevent any Affiliate of Parent
that is a private equity or similar investment fund, or any manager or
general partner of any such fund, from reporting or disclosing with respect to
fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting activities, on a
confidential basis, to its partners, investors, potential investors or
similar parties, general information regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case subject to customary
obligations of confidentiality with respect to non-public information such as
transaction value or other specific economic terms; _provided_ , that Parent
shall be liable for any disclosures made by the recipients pursuant to this
sentence.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers
and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
together with such Persons heirs, executors and administrators, the "
_Covered Persons_ ") against any costs and expenses (including
advancing reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any actual or threatened Proceeding or investigation
to each Covered Person to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such
Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity at
the request or for the benefit of the Company, in each case, as set forth in,
and in no event on terms less favorable than, those contained in the
Organizational Document of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary (as
applicable) in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Indemnification Arrangements_ "), subject to applicable Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless and advance expenses
to the Covered Persons for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
process resulting in and the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, as set
forth in, and in no event on terms less favorable than, those contained in
the Indemnification Arrangements, subject to applicable Law. From and after
the Effective Time, subject to any requirements and conditions of applicable
Law and the Indemnification Arrangements, Parent, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any actual or threatened
Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, except as
required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to
Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Companys Organizational Documents; _provided_ that
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that the provisions of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as set
forth in _Exhibits_ __ _ A_ and _B_ , respectively, satisfy the requirements
of this sentence. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as
required by applicable Law, if any Proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made or threatened against
such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on
or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Proceeding or investigation. Following the Effective Time,
the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with
any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any
further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms.

 



-48- 

    

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain for the benefit of the past and present directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the date hereof and as of the
Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; provided that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is available
for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time
(which the Company shall be permitted to purchase prior to the Effective
Time), which policies provide coverage to each Person currently covered by
the Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries directors and officers
liability insurance coverage in effect on the date hereof on terms that are no
less favorable than those of the Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries
directors and officers insurance coverage in effect on the date hereof for
an aggregate period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from actions and omissions that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns) without the prior written consent of any
such Covered Person, it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons
(including their respective successors and assigns) shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_. In the event of any breach
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ as such fees are incurred, upon the
written request of such Covered Person.

Section 5.10 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and subject to
the conditions described in the Commitment Letters 

 



-49- 

    

 (including, in the case of the Debt Financing, the flex provisions of any
applicable fee letters), including: (i) maintaining in effect and enforcing
the Commitment Letters and any Definitive Financing Agreements and complying
with its obligations thereunder that are a condition to the availability of
the Financing; (ii) using best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain
a waiver of ) all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements; and (iii) using
best efforts to negotiate and enter into definitive debt financing agreements
on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, in the case of the Debt Financing, any "flex"
provisions in the applicable fee letters) (the " _Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements_ ") and definitive equity financing agreements on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter (the " _Definitive
Equity Financing Agreements_ " and together with the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements, the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "). Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
and any other financing and shall give the Company prompt notice of any fact,
change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letters.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_,
prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not
permit Merger Sub to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its material
rights under, the Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing
Agreements without the Companys prior written consent; _provided_ that
Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Companys prior written consent, (i)
enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, unless there is a corresponding increase in the amount of the Equity
Financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger or the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter; or (ii) amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, agents or similar entities that had not executed the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof so long as any such addition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the
Merger or the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, but
only, with respect to _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_ , to the extent doing
so would not impose new or additional conditions or expand any existing
condition to the receipt and availability of the Debt Financing. Upon any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter", and "Definitive Debt Financing Agreement", shall
mean the Debt Commitment Letter, Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as
applicable, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or any
of the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall be
withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then Parent
shall use its best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the
same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative

 



-50- 

    

 financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and pay the Merger Consideration and the other
Merger Amounts. In the event any alternative financing is obtained in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "),
references in this Agreement to the Financing shall also be deemed to refer to
such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or
definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered
into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and
definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and
all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall
be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parents obligations with respect
to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, hereby
agrees that nothing in this Agreement requires Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, or employees to initiate a
Proceeding to seek specific performance or any other relief against any of the
Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter to cause the Debt
Financing to become available.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by
Parent or the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing,
including, but not limited to, using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
furnish Parent and Merger Sub and its Debt Financing Sources with (A) the
Required Information and (B) such other financial and pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested
in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, including information that is required in connection with the Debt
Financing as required by Governmental Entities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. PATRIOT Act of 2001 and 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230 (the " _Beneficial
Ownership Regulation_ "), as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as in
effect on the date hereof, (ii) upon reasonable advance notice, cause the
Companys senior management to participate in a reasonable number of rating
agency presentations, lender meetings and meetings with parties acting as
arrangers, bookrunners, and/or other lenders and investors for the Debt
Financing, during normal business hours, (iii) furnish existing information in
its possession regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary
to assist Parent in preparing _pro_   _forma_ financial statements, it being
understood that the Company need only assist in the preparation thereof, but
shall not be required to independently prepare any separate _pro_ _forma_
financial statements or other information, (iv) assist in the preparation of
appropriate and customary bank books, confidential information memoranda,
lender and investor presentations, ratings agency presentations and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing (including, in each
case, by participating in drafting sessions with respect thereto and provide
such other information and documents customarily provided in connection with
the Debt Financing) and execute customary authorization and
management representation letters in connection therewith, and (v) assist in
the preparation of and, in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
execute and deliver, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and
collateral documents and customary closing certificates as may be required by
the Debt Financing and including providing information reasonably necessary
for the completion of any schedules thereto. No obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents or other Representatives under any

 



-51- 

    

 certificate, document or instrument delivered pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.10(d)_ shall be required to be effective until the Effective Time. In
addition, notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ to the
contrary, in fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.10_, (i) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents or other Representatives shall be
required to (A) pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur
any Liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing or any other
financing prior to the Effective Time, (B) take or permit the taking of any
action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without lapse of time, or both)
under, the Company Organizational Documents or the organizational documents
of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any applicable Law or material contracts
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) provide any cooperation
that, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, would unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii)
Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_
(including reasonable attorneys fees) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Company
and its Subsidiaries shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by them and
their respective Affiliates with respect to the preparation, review, audit
and delivery of Required Information by the Companys independent accountants
(but excluding comfort letters, reports and opinions)). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, it is understood and agreed that
the condition precedent set forth in _Section_ __ _6.3(b)_ , as applied to
Companys obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_, shall be deemed to
be satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained as the sole
result of the Companys Willful Breach of its obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 5.10(d)_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the Financing or any other financing (including the
arrangement thereof) and any information used in connection therewith (other
than information provided to Parent in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion in any syndication materials relating to the
Financing), except in the event such loss or damage arises out of or
results from the Willful Breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) by or to Parent or any of
its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of
Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 

Section 5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly (and in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the other parties hereto in
writing of any stockholder litigation or other litigation or Proceedings
brought or threatened in writing against it or its directors or executive
officers or other Representatives relating to this Agreement, the
Merger and/or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
keep the other parties hereto informed on a reasonably current basis with
respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to the other
parties hereto and their Representatives such information relating to such
litigation or Proceedings as may be reasonably requested). In the event of any
such stockholder litigation or Proceedings brought or threatened against the
Company, the Company shall, subject to the preservation of the attorney-
client and similar privileges and

 



-52- 

    

 confidential information, give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but
not control) the defense or settlement of such stockholder litigation or
Proceedings, and shall give due consideration to Parents advice with respect
to such litigation or Proceedings; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company
shall not settle or offer to settle any such stockholder litigation or
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not have carried on any business or conducted
any operations other than as necessary, advisable or convenient to the

Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Effective Time, the Company and, following the Effective Time, Parent and the

Common Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

thereunder. Prior to taking any action under, pursuant to, or otherwise in
connection with, the VKidz Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated
thereby, including granting any consent pursuant to, or granting any waiver
of any provision of, or amending or otherwise modifying any material term of,
the VKidz Agreement (any of the foregoing, a " _VKidz Action_ "), the Company
shall consult with Parent and, to the extent applicable, provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review all documents, notices or other material
written correspondence to be delivered by the Company in connection therewith

withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall

 



-53- 

    

 reasonably consider in good faith the taking of any action pursuant to,
under or in connection with the VKidz Agreement as may be reasonably requested
in writing by Parent. The Company shall provide Parent and its
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to participate in all discussions or

the Effective Time, in each case, with no further force or effect and no
continuing obligations, monetary or otherwise, or Liabilities on the part of

is not prohibited by such Governmental Entity); (iii) any Proceeding
commenced that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ or that
could reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ to be satisfied; or (iv) the failure of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be
true or accurate in any material respects at or prior to the Closing that
would give rise to the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_; _provided_ that such written
notice shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of the Company set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ or the Company Disclosure

any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to
be true or accurate in any material respects at or prior to the Closing that

notice shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in  _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure to give such notification shall
separately constitute a failure of any condition in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VI_ or a

-64- 

    

 consummate the Merger. The Companys pursuit of specific performance at any
time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by the Company and its stockholders. In no event shall the parties
hereto be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the

in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to enforce specifically
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger unless (i) all

those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ that such conditions would have been satisfied or waived assuming
the Closing were to occur) or the failure of which to be satisfied is
proximately caused by a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) shall have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) or (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) waived; (ii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) all of the
conditions to the Companys obligations have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing; _provided_ that such conditions would have been satisfied or
waived assuming the Closing were to occur), and (B) if specific performance is
granted and the Financing is funded, then it is ready, willing and able to
take the actions within its control to cause the Closing to occur; (iii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or Parent has received written confirmations
from the counterparties to the Debt Commitment Letters that the Debt Financing
will be funded at the Closing assuming the Equity Financing is funded; and
(iv) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement. Furthermore,
for the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ shall not limit the

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, or to seek specific performance of Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger if the full amount of
the Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded at the Closing.

the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, indemnify
any other person who may be indemnified pursuant to Section 145 to the extent
the Board of Directors deems advisable, as permitted by Section 145\. The
Corporation shall promptly make or cause to be made any determination
required to be made pursuant to Section 145\.

b. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or other
entity against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person under the DGCL.

   

c. The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL, advance all costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any director or officer within 15
days of presentation of such costs and expenses to the Corporation, with
respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil or
criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the Corporation receives
from such director or officer an unsecured undertaking to repay such expenses
if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the DGCL. Such obligation
to advance costs and expenses shall include, without limitation, costs and
expenses incurred in asserting affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross-
claims to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Such undertaking to repay
may, if first requested in writing by the applicable director or officer, be
on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer;  _provided_ that in
such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party making
such undertaking.

d. No amendment to or repeal of the provisions of this Article Fifth shall
deprive a director or officer of the benefit hereof with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Fourth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are
granted subject to the right reserved in this Article Sixth; _provided_ ,

stockholder who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a waiver
of notice or who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder
attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of the meeting shall be bound
by the proceedings of the meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had
been given.

 

Section 2.06 List of Stockholders. The officer of the Corporation who has
charge of the stock ledger shall prepare a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders ( _provided_ , _however_ , if
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than
ten days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date),
arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder
and the number of shares of each class of capital stock of the
Corporation registered in the name of each stockholder at least 10 days
before any meeting of the stockholders. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, on a

for a period of at least ten days before the meeting. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and

at any meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 2.07 Quorum. Unless otherwise required by law, the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") or
these by-laws, at each meeting of the stockholders, a majority in voting power
of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present
in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. If, however,
such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, the

 



2

    

 stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the
manner provided in Section 2.04, until a quorum shall be present or
represented. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the subsequent
withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. At any such adjourned
meeting at which there is a quorum, any business may be transacted that might
have been transacted at the meeting originally called.

Section 2.08 Conduct of Meetings. At each meeting of the stockholders, the
president or, in his or her absence, any one of the vice presidents, in order
of their seniority, shall act as chairman of the meeting. The secretary or, in

plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders by the holders of
stock entitled to vote in the election. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, any matter, other than the
election of directors, brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be
decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another
person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that
it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by delivering to the secretary of the Corporation a revocation of
the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of
stockholders need not be by written ballot.

Section 2.10 Written Consent of Stockholders Without a Meeting. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, any
action required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice
and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the
action so taken, shall be signed, in person or by proxy, by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted in person or by proxy and
shall be delivered to the Corporation as required by law. Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing.

Section 2.11 Fixing the Record Date.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more
than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board
of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board
of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later
date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided, however,_ that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders
entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as
that fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote therewith
at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting: (i) when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the
first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery (by hand,
or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded; and (ii) if prior action
by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

directors and any vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors, maybe filled

Section 3.09 Notices. Subject to Section 3.06, Section 3.08 and Section 3.10
hereof, whenever notice is required to be given to any director by applicable

Section 3.10 Waiver of Notice. Whenever the giving of any notice to
directors is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these by-laws, a waiver thereof, given by the director entitled to the notice,
whether before or after such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent
to notice. Attendance by a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting except when the director attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to
the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the

secretary and all assistant secretaries, the person presiding at the meeting
may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Directors shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors.

 

Section 3.13 Action By Majority Vote. Except as otherwise expressly required

Section 3.14 Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all of the directors or
members of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission, and the writings or electronic transmissions are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee
in accordance with applicable law.

 

Section 3.15 Committees of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of
the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or
more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any
absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. If a member of
a committee shall be absent from any meeting, or disqualified from voting
thereat, the remaining member or members present at the meeting and

 



6

    

 not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
constitute a quorum, may, by a unanimous vote, appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers that
may require it to the extent so authorized by the Board of Directors. Unless
the Board of Directors provides otherwise, at all meetings of such committee,
a majority of the then authorized members of the committee shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of the
members of the committee present at any meeting at which there is a quorum
shall be the act of the committee. Each committee shall keep regular minutes
of its meetings. Unless the Board of Directors provides otherwise, each
committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal

the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice of his or her
resignation to the president or the secretary. Any such resignation shall take
effect at the time specified therein or, if the time when it shall become
effective shall not be specified therein, immediately upon its receipt.

treasurer. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed or

with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue.

Section 5.02 Transfers of Stock. Stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable in the manner prescribed by law and in these by-laws. Transfers
of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the holder of
record thereof, by such persons attorney lawfully constituted in
writing and, in the case of certificated shares, upon the surrender of the
certificate thereof, which shall be cancelled before a new certificate or
uncertificated shares shall be issued. No transfer of stock shall be valid as
against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in
the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom
transferred. To the extent designated by the president or any vice president
or the treasurer of the Corporation, the Corporation may recognize the
transfer of fractional uncertificated shares, but shall not otherwise be

issuance thereof, require the owner of the lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or the owners legal representative to give the
Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares.

ARTICLE 6 INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 6.01 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry,
administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or any other actual,
threatened or completed proceeding, including any and all appeals,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ that, except as provided in Section 6.03
with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board
of Directors.

Section 6.02 Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 6.01, an indemnitee shall, to the
fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "
_advancement of expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the DGCL
requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including,

 



9

    

 without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "
_undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a " _final
adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this Article 6 or otherwise.

Section 6.03 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 6.01
or 6.02 of this Article 6 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the
case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable
period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of
Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (b) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made
a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not
parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal
counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not
met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought
by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article 6 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 6.04 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article 6 shall not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
law, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws or otherwise.

 

Section 6.05 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

employee of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of
this Article 6 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

 

Section 6.07 Nature of Rights. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article 6 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure
to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article 6 that adversely affects any
right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall
not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

Section 6.08 Settlement of Claims. The Corporation shall not be liable to
indemnify any indemnitee under this Article 6 for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the Corporations written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any
judicial award if the Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely
opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.

 

Section 6.09 Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article 6, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required
and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including
the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

Section 6.10 Procedures for Submission of Claims. The Board of Directors may
establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 6, determination of the entitlement
of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures
shall be set forth in an appendix to these byl-aws and shall be deemed for all
purposes to be a part hereof.

behalf of the corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other

corporations stockholders, including, without limitation, a claim alleging
the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (c) any action

of this Section 7.05.
