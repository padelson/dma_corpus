 \t \t\t11.2  \t\t| The \t\trestrictions in clause 11.1 shall not prevent
any of the Warrantors \t\towning any interest in the shares or other
securities of a company \t\ttraded on a securities market provided such
interest does not extend to \t\tmore than 3 per cent. of the issued share
capital of the company or the \t\tclass of securities concerned. \t\t 
 \t \t\t11.3  \t\t| Each of the \t\trestrictions in clause 11.1 is
separate, distinct and severable and is \t\tto be construed separately from
the other restrictions and shall be \t\tenforceable independently of each of
the others and its validity shall \t\tnot be affected if any of the others is
invalid. If any of those \t\trestrictions is void but would be valid if some
part of the restrictions \t\twere deleted the restriction in question shall
apply with such \t\tmodification as may be necessary to make it valid. \t\t 
 \t \t\t11.4  \t\t| The Graphite \t\tEntities covenant (in respect of
themselves only and not in respect of \t\tany other Seller) with the Buyer
that except with the Buyer\'s written \t\tconsent the Graphite Entities shall

whether or not such \t\tperson would commit any breach of his contract of
employment or \t\tengagement by reason of so leaving the service of any Group
Company or \t\totherwise. \t\t 
 \t \t\t11.5  \t\t| Each of the \t\tWarrantors in respect of the
restrictions in clause 11.1 and the each of \t\tthe Graphite Entities in
respect of the restrictions in clause 11.4, \t\thereby acknowledges that he
considers the restrictions in clause 11.1 \t\tand in clause 11.4 respectively
to be reasonable both individually and \t\tin the aggregate and that the
duration extent and application of each of \t\tsuch restrictions are no
greater than is necessary for the protection of \t\tthe goodwill of the
businesses of the Group and that the Consideration \t\tpaid by the Buyer for
the Shares purchased from him takes into account \t\tand adequately
compensates him for any restriction or restraint imposed \t\tthereby.
However, in the event that any such restriction shall be found \t\tto be void
or unenforceable but would be valid or enforceable if some \t\tpart or parts
thereof were deleted or the period or area of application \t\treduced, each
of the Warrantors and the Graphite Entities hereby agrees \t\tthat such
restriction shall apply with such modification as may be \t\tnecessary to
make it valid. \t\t 
 \t \t\t11.6  \t\t| Without \t\tprejudice to any other rights or remedies
that the Buyer may have for \t\tthe Warrantors\' or the Graphite Entities\'
breach of this clause 11, each \t\tparty to this Agreement acknowledges and
agrees that damages alone may \t\tnot be an adequate remedy for any breach by
the Warrantors or the \t\tGraphite Entities (as the case may be) of the
provisions of this clause \t\t11, and that the remedies of injunction and
specific performance as well \t\tan any other equitable relief for any
threatened or actual breach may be \t\tmore appropriate remedies.  \t\t

each of the parties \t\tirrevocably and unconditionally waives any right or
remedy it may have \t\tto claim damages and/or to rescind this Agreement by
reason of any \t\tmisrepresentation (other than a fraudulent
misrepresentation) having \t\tbeen made to it by any person, whether or not
party to this Agreement, \t\tand upon which it has relied in entering into

paid out of the Cash Consideration \t\tdue to each of the Sellers in
accordance with this Agreement and where \t\tthe costs and expenses are to be
paid by all Sellers such costs and \t\texpenses shall be divided among the
Sellers according to each Seller\'s \t\tproportionate shareholding of the

shall pay interest on the overdue sum \t\tfor the period from and including
the due date of payment up to the date \t\tof actual payment (after as well

payee such additional amounts as will result \t\tin the receipt by the payee
of a net amount equal to the full amount \t\twhich would otherwise have been
receivable had no such deduction or \t\twithholding been required. \t\t 
   Any payment made by or due from the \t\tSellers under, or pursuant to the
terms of, this Agreement shall be free \t\tand clear of all Taxation

If any deductions or \t\twithholdings are required by law, or any payments
made by or due from \t\tthe Sellers under this Agreement are liable for
Taxation (whether in the \t\thands of the Buyer or any Group Company or
otherwise), or would have \t\tbeen liable for Taxation but for the
utilisation of any Taxation relief \t\tin respect of such liability, the
Sellers shall be liable to pay to the \t\tBuyer or the relevant Group Company
(as the case may be) such further \t\tsums as shall be required to ensure
that the net amount received by the \t\tBuyer or the relevant Group Company
(as the case may be) will equal the \t\tfull amount which would have been
received under the relevant provisions \t\tof this Agreement in the absence
of any such deductions, withholdings or \t\tTaxation liabilities. \t\t

any conditions thought fit by the \t\tgrantor. For the avoidance of doubt,
any omission to exercise, or delay \t\tin exercising, any right, power,
privilege or remedy provided by this \t\tAgreement shall not constitute a
waiver of that or any other right, \t\tpower, privilege or remedy. \t\t 
 \t \t\t19.2  \t\t| A waiver of any \t\tright, power, privilege or remedy
provided by this Agreement shall not \t\tconstitute a waiver of any other

constitute a continuing waiver of the \t\tright, power, privilege or remedy
waived or a waiver of any other right, \t\tpower, privilege or remedy. \t\t 
 \t \t\t19.3  \t\t| Any single or \t\tpartial exercise of any right,

preclude or impair any other or further \t\texercise of that or any other
right, power, privilege or remedy. \t\t

to this Agreement. The expression "variation" includes \t\tany variation,
supplement, deletion or replacement however effected. \t\t

invalid or unenforceable but \t\twould be valid or enforceable if some part
of the provision were \t\tdeleted, or the period of the obligation reduced in
time, or the range \t\tof activities or area covered, reduced in scope, the
provision in \t\tquestion will apply with the minimum modifications necessary
to make it \t\tvalid and enforceable. \t\t

 \t \t\t1  \t\t|  \t\tSubject to the provisions of this Schedule 9, if

Instrument. \t\t 
---|---

 \t \t\t5  \t\t| If \t\ta Notice of Claim has been served prior to the
Redemption Date which as \t\tat the Redemption Date remains unresolved, then
the Buyer shall be \t\tentitled, subject to paragraphs 7 to 12 inclusive, to
not redeem when \t\totherwise due a \t\tprincipal amount of Consideration
Loan Notes equal to the lesser of: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| the aggregate \t\tsum of the Relevant
Warrantors\' Proportion of the Buyer\'s Estimate of \t\teach amount claimed
pursuant to any Notice(s) of Claim received by the \t\tRelevant Warrantors
prior to the Redemption Date; and \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| the aggregate \t\tprincipal amount of
Consideration Loan Notes held by the Relevant \t\tWarrantor,  \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| and \t\twhere such amount is less than the aggregate
principal amount of \t\tConsideration Loan Notes held by the Relevant
Warrantor, the Buyer shall \t\ton the Redemption Date redeem the remaining
Consideration Loan \t\tNotes in excess of the amount to be retained in
accordance with this \t\tparagraph 5 and shall pay the Redemption Amount in
respect of such \t\tredeemed Consideration Loan Notes to the Relevant
Warrantors in \t\taccordance with the terms of the Consideration Loan Note
Instrument.

 \t\t _Settled Claims_  \t\t 
 \t \t\t6  \t\t| A \t\tClaim shall be deemed "Settled" for the purposes of
this Schedule 9 if: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| the Warrantors\' \t\tRepresentative and the
Buyer so agree in writing; or \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| the Claim has \t\tbeen determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction from which there is \t\tno right of appeal, or from
whose judgment the Buyer or the Warrantors \t\t(as the case may be) are
debarred by passage of time or otherwise from \t\tmaking an appeal, \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| and \t\ta "Settled Amount" shall be the amount agreed or
determined respectively \t\tin accordance with paragraph 6(a) and 6(b).

 _ \t\tRelevant Warrantors\' right to refer Claim to Counsel_  \t\t 
 \t \t\t7  \t\t| If \t\tone or more Notices of Claim have been served but
are not Settled prior \t\tto the Redemption Date, the Relevant Warrantors may
at any time after \t\tthe Redemption Date serve written notice on the Buyer
that they wish to \t\trefer any such Claim to Counsel (a "Reference Notice").

 \t\tFor the purpose of this Schedule 9, all references to \t\t"Counsel"
shall be to a barrister of good standing and of not less than \t\tten year\'s
call jointly instructed by the Sellers\' Solicitors and the \t\tBuyer\'s
Solicitors or if not agreed within five Business Days, following \t\tthe
service on the Buyer of a Reference Notice, to be nominated by
the \t\tPresident for the time being of the Law Society on the written
request \t\tof either the Buyer or the Relevant Warrantors. \t\t 
 \t \t\t8  \t\t| If \t\ta Reference Notice is served on the Buyer by the
Relevant Warrantors in \t\taccordance with paragraph 7: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| Counsel shall \t\tbe instructed to determine
within 20 Business Days of his nomination: \t\t 
   Claim has a \t\treasonable prospect of being determined by a court or
tribunal of \t\tcompetent jurisdiction or arbitration in favour of the Buyer
and \t\tresulting in an amount of damages being payable, after having
full \t\tregard to the provisions of clause 6 (warranties), Schedule
7 \t\t(limitations on liability) and the other provisions of this
Agreement, \t\tby the Warrantors to the Buyer (such a Claim being a "Counsel
Approved \t\tClaim"); and

(ii) in the \t\tevent that a Claim is a Counsel Approved Claim, whether the
Buyer\'s \t\tEstimate is, in his view, too high to constitute a reasonable
estimate \t\tof damages payable if such Claim is successful; and \t\t 
---|---|--- 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| the Buyer shall \t\tprovide Counsel with all
relevant information about such Claim (insofar \t\tas reasonably possible
within the time period) in the possession of the \t\tBuyer or the Group
Companies together with any other information in the \t\tpossession of the
Buyer or the Group Companies which Counsel may reasonably \t\trequest for the
purpose of making his determination. \t\t 
 \t \t\t9  \t\t| If \t\tCounsel determines that the Claim is a Counsel
Approved Claim and that \t\tthe Buyer\'s Estimate is a reasonable estimate of
the value of the Claim, \t\tthen: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| an amount equal \t\tto the Relevant
Warrantors\' Proportion of the Buyer\'s Estimate shall not \t\tbe redeemed by
the Buyer, notwithstanding any obligation to redeem such \t\tConsideration
Loan Notes pursuant to the Consideration Loan Note \t\tInstrument, and shall
be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of \t\tthis Schedule 9, as
appropriate; and \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| the fees and \t\tdisbursements of the
Sellers\' Solicitors and of Counsel (together with \t\tVAT thereon) shall be
paid by the Relevant Warrantors and the Buyer in \t\tsuch proportions as
Counsel shall determine as being fair and reasonable \t\tin the circumstances
having regard to Counsel\'s opinion of the merits of \t\tthe case for each of
the Buyer and the Relevant Warrantors. \t\t 
 \t \t\t10  \t\t| If \t\tCounsel determines that the Claim is a Counsel
Approved Claim, but that \t\tthe Buyer\'s Estimate is too high, then: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| Counsel shall \t\tbe instructed by the
Sellers\' Solicitors to estimate the amount that the \t\tBuyer would be
expected to recover should the Counsel Approved Claim be \t\tdetermined in
favour of the Buyer by a court or tribunal of competent \t\tjurisdiction or
arbitration, with Counsel\'s estimate reflecting both the \t\tlikely
prospects of success of the Claim and its quantum
("Counsel\'s \t\tEstimate");  \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| an aggregate \t\tprincipal amount of
Consideration Loan Notes held by the Relevant \t\tWarrantor equal to the
Relevant Warrantors\' Proportion of Counsel\'s \t\tEstimate shall not be
redeemed by the Buyer, notwithstanding any \t\tobligation to redeem such
Consideration Loan Notes pursuant to the \t\tConsideration Loan Note
Instrument, and shall be dealt with in \t\taccordance with the provisions of
this Schedule 9, as appropriate, and \t\tany further amounts outstanding to
the Relevant Warrantors pursuant to \t\tthe Consideration Loan Note
Instrument shall be paid within two Business \t\tDays of Counsel\'s
determination by the Buyer to the Relevant Warrantors; \t\tand \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (c)  \t\t| the fees and \t\tdisbursements of the
Sellers\' Solicitors and of Counsel (together with \t\tVAT thereon) shall be
paid by the Relevant Warrantors and the Buyer in \t\tsuch proportions as
Counsel shall determine as being fair and reasonable \t\tin the circumstances
having regard to Counsel\'s opinion of the merits of \t\tthe case for each of
the Buyer and the Relevant Warrantors.  \t\t 
 \t \t\t11  \t\t| If \t\tCounsel determines that the Claim is not a
Counsel Approved Claim, then: \t\t 
 \t  Consideration Loan Notes held by the Relevant \t\tWarrantors and pay all
amounts in respect of which the Relevant \t\tWarrantors have served a notice
of redemption on the Company pursuant to \t\tcondition 3.3 of the
Consideration Loan Note Instrument, without regard \t\tto any right of set-
off in respect of such Claim whatsoever; and \t\t 
---|---|--- 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| the Sellers\' \t\tSolicitors fees and
disbursements and Counsel\'s fees and disbursements \t\t(together with VAT
thereon) shall be borne entirely by the Buyer. \t\t 
 \t \t\t12  \t\t|  \t\tCounsel shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator and: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| his decision as \t\tto:

(i) whether any Claim is a Counsel Approved \t\tClaim; and

 \t\t

(ii) whether the Buyer\'s Estimate was reasonable; and \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| Counsel\'s \t\tEstimate of the quantum of such
a Claim, \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t|  \t\tshall in each case (in the absence of manifest error)
be final and \t\tbinding on the Relevant Warrantors and the Buyer.  \t\t 
 \t \t\t13  \t\t| To \t\tthe extent that any proportion of the
Consideration Loan Notes are not \t\tredeemed by the Buyer pursuant to
paragraphs 5, 9 or 10(b), such \t\tConsideration Loan Notes shall (subject to
paragraph 14) be used to \t\tsatisfy Settled Claims only by way of
cancellation of the Consideration \t\tLoan Notes in accordance with
paragraphs 1 and 2, and within three \t\tBusiness Days of any Claims being
Settled all amounts remaining \t\toutstanding in respect of the Consideration
Loan Notes (to include any \t\tbalance of the Redemption Amount together with
all accrued interest from \t\tthe Redemption Date) (save for any amounts
which the Buyer is entitled \t\tnot to redeem as a consequence of any Further
Claims not yet Settled in \t\taccordance with this Schedule) shall be paid by
the Buyer to the \t\tRelevant Warrantors in accordance with the terms set out
in the \t\tConsideration Loan Notes. \t\t 
 \t \t\t14  \t\t| To \t\tthe extent that any proportion of the
Consideration Loan Notes have not \t\tbeen released by the Buyer pursuant to
paragraphs 5, 9, or 10(b) by 1 \t\tApril 2016 (the "End Date", any Relevant
Warrantor may elect (by \t\twritten notice served on the Buyer not less than
21 days prior to the \t\tEnd Date confirming such election) that the
Redemption Amount still \t\toutstanding (including any interest accrued
thereon) on such \t\tConsideration Loan Notes be redeemed on the End Date. If
such an \t\telection is served, then payment of such Redemption Amount shall
be \t\tsatisfied by the payment of that amount into an Escrow Account, and
the \t\tmonies held in such Escrow Account shall be dealt with in such a
manner \t\tas ensures that: \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (a)  \t\t| upon any Claims \t\tbeing Settled, an amount
equal to that amount which would have been \t\tcancelled in respect of such
Consideration Loan Notes pursuant to this \t\tSchedule 9 had such redemption
not taken place on the End Date shall be \t\tpaid from the Escrow Account to
the Buyer; and \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| (b)  \t\t| any amount \t\tstill remaining to the credit
of the Escrow Account upon all Claims in \t\trespect of a Relevant Warrantor
being Settled shall be paid to the \t\tRelevant Warrantor, \t\t 
 \t \t\t  \t\t| in \t\teach case within 5 Business Days of the relevant
Claims relating to such \t\tRelevant Warrantors being settled. In the event
that a written notice is \t\tserved by a Relevant Warrantor pursuant to this
paragraph, the parties \t\tshall take such actions and execute all such
documents (including \t\twithout limitation an escrow agreement or other
terms of engagement of a \t\trelevant Escrow Agent) as are reasonably
necessary to procure that an \t\tEscrow Account is established with an Escrow
Agreement for the purposes \t\tof this paragraph 14. \t\t 
   held by a Permitted Transferee \t\tof a Manager shall be treated as Loan
Notes held by that Manager and \t\tshall be subject to the provisions of this
