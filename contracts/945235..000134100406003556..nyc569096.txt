Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any
of the following securities:   (a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Each share of
Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
3.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares) ("Shares") shall be converted into the
right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable
withholding Tax specified in Section 3.5(c)) equal to $52.75 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, each holder of
a certificate theretofore representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificates
in accordance with Section 3.5, without interest.   (c) Each Share held in
the treasury of the Company, or otherwise owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or
owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of such Persons, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.   Section 3.2 Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards.   (a)
As of the Effective Time, each Option will be canceled and extinguished, and
the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
excess (if any) of (i) the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to
such Option and (B) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the aggregate exercise
price of such Option, without interest and less any required withholding
Taxes as specified in Section 3.5(c). All payments with respect to canceled
Options shall be made by the Paying Agent as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance
with Section 3.5(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any
and all actions necessary to effectuate the cancelation of Options pursuant
to this Section 3.2(a), including adopting any plan amendments.   (b) As of
the Effective Time, each Stock Appreciation Right will be canceled and
extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in
cash equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the lesser of (A) the "target price"
applicable thereto (if any) and (B) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the
"grant price" applicable thereto, without interest and less any required
withholding Taxes as specified in Section 3.5(c). All payments with respect
to canceled Stock Appreciation Rights shall be made by the Paying Agent as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from
funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay
such amounts in accordance with Section 3.5(a). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate the
cancelation of Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section 3.2(b).  
(c) As of the Effective Time, each Restricted Share that is issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of Restricted Shares,
become fully vested. Each vested Restricted Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with
respect thereto equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest and less
any required withholding Taxes as specified in Section 3.5(c). At the
Effective Time, each holder of a Restricted Share (other than any Dissenting
Shares, which shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.4) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger
Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and
all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 3.2(c), including providing
holders of Restricted Shares with notice of their rights with respect to any
such Restricted Shares as provided herein.   (d) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take such action as is necessary to cause the ending
date of the then current offering period under the Company\'s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to be at least thirty (30) days prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of such plan (the "Final Purchase
Date"). On the Final Purchase Date, the Company shall apply the funds
credited as of such date under such ESPP within each participant\'s payroll
withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares of the Company in
accordance with the terms of such ESPP and shall prevent the commencement of
any new purchase or offering period.   (e) As of the Effective Time, each
Stock Equivalent that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to represent a right to receive upon distribution a share of
Company Common Stock and shall instead be converted automatically into a
right to receive an amount in cash determined in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Director Compensation Plan (including applicable interest
accruing after the Effective Time). Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the terms of
the Director Compensation Plans, subject to the adjustments pursuant to this
Section 3.2(e).   Section 3.3 Adjustment of Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and any other dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other
dependent item, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence.   Section 3.4 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, Article 13 of the GBCC (the
"Dissenters Provisions"), shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters Provisions;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters
Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration.   (b) The Company will give Parent prompt notice of
any notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any
Shares, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant
to the Dissenters Provisions and received by the Company and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to the exercise of dissenters\' rights under the Dissenters
Provisions. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such
exercise of dissenters\' rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights.   Section 3.5 Payment and Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the shareholders
of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as Paying Agent in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will, or cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit in trust with, the
Paying Agent, the aggregate consideration to which shareholders, holders of
Options, holders of Stock Appreciation Rights, and holders of Restricted
Shares of the Company become entitled under this Article III. Until used for
that purpose, the funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of
America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody\'s Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker\'s acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and
undivided profits aggregating more than $500,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of the banks which are then publicly available at
the SEC or otherwise).   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who
was a record holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whose shares were converted pursuant to Article III into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a form of letter of
transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Common Stock
(each, a "Certificate") in order to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), and shall otherwise be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.
When the Paying Agent receives a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents, the Paying Agent shall pay to
the holder of the Shares represented by the Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), or as otherwise directed in the letter
of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to each
Share represented by such Certificate, less any required Tax withholdings
in accordance with Section 3.5(c), and the Certificate shall be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered must be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person
who surrenders the Certificate must provide funds for payment of any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that all Taxes have been paid
or are not applicable. After the Effective Time, a Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.  
(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Paying Agent, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration and any other
amount otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Options, Stock Appreciation
Rights, or Restricted Shares pursuant to the Merger or this Agreement (each,
a "Payee ") such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Payee in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.   (d) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to accept an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed instead of the Certificate; provided, that the Surviving
Corporation may require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid,
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving
Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.   (e) At any time which is more than six (6) months after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been deposited with the
Paying Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article III
(including interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect
of the funds made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with
this Article III shall be entitled to look solely to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates
held by them, without any interest thereon. Any portion of the funds
deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent
will be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article III for
any consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (f) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not record on the stock
transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation any transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented for
transfer, they shall be canceled and treated as having been surrendered for
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented thereby.

As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC (subject to the prior review and approval
of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) the Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each case,
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall include in such document or response comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.   (b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate
an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto describing such
information to the Company\'s shareholders.   (c) The Company and Parent
shall use their reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
party, to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, during the period from the

Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Effective Time, the Company (i)
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, subject to reasonable
restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel respecting the
provision of privileged communications or any applicable confidentiality
agreement with any Person (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain waivers under such agreements or implement requisite
procedures to enable the provision of reasonable access without violating
such agreement), afford representatives of Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to officers, employees,
agents, and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to all
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and will furnish, within a
reasonable time, to Parent all financial, operating and other data
and information (including extracts and copies of books, records, Contracts
and other documents concerning the operations and business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), including access to its personnel as Parent may
reasonably request, and (ii) shall furnish monthly financial statements
(including unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for each month then ended and related consolidated
statements of earnings for the Company and its operating segments and cash
flows as well as a forecast for the remainder of the then-current fiscal
year) that the Company furnishes the Board in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice to Parent promptly after providing such financial
statements to the Board.   (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent if
(i) any Key Customer or Key Supplier has cancelled, otherwise terminated or
adversely modified its relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice from any Key Customer or Key Supplier to the effect that any such Key
Customer intends to (A) terminate or adversely modify in any material respect
its relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) request
proposals with respect to any business currently provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
involved in any material dispute with a Key Customer or Key Supplier. For
purposes of this Section 6.4(b), (1) "Key Customer" shall be as defined in
Section 4.22 but shall also include any customer that would have been a Key
Customer had it been a customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof and (2) "Key Supplier" shall be as defined in Section 4.22
but shall also include any supplier that would have been a Key Supplier had
it been a supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof.   (c) All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall
continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, affirm and assume all
obligations of confidentiality of Clarke American Corp. thereunder.   (d) No
investigation or notice delivered pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise
shall operate as a waiver or affect any representation, warranty or agreement
in this Agreement of any party or any condition to the obligations of the
parties.   Section 6.5 Solicitation.   (a) From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and its and their Representatives not to, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal, or participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter
into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other Contract providing for
or relating to a Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) enter into any
Contract requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) propose or agree to
do any of the foregoing (provided that this clause (v) will not affect the
Company\'s right to negotiate with a Person in respect of a Company Takeover
Proposal or Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 6.5(b) or Section
6.5(c)). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities that would otherwise be a violation of this Section
6.5(a) conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and
will cause any such parties (and their agents or advisors) in possession of
confidential information regarding the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to return or destroy such information.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.5(a), if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Requisite
Shareholder Vote, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Company Takeover Proposal from any third party and (ii) the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside counsel, that (A) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (B) the
failure to provide non-public information concerning the Company or enter
into discussions or negotiations with such third party would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal
(subject to the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Company Takeover Proposal regarding such Company Takeover Proposal; provided
the Company will promptly (within two (2) Business Days) provide to Parent
any non-public information that is provided to a third party concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries not previously provided to Parent. The Company
shall promptly (within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent in the event it
receives a Company Takeover Proposal, including the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal, and shall keep Parent reasonably apprised as to the status
and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the
same. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will promptly (within one
(1) Business Day) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to
begin providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Company
Takeover Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote,
if the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside counsel) that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board may effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal; provided, however, the Board may not effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal unless:   (A) the Company shall have provided prior written 
notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the  "Notice
Period"), of its intention to effect such a Recommendation  Withdrawal which
notice shall specify the reasons therefor, including,  if the basis of the
Recommendation Withdrawal is a Superior Proposal,  the terms and conditions
of any such Superior Proposal (including the  identity of the party making
such Superior Proposal), and shall have  contemporaneously provided a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction  Contracts with the party making such
Superior Proposal; and   (B) prior to effecting such Recommendation 
Withdrawal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors  and
outside counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent  in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such  adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that there  is no longer a
basis for such Recommendation Withdrawal.  In the event of any material
revisions to any applicable Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 6.5(c) with respect to such new written notice.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be
entitled to enter into any Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to a Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has been
or is concurrently terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 8.1 and the
Company has concurrently paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.3.   (d) Any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 6.5 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5 by the
Company.   (e) The Company shall not take any action to (i) amend
the Rights Agreement or redeem the Rights (as defined in the Rights
Agreement), or (ii) exempt any Person from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Article 11 of the GBCC (or any similar provisions)
or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.   (f) Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing
to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to
the Company\'s shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board,
after consultation with and receipt of advice from its outside counsel,
failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided however,
that in no event shall the Company or the Board or any committee thereof
take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 6.2.  
(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
assigned below:   "Company Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal
or  offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or its 
Affiliates relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase  of a
business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net  income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  or 15% or more
of any class or series of securities of the Company or  any of its
Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if  consummated would
result in any Person or group of Persons beneficially  owning 15% or more of
any class or series of capital stock of the  Company, or any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,  business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or  similar transaction involving
the Company (or any Subsidiary or  Subsidiaries of the Company whose business
constitutes 15% or more of  the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and   "Superior Proposal"
means a bona fide Company Takeover  Proposal (except that references to 15%
will be deemed to be references  to "more than 66?%") made in writing and not
solicited by the Company  in violation of Section 6.5 that is on terms that
the Board determines  in good faith (after consultation with its independent
financial  advisor), taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial  (including the effect of any Company Termination Fee payable) and
other  aspects of the Company Takeover Proposal and the third party making
the  Company Takeover Proposal (including the financial capability of such 
third party to consummate the Company Takeover Proposal), is more  favorable
to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, as amended from time to time.   Section 6.6 Further Action;
Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be

practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees
to make any required submissions under the HSR Act that the Company or Parent
determines should be made, in each case, with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to make other
required filings pursuant to other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws and use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or
advisable consistent with this Section 6.6 to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining
whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained
under any other federal, state or foreign Law or whether any consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other
parties to Contracts material to the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
business in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and applicable Law, Parent
and the Company shall (1) promptly notify the other party of any
communication to that party from any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger, (2)
if practicable, permit the other party the opportunity to review in
advance all the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and incorporate the other
party\'s reasonable comments; (3) not participate in any substantive meeting
or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend;
and (4) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondences, filings,
and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, provided, however, that any materials may be redacted before being
provided to the other party (i) to remove references concerning the valuation
of Parent, the Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, (ii)
financing arrangements, (iii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iv) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other party if such party becomes aware that any third party has any
objection to the Merger on antitrust or anti-competitive grounds.   (b) The
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections
that may be asserted by any Person with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Law
in order to enable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as promptly as practicable. In connection therewith, if any
Action is pending or threatened challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as inconsistent with or violative of any Antitrust Law
or other applicable Law, the parties shall cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and to have
vacated, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order under any Antitrust
Law that is in effect and that prohibits, delays or restricts the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval
or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect
to the Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration,
make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such
Person and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to incur any liability or
other obligation.   (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to (i)
limit in any manner whatsoever or not exercise any rights of ownership of any
securities (including the Shares), or divest, dispose of or hold separate any
securities or all or a portion of their respective businesses, assets or
properties or of the business, assets or properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or agree to do any of the foregoing), (ii) limit in any
manner whatsoever the ability of such entities (A) to conduct their
respective businesses or own their respective businesses, assets or
properties or to conduct the businesses or own the businesses, properties or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) to control their respective
businesses or operations or the businesses or operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or agree to do any of the foregoing) or (iii) take or agree
to take any other action or agree to any other limitation or restriction,

expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, financial
condition or results of operations of either (1) Parent and its Affiliates,
taken as a whole, or (2) any of the Company\'s Printed Products, Software and
Services or Scantron business segments; provided, however, that the Company
shall be obligated to take or agree to take any such action or agree to any
such limitation or restriction to the extent requested in writing by
Parent, provided that the effectiveness of any such action or agreement is
contingent upon the Closing.   Section 6.7 Directors\' and Officers\'

During the period commencing upon the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all of the parties and terminating upon the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make the
timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 impossible or unlikely, which notice shall indicate that it is
being delivered in accordance with this Section 6.10. No such notification
shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter for the
purpose of (a) determining the accuracy of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in this Agreement, or (b) determining whether
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3
has been satisfied. Delivery of notification pursuant to this Section 6.10
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any
party receiving such notice.   Section 6.11 Employment and Benefits
Matters.   (a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending
on the 12-month anniversary of the Effective Time (such period, the
"Continuation Period"), the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
remain in the employment of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") shall
receive compensation and employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided under the
Company\'s employee benefit plans to such employees in accordance with their
terms in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall have any obligation to issue or adopt any plans or arrangements
providing for the issuance of shares of capital stock, warrants, options,
stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital
stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such
shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; provided further that no
plans or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for
such issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee
benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate. Following the
Continuation Period, the Company Employees shall be entitled to participate
in the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including equity-based and equity-related plans) to the same extent as other
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   (b) To the
extent that any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries is made
available to any Company Employee, on or following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be granted to such Company Employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary) (such service, "Pre-Closing Service") for all
purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (other than for benefit
accrual purposes under any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA)); provided, however, that Pre-Closing Service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Benefit Plans and Foreign Plans) (such plans, collectively,
the "New Plans ") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan in which such
Company Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
means to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.   (c) Without limiting the generality of Sections 6.11(a)
and 6.11(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain the severance plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
their material terms as in effect at the Effective Time for a period of one
year following the Effective Time and to provide each Company Employee who is
employed primarily in the United States or Puerto Rico and whose employment
is terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries on
or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time without cause (as
determined by Parent or its Subsidiaries) with severance and other separation
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than what would be
payable to such Company Employee pursuant to the severance plan or policy
that was applicable to such Company Employee as of the Effective Time. For
purposes of determining the severance and other separation benefits to which
a Company Employee shall become entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence,
such Company Employee\'s service with Parent and its Subsidiaries and all
Pre-Closing Service shall be recognized.   (d) Without limiting the
generality of Section 6.11(a), with respect to the annual performance period
in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) honor and continue in all material respects the
cash incentive compensation plans maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the "Incentive Plans") pursuant to their
respective terms (except as modified by the following clauses (ii) and (iii))
as in effect at the Effective Time with respect to the annual performance
period thereunder commencing prior to and ending after the Effective Time,
(ii) at the time(s) prescribed by the Incentive Plans as in effect at the
Effective Time, make payments to the Company Employees in accordance with the
applicable material terms of the Incentive Plans as in effect at the
Effective Time (without regard to any plan provision requiring an employee to
remain continuously employed until the date that payments under
the applicable Incentive Plan are made) and (iii) provide any Company
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their Subsidiaries without cause (as determined by Parent or its
Subsidiaries) prior to the time at which such payments are made with an
amount in cash equal to such Company Employee\'s target annual bonus in
effect under the applicable Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time, prorated
to reflect the portion of such annual performance period that elapsed prior
to such termination.   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to
terminate, any Company Employee for any reason or (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11,
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to
continue any Benefit Plan or New Plan or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Closing Date.   (f) Parent hereby agrees
to take the actions set forth in Section 6.11(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the extent applicable.   Section 6.12 Section 16(b). The Company
shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   Section 6.13 Takeover Statutes.
The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take
all action necessary so that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(b) if any such Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.14 Retention
Bonuses. In the event that (a) the Closing occurs, on the date that is 30
days following the Closing or (b) the Agreement is terminated, on the date
that is 30 days following such termination (in either case, the "Payment
Date") (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next Business Day
following such date), the Surviving Corporation or the Company,
as applicable, shall pay to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who is listed in Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter the amount of
cash set forth therein with respect to such employee (as to each such
employee, the "Retention Bonus"), provided, that such employee remains
continuously employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
if the Closing occurs, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries)
from the date hereof through and including the applicable Payment Date;
provided, further, that in the event that any such employee\'s employment is
terminated involuntarily without cause (as determined by the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable) prior to the applicable Payment Date,
such employee shall be treated for purposes of this Section 6.14 as having
been employed on such Payment Date and shall be entitled to receive the
Retention Bonus within 30 days following termination. In the event the
Agreement is terminated and Retention Bonuses are paid by the Company, Parent
shall only be obligated to reimburse the Company in the event it is required
to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section
8.3(d).   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO MERGER   Section 7.1

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject

Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
further subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the

qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or a
Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification), shall be
true, complete and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (unless any such
representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event
such representation or warranty shall be true, complete and correct as of
such specific date), except where the failure of any such representation or
warranty to be so true, complete and correct would not have a Material
Adverse Effect;   (b) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have performed
in all material respects each of the obligations, and complied in all
material respects with each of the agreements and covenants, required to be
performed by or complied with by them under this Agreement at or prior to the

this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such
date (unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of a
specific date, in which event such representation or warranty shall be true,
complete and correct as of such specific date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true, complete and correct would
not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  
(b) each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material
respects the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the
agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date; and   (c) the

Vote) prior to the Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being
an effective termination by Merger Sub):   (a) by mutual written consent of
the Company and Parent;   (b) by either the Company or Parent if any

contest, appeal and remove such injunction, order or other legal

terminated on or before the Outside Date, the Outside Date may be extended by
Parent (by written notice to the Company) to the day following the last day
of the Completion Period (and, if so extended, the "Outside Date" shall be
deemed to refer to such later date); provided, further, however, the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be primarily due to the failure of such party to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;   (d)
by either the Company or Parent, if the Requisite Shareholder Vote shall not
have been obtained at the Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on such adoption was taken;   (e) by
the Company if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.3(a) or (b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date;   (f) by Parent:   (i) if a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or (b) not to be satisfied, and such
breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date; or   (ii) if the
Board, any committee thereof or the Company shall have (A) effected a
Recommendation Withdrawal, (B) taken any of the actions described in clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 6.5(a) (whether or not permitted to do
so), or (C) failed to call the Shareholders Meeting in accordance with this
Agreement.   Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
any party or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except Sections
4.25, 5.7, 6.4(c), 6.14, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will
survive such termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve the Company from liabilities for damages or other costs or expenses
incurred or suffered by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of any willful
breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements set forth in this Agreement.   Section 8.3 Fees and
Expenses.   (a) Except as provided in this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.   (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent
the Company Termination Fee as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within one (1) Business Day) following such termination.   (c) In the event
that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) (but only if the Shareholders Meeting has not been held) or
Section 8.1(d) (or, after the Shareholders Meeting has been held and there
has been a failure by the Company to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Vote,
and this Agreement becomes terminable for such reason, the Company terminates
this Agreement for any other reason), (ii) at any time prior to such
termination a Company Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or
publicly made known and not irrevocably withdrawn, and (iii) within 12 months
after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive Contract with respect to, or consummates, any Company
Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent on the date of, and
as a condition to, such execution or consummation, the Company Termination
Fee. For purposes of this Section 8.3(c), the term "Company Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.5(g),
except that all references to 15% therein shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%".   (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c) and at the
time of any such termination all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
have been satisfied or waived except for (1) any of the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.1(b), 7.1(c) (in the case of Section 7.1(c), only to the extent
that the condition set forth therein has not been satisfied due to a
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order issued by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or other
legal restraint relating to U.S. Antitrust Laws which prohibits, restrains or
renders illegal the consummation of the Merger being in effect) and 7.2(d)
(in the case of Section 7.2(d), only to the extent that the condition set
forth therein has not been satisfied due to an administrative or judicial
Action brought by or on behalf of a Governmental Authority being pending or
threatened challenging the Merger as inconsistent with or violative of any
U.S. Antitrust Law) and (2) such other conditions that are capable of being
satisfied on the date of termination but, by their terms, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date, then Parent shall pay to the Company as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after such
termination, the Parent Termination Fee and up to an aggregate of $12,000,000
with respect to the retention bonuses described in Section 6.14, to the
extent the Company is obligated to pay such bonuses to certain employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 6.14.   (e) In
the event this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the
Parent Termination Fee has been paid pursuant to Section 8.3(d) and, within
12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive Contract with respect to, or consummates, any
Company Takeover Proposal that has consideration with a value that is equal
to or higher than $52.75 per share of Company Common Stock (as appropriately
adjusted to give effect to any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-
up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction), the
Company shall reimburse the Parent Termination Fee to Parent on the date of,
and as a condition to, such execution or consummation. For purposes of this
Section 8.3(e), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 6.5(g), except that all references to 15%
therein shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%".   (f) Any
amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), 8.3(c) or 8.3(d)
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party entitled to receive such payment. The parties agree
and understand that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, respectively,
on more than one occasion. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not constitute a penalty. If
the Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent any amounts due to
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 8.3 or Parent fails to pay the
Company any amounts due to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3 within
the time periods specified in this Section 8.3, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by Parent or the Company, as applicable, in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect
payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the
prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date of actual payment.   Section 8.4
Procedure for Termination. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective, require action by the board of
directors of the terminating party. Termination of this Agreement prior to
the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of
the Company.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 9.1 Non-
Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights
arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and

Esq.   Section 9.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law
or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.   Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. This
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.   Section 9.5 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any
party by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of
each of the other parties (which consent may be granted or withheld in the
sole discretion of such other party), except that the Agreement may be
assigned by Parent or Merger Sub to an Affiliate of such party; provided that
the party making such assignment shall not be released from its obligations
hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 9.5 shall be
void.   Section 9.6 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Closing Date, whether
before or after approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that, after adoption
of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be
made which under applicable Law requires the further approval of the
shareholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
parties.   Section 9.7 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained for the benefit
of such party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.   Section 9.8 No
Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Section 6.7 (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein, and may be enforced by
any such Persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.   Section 9.9 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER
APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF EXCEPT AND ONLY TO THE
EXTENT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA MANDATORILY APPLY.   Section 9.10
Jurisdiction. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that
the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any state or federal court located in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court
other than a state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware.  
Section 9.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter
into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 9.11.   Section 9.12 Consents and Approvals.
For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any
party to be valid and binding on the parties, such consent or approval must
be in writing.   Section 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original

For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures shall be deemed
originals.   Section 9.14 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
