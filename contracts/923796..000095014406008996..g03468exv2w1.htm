 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 19, 2006, is made by and among THE GEO GROUP, INC., a Florida corporation (" _Parent_ "), GEO ACQUISITION II, INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _MergerCo_ "), and CENTRACORE PROPERTIES TRUST, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger of the Company with and into MergerCo (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (the " _MGCL_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of MergerCo have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable, and Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger as the sole stockholder of MergerCo; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that for federal, and applicable state, income tax purposes the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of the companys assets to MergerCo in exchange for the Merger Consideration (as defined herein) to be provided to the stockholders of the Company and the assumption of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by a distribution of such Merger Consideration to the stockholders of the Company in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for federal income tax purposes; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, MergerCo and the Company hereby agree as follows:

   ##### 

  

 

surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. From and after the
Effective Time, MergerCo shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of the Company. The Merger shall have the effects specified in
Section 259 of the DGCL and Section 8-501.1 of the MGCL. 

   

 1.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

   

 (a) The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "GEO Acquisition II, Inc.". 

   

 (b) The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of MergerCo, as attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _Amended Charter_ "), shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by law. 

   

 (c) The bylaws of MergerCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, by such certificate of incorporation or by such bylaws. 

  

 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, MergerCo and the Company shall duly execute and file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _DSOS_ ") in accordance with the DGCL and articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation for the State of Maryland (the " _MSDAT_ ") in accordance with the MGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the later of the filing date of the Certificate of Merger with the DSOS or the filing date of the Articles of Merger with the MSDAT, or such later time which the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in such filings in accordance with the DGCL and MGCL as the effective time of the Merger but not to exceed ninety (90) days after the respective filing dates of the Certificate of Merger with the DSOS and the Articles of Merger with the MSDAT (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same (unless extended by the mutual agreement of the parties hereto), and, subject to the foregoing, shall take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on such date (the " _Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, or at such other place as mutually agreed to by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not occur before January 1, 2007 without the mutual consent of both parties. 

  

 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Amended Charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 
  _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Stock_  

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of MergerCo_. Each share of common stock of MergerCo, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall represent one (1) share of the validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and MergerCo-Owned Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that is owned by Parent, MergerCo or any Subsidiary of Parent or MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in amount equal to (i) $32.00, plus (ii) an amount equal to $0.46 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days between the last day of the last quarter for which full quarterly dividends on the Company Common Stock have been declared and paid and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date), by (y) the total number of days in the quarter in which the Closing Date occurs ((i) and (ii) together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (d) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law. 

   

 (e) _Cancellation of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or nonqualified option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (" _Company Equity Award Plans_ "), whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the exercise price thereof, shall be 

   ##### 

  

   

cancelled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for the right to
receive at the Effective Time a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
vested or exercisable, and (y) the excess, if any, of $32.00 over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option
Merger Consideration_ "); provided that if the exercise price per share of
any such Company Option is equal to or greater than $32.00, such Company
Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. 

   

 (f) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all restricted stock awards granted under the Company Equity Award Plans shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (g) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all deferred share awards granted pursuant to the Companys Deferred Share Long-Term Loyalty Bonus Agreement as set forth in Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements and all deferred shares of Company Common Stock granted in connection therewith shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration. At least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, and for the benefit of holders of Company Stock Options for payment in accordance with Section 2.1(e), the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Merger Consideration (such total deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent. 

   

 (b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the common stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the applicable Merger 

   ##### 

  

   

Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby. On and after the Effective Time, a holder of a Company
Stock Option shall have only the right to receive the Option Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(e). 

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Effective Time (but in any event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options Exchanged For Cash_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company Stock Options in accordance with the terms of this Article II and Section 2.1(e) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the canceled Company Stock Options and on and after the Effective Time the holder of a Company Stock Option shall have no further rights to exercise any Company Stock Option. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration or the Option Merger Consideration, as applicable. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration, as applicable, from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person (including, without limitation, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not restricted, Company Stock Options or any grantee of a Company deferred share award) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 2.4 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger. 

  

 2.5 _Alternative Structure of the Merger_. While it is currently contemplated that the Merger shall be effected through the merger of the Company with and into MergerCo, Parent 

   ##### 

  

 

may elect by timely prior written notice to the Company, to cause the Merger
to be effected through an alternative transaction structure pursuant to which
MergerCo would merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving
(the " _Alternative Merger_ "), in which case, at the effective time of
the Alternative Merger, (a) the Company would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, (b) all the property, rights privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and MergerCo shall vest in the Company as the
surviving corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and MergerCo shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company as
the surviving corporation, and (c) the conversion and cancellation of shares
of the capital stock of the Company and Merger Co shall be effected as set
forth on Exhibit B. The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to consent to or deny such alternative structure. If Parent makes
such election and the Company consents, (i) the parties shall take all
actions and make all filings required to consummate the Alternative Merger,
including MergerCo and the Company shall duly execute and file a certificate
of merger (" _Alternative Certificate of Merger_ ") with the DSOS
in accordance with the DGCL and articles of merger (" _Alternative Articles
of Merger_ ") with the MSDAT in accordance with the MGCL, (ii) the
Alternative Merger shall become effective upon the later of the filing date
of the Alternative Certificate of Merger with the DSOS or the filing date of
the Alternative Articles of Merger with the MSDAT, or such later time which
the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in such filings in
accordance with the DGCL and the MGCL as the effective time of the
Alternative Merger but not to exceed ninety (90) days after the
respective filing dates of the Alternative Certificate of Merger with the
DSOS and the Alternative Articles of Merger with the MSDAT (the "
_Alternative Merger Effective Time_ "), (iii) "the Merger" shall be
deemed to refer to the Alternative Merger, (iv) "Effective Time" shall be
deemed to refer to the Alternative Merger Effective Time and (v) "Surviving
Corporation" shall be deemed to refer to the Company in its capacity as the
surviving entity in the Alternative Merger. 

   

 2.6 _Alternative Structure of the Acquisition_. While it is currently contemplated that the Merger shall be effected through the merger of the Company with and into MergerCo, Parent may elect, by timely prior written notice to the Company, to cause the Merger to be effected through an alternative transaction structure pursuant to which the Company sells to Parent or MergerCo all of the partnership interests of CPT Operating Partnership L.P. in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration. The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to consent to or deny such alternative structure.

   ##### 

  

   

Company stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, or

The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f) in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b) or any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) where a fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.2(c), the rights to payment under Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), as applicable: (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(c), as applicable and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing. Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), Parent and MergerCo hereby agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where a fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), in no event shall Parent or MergerCo (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any of their respective trustees, directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or shareholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive damages. 

  

 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees, costs and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses. 

  

 8.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_. The maximum amount that the Company can receive in its taxable year in which occurs the event giving rise to liability for the Break-up Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or any fee pursuant to Section 8.2(c) (collectively, the " _Section 8.2 Amount_") shall be the maximum amount that the Company can receive in that taxable year without failing the REIT Income Requirements (as defined below), determined as if the receipt of that amount does not constitute Qualifying Income (as defined below), as determined by the independent accountants of the Company (each such annual amount, the " _Annual Payment Amount_ "). If the Annual Payment Amount (as determined by the independent accountants of the Company) for the taxable year in which the Section 8.2 Amount first becomes owed is less than the Section 8.2 Amount, Parent shall pay only the Annual Payment Amount in that taxable year, 

   ##### 

  

 

and any excess portion of the Section 8.2 Amount shall be payable in
subsequent taxable years only to the extent provided below. The Company shall
send a letter to Parent during each subsequent taxable year indicating
the portion of the unpaid Section 8.2 Amount that Parent shall pay to the
Company in that taxable year, which amount shall be the Annual Payment Amount
for that taxable year set forth in a letter from the Companys independent
accountants. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number of
payments that can be made from Parent to the Company prior to the sixth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to receive from Parent in any taxable year any portion of
the Section 8.2 Amount in excess of the Annual Payment Amount (as determined
by the independent accountants of the Company) for that taxable year. The
obligation of Parent to pay any unpaid portion of the Section 8.2 Amount
shall terminate six years from the date of this Agreement. Income is "
_Qualifying Income_ " if it is described in any subparagraph of Section
856(c)(2) of the Code and in any subparagraph of Section 856(c)(3) of the
Code. The " _REIT Income Requirements_ " are the requirements imposed by
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) on the income that an entity can receive and
qualify as a REIT for purposes of the Code. The remainder of this  _Section
8.4_ notwithstanding, Parent shall pay the Company any unpaid portion of the
Section 8.2 Amount at any time prior to six years from the date of this
Agreement if the Company delivers to Parent a copy of a letter from outside
counsel which states that the Company has received a private letter ruling
from the IRS which holds that its receipt of a payment of the Section
8.2 Amount constitutes Qualifying Income or is excludible from gross income
for purposes of the REIT Income Requirements. 

   

 8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time before or after any approval hereof by holders of the Company Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining such approval. 

  

 8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 9.5 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. Except for Articles I and II, Sections 6.5 and 6.8 and any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time (a) none of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time and (b) thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, MergerCo or the Company or any of their respective officers, directors, trustees, stockholders or shareholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any party hereto, express or implied.

executed in two or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single
agreement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in

is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically

 9.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. 

  

 9.9 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

   

 (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. 

   

 (b) Each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland or any court of the United States located in the State of Maryland for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in such court and agrees not to plead or claim in such court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland. For purposes of implementing the parties agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of Maryland, each of Parent and MergerCo does hereby appoint CorpDirect Agents, Inc., 516 North Charles Street, 5th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201, as such agent, and the Company does hereby appoint Corporation Service Company, 11 E.

The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. 

  

 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.
