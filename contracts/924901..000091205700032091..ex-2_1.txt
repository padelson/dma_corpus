viii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of June 27, 2000, by and among MACK-CALI
REALTY CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation ("Mack-Cali"), MACK-CALI REALTY,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Mack-Cali Partnership"), PRENTISS
PROPERTIES TRUST, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Prentiss"), and
PRENTISS PROPERTIES ACQUISITION PARTNERS, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership ("Prentiss Partnership").   R E C I T A L S:   A. The Board of
Directors of Mack-Cali and the Board of Trustees of Prentiss have determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies
and shareholders, that upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained
herein, Prentiss shall merge with and into Mack-Cali, with Mack-Cali being
the surviving corporation (the "Merger").   B. Mack-Cali, as the sole
general partner of Mack-Cali Partnership, and Prentiss, as the sole general
partner (through a wholly-owned direct subsidiary) of Prentiss Partnership,
have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective partnerships and limited partners that upon the terms and subject
to the conditions contained herein, immediately prior to the Merger, Prentiss
Partnership shall merge with and into Mack-Cali Partnership (or a limited
liability company or limited partnership owned entirely directly and/or
indirectly, by Mack-Cali Partnership, as determined by Mack-Cali and Mack-
Cali Partnership), with Mack-Cali Partnership being the
surviving partnership, with the holders of partnership interests in Prentiss
Partnership receiving in any event units of limited partnership interest in
Mack-Cali Partnership, as set forth herein (the "Partnership Merger" and,
together with the Merger, the "Mergers"). As an alternative to receiving
units of limited partnership interest in Mack-Cali Partnership in connection
with the Partnership Merger, limited partners in Prentiss Partnership (other
than Prentiss) shall have the right to elect, effective immediately prior to
the Partnership Merger, to exercise their exchange right under the Prentiss
Partnership Agreement (as defined herein), regardless of whether or not they
would otherwise be entitled to exercise that exchange right under the
Prentiss Partnership Agreement, and Prentiss shall issue shares of Prentiss
Common Stock (as defined herein) in satisfaction of that right, thereby
allowing former limited partners in Prentiss Partnership (other than
Prentiss) to participate in the Merger as holders of Prentiss Common
Shares.   C. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, immediately prior to the Merger, Mack-Cali Partnership and Prentiss
Partnership shall execute a Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and shall
file such Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware law to effectuate
the Partnership Merger.   D. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, immediately following the effectiveness of the Partnership
Merger, Mack-Cali and Prentiss shall execute Articles of Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
and shall file such Articles of Merger in accordance with Maryland law to
effectuate the Merger.   E. The parties intend that for federal income tax
purposes the Merger shall qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), that
this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368 of
the Code,      and that, following the Merger, Mack-Cali will continue
to be subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") within
the meaning of the Code.   F. For federal income taxes, it is intended that
the Partnership Merger, regardless of form, be treated as a contribution by
Prentiss Partnership of all of its assets to Mack-Cali Partnership in
exchange for partnership interests in Mack-Cali Partnership, as provided for
herein, under Section 721 of the Code, and a distribution of such partnership
interests by Prentiss Partnership to its partners under Section 731 of the
Code.   G. Mack-Cali and Prentiss each have received a fairness
opinion relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as more fully
described herein.   H. Mack-Cali, Mack-Cali Partnership, Prentiss and
Prentiss Partnership desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Mergers.   I. Contemporaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain holders of Prentiss Common
Shares (as defined in Section 1.12(b)(i) of this Agreement) have entered into
voting agreements with Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership (each, a "Prentiss
Voting Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, each holder has
agreed to vote his or its Prentiss Common Shares in favor of the Merger, the
Partnership Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and any other matter which requires his or its vote in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   J. Contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain holders of Mack-Cali
Common Shares (as defined in Section 1.12(b)(i) of this Agreement) and
certain holders of partnership interests in Mack-Cali Partnership have
entered into voting agreements with Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership (each,
a "Mack-Cali Voting Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, each
holder has agreed to vote his or its Mack-Cali Common Shares and Mack-Cali
Units (as defined in Section 3.3(e) of this Agreement) in favor of the
Merger, the Partnership Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and any other matter which requires his or
its vote in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   K. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as an inducement to Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership to
enter into this Agreement, Ampulla, LLC, as the owner of 100% of the voting
capital stock of Prentiss Properties Limited, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary"), have entered into a Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, relating to the voting
capital stock of the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary (the "Stock Purchase
Agreement"), providing for the sale of all of the outstanding voting capital
stock of the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary to certain officers of Mack-
Cali or their assigns.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:    2    
ARTICLE 1  THE MERGERS   1.1 THE MERGER. Subject to the completion of the
Partnership Merger in accordance with Section 1.2 hereof, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law
(the "MGCL"), as amended ("Title 3"), and Title 8 of the Corporations and
Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended ("Title
8"), immediately following the effectiveness of the Partnership Merger,
Prentiss shall be merged with and into Mack-Cali, whereupon the separate
corporate existence of Prentiss shall cease and Mack-Cali shall continue as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 3-114 of the MGCL, Section 8-501.1 of
Title 8 and this Agreement.   1.2 THE PARTNERSHIP MERGER. Immediately prior
to the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Title 6,
Chapter 17 of the Delaware Code Annotated, as amended (the "DRULPA"),
Prentiss Partnership shall be merged with and into Mack-Cali Partnership (or,
at Mack-Cali Partnership\'s option, a limited liability company or a limited
partnership owned entirely, directly and/or indirectly, by Mack-Cali
Partnership, as determined by Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership), whereupon
the separate partnership existence of Prentiss Partnership shall cease and
Mack-Cali Partnership (or such limited partnership or limited liability
company subsidiary) shall continue as the surviving limited partnership or
limited liability company, as the case may be (the "Surviving Partnership"),
and with the holders of partnership interests in Prentiss Partnership
receiving in any event units of partnership interest in Mack-
Cali Partnership, as set forth in Section 1.12(a). The Partnership Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 17-211 of the DRULPA.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain of Prentiss Partnership\'s
Subsidiaries may be merged into Mack-Cali Partnership or certain of Mack-Cali
Partnership\'s Subsidiaries as the parties hereto may mutually agree.   1.3
ELECTION BY LIMITED PARTNERS IN PRENTISS PARTNERSHIP TO EXERCISE THE EXCHANGE
RIGHT; THE PARTNERSHIP MERGER. Notwithstanding any limitation or restriction
contained in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement with respect to the right of
a Limited Partner (as defined in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement)
to exercise the Exchange Right (as defined in the Prentiss Partnership
Agreement) (including, without limitation, any limitation or restriction
contained in Section 8.05 of the Prentiss Partnership Agreement), every
Limited Partner shall have the right to exercise the Exchange Right by
submitting to Prentiss Partnership (with a copy to Prentiss) during the

Partnership Agreement) specifying the number of units of limited partnership
interest of Prentiss Partnership (the "Prentiss Units") which such Limited
Partner desires to have exchanged pursuant to Section 8.05 of the Prentiss
Partnership Agreement (as modified by this Section 1.3(a)), which Notice of
Exchange shall be conditioned upon the closing of the Partnership Merger;
provided, that,   (a) with respect to each Notice of Exchange (a copy of the
form of which shall accompany or form a part of the Form of Election (as
defined herein)) properly submitted by a Limited Partner in accordance with
this Section 1.3(a) (an "Exercise"), Prentiss shall elect in accordance with
Section    3   8.05(b) of the Prentiss Partnership Agreement to purchase
the Prentiss Units relating to such Exercise by paying the REIT Shares Amount
(as defined in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement) and not the Cash Amount
(as defined in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement);   (b) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 8.05(b) of the Prentiss Partnership Agreement,
Prentiss shall not be required to notify the Exchanging Partner (as defined
in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement) of Prentiss\' election to purchase the
Prentiss Units as described in the foregoing clause (a);   (c) The Specified
Exchange Date (as defined in the Prentiss Partnership Agreement) shall be the
Closing Date (as defined herein) at a time prior to the consummation of the
Partnership Merger; and   (d) Each Exchanging Partner shall be treated as an
owner of the Prentiss Common Shares issued pursuant to this Agreement at the
Effective Time (as defined herein) of the Merger.   1.4 CLOSING. The
closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the date to be specified by the parties, which (subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6) shall be no
later than the third business day after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 (the "Closing Date"), at the offices
of Pryor Cashman Sherman and Flynn LLP, 410 Park Avenue, New York, New York

Cali Partnership and Prentiss Partnership shall execute and file the

Agent") for the exchange of the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of certificates representing issued and outstanding Prentiss Common
Shares, Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares, and Prentiss Units, as

Prentiss shall provide to the Exchange Agent on or before the Effective Time,
for the benefit of the holders of Prentiss Common Shares, cash payable in
respect of any dividends required pursuant to Section 1.16(d).   (c)
EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Mack-Cali shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Prentiss Common Shares and Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 1.12 into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Mack-
Cali may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Mack-Cali, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
into which the Prentiss Common Shares or Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares,
as applicable, theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.12, together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.16(d),
and cash, if any, payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section

Preferred Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of Prentiss,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment either shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of such payment being made to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Mack-Cali that
such tax or taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.16, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger    8   Consideration, without interest, into
which the Prentiss Common Shares or Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares, as
applicable, theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.12, and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.16(d). No interest
will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of
any Certificate or on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.16(d) or Section
1.16(g).   (d) RECORD DATES FOR FINAL DIVIDENDS; DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO  UNEXCHANGED SHARES.    (i) To the extent necessary to satisfy the
requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable year of
Prentiss ending at the Effective Time of the Merger (and avoid the payment of
tax with respect to undistributed income), Prentiss shall declare a dividend
(the "Final Company Dividend") to holders of Prentiss Common Shares and
Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares, the record date for which shall be the
close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, in an amount equal to the minimum dividend sufficient to permit
Prentiss to satisfy such requirements, and Prentiss Partnership shall declare
a parallel and equivalent distribution to the holders of the Prentiss Units.
If Prentiss determines it necessary to declare the Final Company Dividend, it
shall notify Mack-Cali at least ten (10) days prior to the date for the
Prentiss Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1), and Mack-Cali
shall declare a dividend per share to holders of Mack-Cali Common Shares, the
record date for which shall be the close of business on the last business day
prior to the Effective Times, in an amount per Mack-Cali Common Share equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Final Company Dividend per
Prentiss Common Share paid by Prentiss by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and Mack-
Cali Partnership shall declare a parallel and equivalent distribution, the
record date for which shall be the close of business on the last business day
prior to the Effective Times, to the holders of the Mack-Cali Common Units
and the distributions to the holders of the Mack-Cali Preferred Units (as
defined in Section 3.3(e)), the record date for which shall be the close of
business on the last business day prior to the Effective Times. The dividends
and distributions payable hereunder shall be payable on the last business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.   (ii) No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Mack-Cali Common Shares with a record date
after the Effective Times shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Mack-Cali Common Shares represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 1.16(g), in each case until the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.16. Subject to the
effect of applicable escheat laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of such Certificate, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of any fractional Mack-Cali Common Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.16(g) and (ii) if such Certificate
is exchangeable for one or more whole Mack-Cali Common Shares, (x) at the
time of such surrender the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Times theretofore paid with respect to such
whole Mack-Cali Common Shares and (y) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Times but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Mack-Cali
Common Shares.   (e) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN PRENTISS COMMON SHARES
AND PRENTISS SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Section
1.16 (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.16(g)) shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Prentiss
Common Shares or Prentiss Series A    9   Preferred Shares, as
applicable, theretofore represented by such Certificates; provided, however,
that Prentiss shall transfer to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Times which may have been declared or made by Prentiss on such
Prentiss Common Shares or Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares, as applicable,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Times and have not been
paid prior to such surrender, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of Prentiss of the Prentiss Common
Shares and Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Times. If, after the Effective Times,
Certificates are presented to Mack-Cali for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 1.16.   (f) NO
LIABILITY. None of Prentiss, Mack-Cali or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration or dividends delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Agreement that remains unclaimed for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be redelivered by the Exchange Agent to
Mack-Cali, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with Section 1.16(c) shall thereafter look only
to Mack-Cali for delivery of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid
dividends, subject to applicable escheat and other similar laws.   (g) NO
FRACTIONAL SHARES.   (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Mack-Cali Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Mack-Cali.   (ii) No fractional Mack-Cali Common Shares shall be
issued pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional
Mack-Cali Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement, each holder of Prentiss
Common Shares upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange shall be paid an
amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by
multiplying (i) the average closing price of one Mack-Cali Common Share on
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on the five trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Fair Market Value") by (ii) the fractional
amount of the Mack-Cali Common Shares which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive under this Section 1.16.   (h) LOST CERTIFICATES. If
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Mack-Cali or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Mack-Cali or
the Exchange Agent may direct (but consistent with the practices Mack-Cali
applies to its own shareholders) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Mack-
Cali Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 1.12, any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.16(g) to which the
holders thereof are entitled and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.16(d).   
10    (i) APPLICABILITY TO PARTNERSHIP MERGER. All provisions of this
Section 1.16 shall apply to Prentiss Partnership, Mack-Cali Partnership and
the Prentiss Common Units and the Prentiss Preferred Units with respect to
the Partnership Merger.   ARTICLE 2  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER OF PRENTISS. Prentiss is a real estate
investment trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the state of Maryland. Prentiss has all requisite power
and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on
its business as now being conducted. Prentiss\' Declaration of Trust is in

Prentiss have been commenced. Prentiss is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
the business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of
operations of Prentiss and the Prentiss Subsidiaries (as defined below),
taken as a whole (a "Prentiss Material Adverse Effect"). A Prentiss Material
Adverse Effect shall not include (i) the effects related to general economic

real estate investment trusts generally and changes that affect office real
estate generally or (ii) the effects specified in Section 2.5(c) with respect

Agreement, "Subsidiary" of any Person (as defined below) means any
corporation, partnership, limited    11   liability company, joint
venture, trust or other legal entity of which such Person owns (either
directly or through or together with another Subsidiary of such Person)
either (1) a general partner, managing member or other similar interest, or
(2) (x) 10% or more of the voting power of the voting capital stock or other

Subsidiary or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary and (C) owned free and clear
of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Prentiss Material Adverse
Effect. Complete and correct copies of the articles of incorporation, bylaws,
organizational documents and partnership, joint venture and operating
agreements of each Prentiss Subsidiary and Prentiss Non-
controlled Subsidiary, as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been
previously delivered or made available to Mack-Cali. No effective amendment

Prentiss SEC Documents filed by Prentiss with the SEC since January 1, 1998
and on or prior to the date of this Agreement. All of the Prentiss SEC
Documents (other than preliminary material or material subsequently amended),

all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and,
in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to

complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects, in
accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position of Prentiss
and the Prentiss Subsidiaries (including Prentiss Partnership) taken as a
whole, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and

Subsidiaries which are not consolidated for accounting purposes. Except for
liabilities and obligations set forth in the Prentiss SEC Documents or in
Schedule 2.6(c) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, none of Prentiss, any
Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of Prentiss or in the notes thereto and which,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Prentiss Material Adverse
Effect.   2.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as disclosed in

financial condition or results of operations of Prentiss    16   and

occurrence or circumstance that with the passage of time would reasonably be
expected to result in a Prentiss Material Adverse Change, (b) any
authorization, declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any shares

distributions not in excess of $0.485 per Prentiss Series A Preferred Share,

case with customary record and payment dates or (ii) any final Prentiss and
corresponding Prentiss Partnership distribution contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) any split, combination or reclassification of shares of
Prentiss\' beneficial interest or any issuance or the authorization of any
issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution
for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of
beneficial interest of Prentiss or partnership interests in Prentiss
Partnership or any issuance of an ownership interest in, any Prentiss
Subsidiary or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary, (d) any damage, destruction
or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that has or would have a
Prentiss Material Adverse Effect, (e) any change in accounting
methods, principles or practices by Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the

Subsidiaries (a) which are substantially covered by insurance or (b)
for which all material costs and liabilities arising therefrom are
reimbursable pursuant to common area maintenance or similar agreements, there
is no suit, action or proceeding pending (in which service of process has
been received by an employee of Prentiss, a Prentiss Subsidiary or a Prentiss
Non-controlled Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of Prentiss (as hereinafter
defined), threatened in writing against or affecting Prentiss or any Prentiss
Subsidiary or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary that, individually or in the

Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any court or Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-

("Encumbrances"). Schedule 2.2(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter further
identifies which of the Prentiss Properties are owned in fee simple by
Prentiss or the Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary
and which of the Prentiss Properties are subject to a ground lease. Except as
set forth in Schedule 2.2(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, no other
Person has any ownership interest in any of the Prentiss Properties, and any
such ownership interest so scheduled does not materially detract from the
value of the Prentiss Subsidiary\'s or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary\'s
(as the case may be) interest in, or materially interfere with the present
use of, any of the Prentiss Properties subject thereto or affected thereby.
Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter,
none of the Prentiss Properties is subject to any restriction on the sale or
other disposition thereof or on the financing or release of
financing thereon. The Prentiss Properties are not subject to any rights of

"Property Restrictions") or Encumbrances, except for (i) Property
Restrictions and Encumbrances set forth in the Prentiss Disclosure Letter,
(ii) Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or any governmental
or authority with respect to real property, including zoning regulations,
which do not materially adversely affect the current use of any Prentiss
Property, (iii) Property Restrictions and Encumbrances disclosed on existing
title reports or existing surveys or subsequently granted by Prentiss or the
Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary, which Property
Restrictions and Encumbrances, in any event, do not materially detract from
the value of, or materially interfere with the present use of, any of the
Prentiss Properties subject thereto or affected thereby and (iv) liens for
real estate taxes not yet due and payable, mechanics\', carriers\',
workmen\'s, repairmen\'s liens and other Encumbrances and Property
Restrictions, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, do not
materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the present
use of any of the Prentiss Property subject thereto or affected thereby.
Schedule 2.9(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter lists each of the Prentiss
Properties which are under development as of the date of this Agreement and
describes the status of such development as of the date hereof.   (b) Except
as provided in Schedule 2.2(a) or Schedule 2.9(b) to the Prentiss Disclosure
Letter, valid policies of title insurance have been issued insuring the
applicable Prentiss Subsidiary\'s or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary\'s
(as the case may be) fee simple title or leasehold estate, as the case may
be, to the Prentiss Properties owned by it in amounts at least equal to the
purchase price therefor paid by such Prentiss Subsidiary or Prentiss Non-
controlled Subsidiary at the time of acquisition of such Prentiss Properties.
To Prentiss\' Knowledge, such policies are, at the date hereof, in full force
and effect. No material claim has been made against any such policy.   (c)
Except as provided in Schedule 2.9(c) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, to
the Knowledge of Prentiss, there does not exist (i) any certificate, permit
or license from any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any of
the Prentiss Properties or any agreement, easement or other right which

and improvements on any of the Prentiss Properties or which is necessary to
permit the lawful use and operation of all driveways, roads and other means
of egress and ingress to and from any of the Prentiss Properties that has not
been obtained and is not in full force and effect, other than with respect to
such certificates, permits, licenses, agreements, easement or other rights,
the failure of which to have or maintain would not have a Prentiss Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any written notice of any violation of any federal,
state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or requirement
materially and adversely affecting any of the Prentiss   
18   Properties issued by any governmental authority which would have a
Prentiss Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any structural defect or defects
relating to any Prentiss Property, Prentiss Properties whose building systems
are not in working order, any physical damage to any Prentiss Property for
which there is no insurance in effect covering a substantial portion of the
cost of the restoration, except such structural defects, building systems not
in working order, physical damage, renovation and restoration which, in the
aggregate, would not have a Prentiss Material Adverse Effect.   (d) None of
Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary
has received any written or published notice to the effect that (i) any
condemnation or rezoning proceedings are pending or threatened with respect
to any of the Prentiss Properties or (ii) any zoning, building or similar
law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will be violated by the
continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other
improvements on any of the Prentiss Properties or by the
continued maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas other than such
notices which, in the aggregate, would not have a Prentiss Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(d) or 4.1(i) to the Prentiss
Disclosure Letter, all work required to be performed, payments required to be
made and actions required to be taken, other than those which would not have
a Prentiss Material Adverse Effect, prior to the date hereof pursuant to any
agreement entered into with a governmental body or authority in connection
with a site approval, zoning reclassification or other similar action
relating to any Prentiss Properties (e.g., Local Improvement District, Road
Improvement District, Environmental Mitigation) have been performed, paid or
taken, as the case may be, except where the failure to do so would not, in
the aggregate, have a Prentiss Material Adverse Effect, and Prentiss has no
Knowledge of any planned or proposed work, payments or actions that may be
required after the date hereof pursuant to such agreements, except as set
forth in development or operating budgets for such Prentiss Properties
delivered to Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership prior to the date hereof and
except for such work, payments or actions which, in the aggregate, would not
have a Prentiss Material Adverse Effect.   (e) The rent rolls requested by
Mack-Cali and previously provided by Prentiss to Mack-Cali (the "Prentiss
Rent Roll") lists substantially all Prentiss Space Leases (as defined below)
in effect as of the respective dates indicated on such Prentiss Rent Rolls
except for Prentiss Space Leases for which the payment of rent has not
commenced. "Prentiss Space Lease" means each lease or other right of
occupancy affecting or relating to a property in which Prentiss Partnership
(or an entity in which it directly or indirectly has an interest) is the
landlord, either pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement or as successor
to any prior landlord, but excluding any ground lease. Those copies of
Prentiss Space Leases made available to Mack-Cali are true, correct and
complete copies of all such Prentiss Space Leases, including all
amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals, extensions and guarantees
related thereto, as of the date hereof. Except for discrepancies that, either

Prentiss Material Adverse Effect, all information set forth in the Prentiss
Rent Roll is true, correct and complete as of the date thereof. Except as set
forth in a delinquency report made available to Mack-Cali, none of Prentiss
or any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary, on the
one hand, nor, to the Knowledge of Prentiss or Prentiss Partnership, any
other party, on the other hand, is in monetary default under any Prentiss
Space Lease, except for such defaults that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Prentiss Material Adverse Effect.    19      2.10

With respect to the Prentiss Employee Plans:   (a) Except as disclosed in
Schedule 2.12(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, no Prentiss ERISA

not occurred, and no person or entity is contractually bound to enter into,
any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which transaction is not exempt under Section
4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA and (ii) there has not occurred
any breach of fiduciary duty under Title I of ERISA, which in either case
could subject Prentiss or any Prentiss ERISA Affiliate to material
liability.   (d) No Prentiss ERISA Affiliate has maintained or been
obligated to contribute to any Pension Plan subject to Code Section 412 or

Policies.  -----------------------------   (a) The employee handbooks of
Prentiss, the Prentiss Subsidiaries and the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary currently in effect are attached as Schedule 2.13 to the Prentiss
Disclosure Letter and fairly and accurately summarize all material employee
policies, vacation policies and payroll policies. Schedule 2.13(a) to the
Prentiss Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, true and correct in all
material respects, of the names of all current employees of Prentiss, any
Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary (each a
"Prentiss Controlled Group Member") (including employees who are
also directors or officers of any Prentiss Controlled Group Member) (the
"Prentiss Employees") all of whom are located in the United States and with
respect to each such Employee, such person\'s job title, the location of
employment of such Prentiss Employee, such Prentiss Employee\'s date of
employment, and the current salary and bonus paid in 1999. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 2.13(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter and except
for travel advances which have been granted in the ordinary course of
business, there are no outstanding loans from any Prentiss Controlled Group
Member to any Prentiss Employee, former employee, consultant or any related
party. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.13(a) to the Prentiss Disclosure
Letter, the Prentiss Controlled Group Members do not have any employment or
other compensation agreements with any Prentiss Employees or former
employees. To Prentiss\' Knowledge, Prentiss is not in breach of any material
terms of any such employment agreements of any of the Prentiss Employees.  
(b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.13(b) to the Prentiss
Disclosure Letter, there are no material controversies, strikes, slowdowns,
lockouts, work stoppages, picketing, grievances, unfair labor practice
charges, investigations, charges, complaints, disputes or other proceedings
pending or threatened between any Prentiss Controlled Group Member and any of
the Prentiss Employees or former employees.   2.14 Taxes.  -----   (a)
Each of Prentiss, the Prentiss Subsidiaries and the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary (i) has filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by
it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a
Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such returns
and reports are accurate and complete in all material respects, (B) has paid
(or Prentiss has paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined herein) shown on
such returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and (C) has complied
in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without
limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections    23   1441,
1442, 1445, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under
any foreign laws) and has, within the time period prescribed by law, withheld
and paid over to the proper governmental entities all amounts required to be
so withheld and paid over under applicable laws and regulations, except,
with respect to all of the foregoing, where the failure to file such tax
returns and reports or failure to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with
such withholding requirements would not reasonably be expected to have a
Prentiss Material Adverse Effect. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the Prentiss SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve for all material Taxes payable by Prentiss, the Prentiss Subsidiaries
and the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the
Prentiss Financial Statement Date, Prentiss has incurred no liability for
Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without
limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code, and none of Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the
Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for
Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business. No event has occurred,
and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that
any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon
Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary.
None of Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in
respect of federal income Taxes, and to the Knowledge of Prentiss, no audit,
examination or other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes involving
any of Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority. To the Knowledge of
Prentiss, no deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-
controlled Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any such Taxes are pending. As used in this Agreement, "Taxes" shall include
all taxes, charges, fees, levies and other assessments, including,
without limitation, income, gross receipts, excise, property, sales,
withholding (including, without limitation, dividend withholding and
withholding required pursuant to Sections 1445 and 1446 of the Code), social
security, occupation, use, service, license, payroll, franchise, transfer and
recording taxes, fees and charges, including estimated taxes, imposed by the
United States or any taxing authority (domestic or foreign), whether computed
on a separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other basis, and any
interest, fines, penalties or additional amounts attributable to, or imposed
upon, or with respect to any such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other
assessments.   (b) Prentiss (i) since its formation and through December 31,
1999, has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section
856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for
such years, (ii) has operated since January 1, 2000, to the date of this
representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000 and, if
later, for the taxable year of Prentiss ending on the Closing Date, and (iii)
has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be
expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT and no such
challenge is pending or, to the Knowledge of Prentiss, threatened. Each
Prentiss Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company (1) has been treated since its formation and continues to
be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as
a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation and (2) has not
since the later of its formation or the acquisition by Prentiss of a direct
or indirect interest therein, owned any assets (including, without
limitation, securities) that would cause Prentiss to violate Section
856(c)(5) of the Code. Each Prentiss Subsidiary which is a corporation (other
than Prentiss Services Company) has been since its formation a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code. Prentiss Partnership is not a
publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.
Neither Prentiss nor any Prentiss Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the
disposition of which would be    24   subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under IRS Notice 88-19 or
Temporary Treasury Regulation sec. 1.337(d)-5T or (y) which is subject to a
consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder.   2.15 NO PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS. Except
as described in Schedule 2.15 to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, or as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement, there is no employment or severance
contract, or other agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness
or other obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise as a
result of the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or as a result of a termination of service subsequent to the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with
respect to any employee, officer or director of Prentiss, any Prentiss
Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary. Except as described in
Schedule 2.15 to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, there is no agreement or
arrangement with any employee, officer or other service provider under which
Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary has
agreed to pay any tax that might be owed under Section 4999 of the Code with
respect to payments to such individuals.   2.16 BROKER; SCHEDULE OF FEES

person, other than Lazard Freres and Co. LLC, the fees and expenses of which

given to Mack-Cali, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial
advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary.   2.17 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
None of Prentiss, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity

that such violation or failure would not reasonably be expected to have a
Prentiss Material Adverse Effect.   2.18 CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary is in violation of or in
default under (nor to the Knowledge of Prentiss does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would cause such a violation of or default under) any material loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession,
franchise, license or any other material contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties
or assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of Prentiss does such a violation or
default exist, except to the extent that such violation or default,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Prentiss Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except for any of the following
expressly identified in Prentiss SEC Documents, Schedule 2.18(b) to the
Prentiss Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each material loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture and any other agreement or

with respect to any of the Prentiss Properties.   (e) Except as described
in Schedule 2.18(e) to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter, none of Prentiss, any
Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary is a party to

arising therefrom are reimbursable pursuant to common area maintenance or
similar agreements, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending (in which
service of process has been received by an employee of Mack-Cali, a Mack-Cali
Subsidiary or Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of
Mack-Cali (as hereinafter defined), threatened in writing against or

Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary and which of the Mack-
Cali Properties are subject to a ground lease. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.2 to the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter, no other Person has
any ownership interest in any of the Mack-Cali Properties, and any such

any of the Mack-Cali Properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Except

Mack-Cali Properties subject thereto or affected thereby and (iv) liens for
real estate taxes not yet due and payable, mechanics\', carriers\',
workmen\'s, repairmen\'s liens and other Encumbrances and Property
Restrictions, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, do not

order, regulation or requirement materially and adversely affecting any of
the Mack-Cali Properties issued by any governmental authority which would
have a Mack-Cali Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any structural defect or

Cali Property for which there is no insurance in effect covering
a substantial portion of the cost of the restoration, except such
structural defects, building systems not in working order, physical damage,
renovation and restoration which, in the aggregate, would not have a Mack-
Cali Material Adverse Effect.   (d) None of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali

written or published notice to the effect that (i) any condemnation or
rezoning proceedings are pending or threatened with respect to any of the

35   continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other
improvements on any of the Mack-Cali Properties or by the continued

approval, zoning reclassification or similar action relating to any Mack-Cali
Properties (e.g., Local Improvement District, Road Improvement District,
Environmental Mitigation), have been performed, paid or taken, as the case
may be, except where the failure to do so would not, in the aggregate, have a
Mack-Cali Material Adverse Effect, and Mack-Cali has no Knowledge of any
planned or proposed work, payments or actions that may be required after the
date hereof pursuant to such agreements, except as set forth in development
or operating budgets for such Mack-Cali Properties delivered to Prentiss and
Prentiss Partnership prior to the date hereof and except for such work,

which any Mack-Cali ERISA Affiliate (or any of the rights, properties or
assets thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect to which any current Mack-Cali

Cali Disclosure Letter. With respect to the Mack-Cali Employee Plans:   (a)
Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.12(a) to the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter,
no Mack-Cali ERISA Affiliate has any continuing liability under any Welfare
Plan or other Mack-Cali Employee Plan which provides for continuing benefits
or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant after
such participant\'s termination of employment, except as may be required

Disclosure Letter, each Mack-Cali Employee Plan complies in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA and any other applicable
law governing such Mack-Cali Employee Plan, and, to the Knowledge of Mack-
Cali, each Mack-Cali Employee Plan has at all times been properly
administered in all material respects in accordance with all such
requirements of law, and in accordance with its terms and the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all
such requirements of law. Each Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified

determination letter from the IRS stating that such Plan meets the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust associated with
such Plan is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code or has pending an
application for such a letter and, to the Knowledge of Mack-Cali, no event
has occurred which would jeopardize the qualified status of any such plan or
the tax exempt status of any such trust under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively. Except as described in Schedule
3.12(b) to the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter, no lawsuits, claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) or complaints to, or by, any person or

Mack-Cali, are threatened with respect to any Mack-Cali Employee Plan and, to
the Knowledge of Mack-Cali, there is no fact or contemplated event which
would be expected to give rise to any such lawsuit, claim (other than routine
claims for benefits) or complaint with respect to any Pension Plan. Without

all contributions and payments with respect to Mack-Cali  Employee Plans that
are required to be made by a Mack-Cali ERISA  Affiliate with respect to
periods ending on or before the Closing Date  (including periods from the
first day of the current plan or policy  year to the Closing Date) have been,
or will be, made or accrued before  the Closing Date in accordance with   
38    the appropriate plan document, actuarial report, collective
bargaining  agreements or insurance contracts or arrangements or as
otherwise  required by ERISA or the Code; and   (ii) with respect to each
such Mack-Cali Employee Plan, to the  extent applicable, Mack-Cali has

documents that establish the  existence of the plan, trust, arrangement,
contract, policy or  commitment and all amendments thereto, (B) the most

Employee Plan (i) there has not occurred, and no person or entity is
contractually bound to enter into, any "prohibited transaction" within the
meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which
transaction is not exempt under Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section 408 of

or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.   (e) With respect to each Mack-Cali Employee Plan
maintained by any Mack-Cali ERISA Affiliate, such Plans provide the Plan
Sponsor the authority to amend or terminate the plan at any time, subject to
applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code.   (f) Each Pension Plan that
is not qualified under Code section 401(a) or 403(a) is exempt from Part 2,

primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees, pursuant to Sections
201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) ERISA. Except as set forth on Schedule

EMPLOYEES / EMPLOYEE POLICIES.   (a) The employee handbooks of Mack-Cali,
the Mack-Cali Subsidiaries and the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary
currently in effect are attached as Schedule 3.13 to the Mack-Cali Disclosure
Letter and fairly and accurately summarize all material employee policies,
vacation policies and payroll policies. Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a list,
true and correct in all material respects, of the names of all current
employees of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-
controlled Subsidiary (each a "Mack-Cali Controlled Group Member") (including
employees who are also directors or officers of any Mack-Cali Controlled
Group Member) (the "Mack-Cali Employees") all of whom are located in the
United States and with respect to each such Employee, such person\'s job
title, the location of employment of such Mack-Cali Employee, such Mack-Cali
Employee\'s date of employment, and the current salary and bonus paid in
1999. Except for travel advances which have been granted in the   
39   ordinary course of business, there are no outstanding loans from any
Mack-Cali Controlled Group Member to any Mack-Cali Employee, former employee,
consultant or any related party. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(a), the
Mack-Cali Controlled Group Members do not have any employment or other
compensation agreements with any Mack-Cali Employees or former employees. To
Mack-Cali\'s Knowledge, Mack-Cali is not in breach of any material terms of
any such employment agreements of any of the Mack-Cali Employees.   (b)
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(b), there are no material controversies,
strikes, slowdowns, lockouts, work stoppages, picketing, grievances, unfair
labor practice charges, investigations, charges, complaints, disputes or
other proceedings pending or threatened between any Mack-Cali Controlled
Group Member and any of the Mack-Cali Employees or former employees.   3.14
TAXES.   (a) Each of Mack-Cali, the Mack-Cali Subsidiaries and the Mack-
Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary (i) has filed all Tax returns and reports
required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all
such returns and reports are accurate and complete in all material respects,
(B) has paid (or Mack-Cali has paid on its behalf) all Taxes shown on such
returns and reports as required to be paid by it, and (C) has complied in all
material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to
the payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation,
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 3121, and 3402 of
the Code or similar provisions under any foreign laws) and has, within the
time period prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to the proper
governmental entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over
under applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of the
foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns and reports or failure
to pay such Taxes or failure to comply with such withholding requirements
would not reasonably be expected to have a Mack-Cali Material Adverse Effect.
The most recent audited financial statements contained in the Mack-Cali SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by Mack-
Cali, the Mack-Cali Subsidiaries and the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary
for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such
financial statements. Since the Mack-Cali Financial Statement Date, Mack-Cali
has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of
the Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited
transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and none of Mack-
Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary
course of business. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary
or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary. None of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali
Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary is the subject of any
audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes,
and to the Knowledge of Mack-Cali, no audit, examination or other proceeding
in respect of federal income Taxes involving any of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali
Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary is being considered by
any Tax authority. To the Knowledge of Mack-Cali, no deficiencies for any
Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Mack-Cali, any Mack-
Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary, and no requests
for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending.   (b) Mack-
Cali (i) since its formation and through December 31, 1999 has been subject
to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has
satisfied all requirements to    40   qualify as a REIT for such years,
(ii) has operated since January 1, 2000, to the date of this representation,
and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT
for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000 and, if later, for the taxable
year of Mack-Cali ending on the Closing Date, and (iii) has not taken or
omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge to its status as a REIT and no such challenge is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Mack-Cali, threatened. Each Mack-Cali Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company (1) has been treated
since its formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership and not as a corporation or an association taxable
as a corporation and (2) has not since the later of its formation or
the acquisition by Mack-Cali of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned
any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause Mack-
Cali to violate Section 856(c)(5) of the Code. Each Mack-Cali Subsidiary
which is a corporation (other than Mack-Cali Services Inc.) has been since
its formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code.
Mack-Cali Partnership is not a publicly traded partnership within the meaning
of Section 7704 of the Code. Neither Mack-Cali nor any Mack-Cali Subsidiary
holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules
similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election under IRS
Notice 88-19 or Temporary Treasury Regulation sec. 1.337(d)-5T or (y) which
is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.   3.15 NO PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS OR
DIRECTORS. Except as described in Schedule 3.15 to the Mack-Cali Disclosure
Letter, or as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, there is no
employment or severance contract, or other agreement requiring payments,
cancellation of indebtedness or other obligation to be made on a change of
control or otherwise as a result of the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a termination
of service subsequent to the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any employee, officer or
director of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-
controlled Subsidiary. Except as described in Schedule 3.15 to the Mack-
Cali Disclosure Letter, there is no agreement or arrangement with any
employee, officer or other service provider under which Mack-Cali, any Mack-
Cali Subsidiary or Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary has agreed to pay any
tax that might be owed under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to
payments to such individuals.   3.16 BROKER; SCHEDULE OF FEES AND EXPENSES.
No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than
Prudential Securities Incorporated, the fees and expenses of which are
described in the engagement letter between Prudential Securities Incorporated
and Mack-Cali, a true, correct and complete copy of which has previously been
given to Prentiss, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial
advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Mack-Cali or any Mack-Cali Subsidiary.   3.17 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. None
of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity
applicable to its business, properties or operations, except to the extent
that such violation or failure would not reasonably be expected to have a
Mack-Cali Material Adverse Effect.   3.18 CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  
(a) Except for any violation or default caused by the
transactions contemplated by this    41   Agreement, none of Mack-Cali,
any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary is in
violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of Mack-Cali does
there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any material
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit,
concession, franchise, license or any other material contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of Mack-Cali does
such a violation or default exist, except to the extent that such violation
or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Mack-Cali Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except for any
of the following expressly identified in Mack-Cali SEC Documents, Schedule
3.18(b) to the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each material
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture and any other
agreement or instrument pursuant to which any indebtedness of Mack-Cali, any
Mack-Cali Subsidiary and the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary, other than
Indebtedness payable to Mack-Cali, a Mack-Cali Subsidiary or a Mack-Cali Non-

3.18(d) of the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter, none of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali
Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement which would restrict any of them from prepaying any of their
Indebtedness without penalty or premium at any time or which requires any of
them to maintain any amount of Indebtedness with respect to any of the Mack-
Cali Properties.   (e) Except as described in Schedule 3.18(e) to the Mack-
Cali Disclosure Letter, none of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the
Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary is a party to any agreement relating to
the management of any Mack-Cali Property by any Person other than Mack-Cali,
a Mack-Cali Subsidiary or a Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary.   (f)

material respects as of the date hereof, lists all agreements currently in
effect entered into by Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali

3.18(j) to the Mack-Cali Disclosure Letter, none of Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali
Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary has entered into or is
subject, directly or indirectly, to any Mack-Cali Tax Protection Agreements.
As used herein, a "Mack-Cali Tax Protection Agreement" is an agreement, oral
or written, (A) that has as one of its purposes to permit a person or entity
to take the position that such person or entity could defer federal taxable

a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and that (i) prohibits or
restricts in any manner the disposition of any assets of Mack-Cali, any Mack-
Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled Subsidiary, (ii) requires
that Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled
Subsidiary maintain, or put in place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or
not secured by one or more of the Mack-Cali Properties, or (iii) requires
that Mack-Cali, any Mack-Cali Subsidiary or the Mack-Cali Non-controlled

this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, Prentiss agrees, for
itself and in its capacity as sole general partner of Prentiss Partnership,
that:   (i) none of it, any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-
controlled Subsidiary shall invite, initiate, solicit or encourage,
directly or indirectly, any inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer (including,
without limitation, any proposal or offer to its shareholders) with respect
to a merger, acquisition, tender offer, exchange offer, transaction resulting
in the issuance of securities representing 25% or more of the outstanding
equity securities of Prentiss, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, business combination, sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25% or
more of the assets or 25% or more of the equity securities (including,
without limitation, partnership interests and units) of Prentiss or Prentiss
Partnership, other than the Mergers (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as a "Prentiss Acquisition Proposal"), or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with or provide any confidential or non-
public information or data to, any person relating to, or that may reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Prentiss Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise
facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Prentiss Acquisition
Proposal;   (ii) none of it, Prentiss Partnership, any of the
Prentiss Subsidiaries or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary will permit
any of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders,
consultants or other agents or representatives of Prentiss to engage in any
of the activities described in Section 4.3(a);   (iii) it, Prentiss
Partnership and the Prentiss Subsidiaries and the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing and will take the necessary steps to
inform the individuals or entities referred to in Section 4.3(b) of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3; and   (iv) it will notify Mack-
Cali immediately (but in any event within 24 hours) if Prentiss, Prentiss
Partnership, any of the Prentiss Subsidiaries, the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary or any individual or entity referred to in Section 4.3(a)(ii),
receives any such inquiries or proposals, or any requests for such
information, or if any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued with it, and include in such notice the identity of
the Person making such inquiry, proposal or request, the material terms of
such inquiry, proposal or request and, if in writing, shall promptly deliver
to Mack-Cali a copy of such inquiry, proposal or request along with all other
related documentation and correspondence;   (b) Notwithstanding Section
4.3(a), the Board of Trustees of Prentiss (including with respect to
Prentiss\' capacity, through a direct wholly-owned subsidiary, as the sole
general partner of Prentiss Partnership) shall not be prohibited from
furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person or entity that makes an unsolicited bona fide written Prentiss
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the extent that (i) a majority of the
Board of Trustees of Prentiss determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that such action is required for the Board of
Trustees of Prentiss to comply with its duties to stockholders imposed by
applicable law, (ii) prior to    50   furnishing such information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity,
Prentiss provides written notice to Mack-Cali to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions with such person or
entity and (iii) Prentiss enters into a confidentiality agreement with such
Person on terms in the aggregate not more favorable to such Person than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(b), in the event that a
Prentiss Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as
defined herein), nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the
Board of Trustees of Prentiss from withdrawing, modifying, amending or
qualifying its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger as required
under Section 5.1(d) hereof and recommending such Superior Acquisition
Proposal to its shareholders: (i) if but only if, Prentiss: (A) complies
fully with this Section 4.3 and (B) provides Mack-Cali with at least three
(3) business days\' prior written notice of its intent to withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify its recommendation of this Merger Agreement and the
Merger, (ii) if, in the event that during such three (3) business days Mack-
Cali makes a counter proposal to such Superior Acquisition Proposal (any such
counter proposal being referred to in this Agreement as the "Mack-Cali
Counter Proposal"), Prentiss\' Board of Trustees in good faith, taking into
account the advice of its outside financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation, determines that the Mack-Cali Counter Proposal is not at least as
favorable to Prentiss\' shareholders as the Superior Acquisition Proposal,
from a financial point of view, and (iii) Prentiss shall have terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h).   (d) For all purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Acquisition Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, Prentiss and/or
Prentiss Partnership pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, merger, share
exchange, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Prentiss, Prentiss Partnership, and the Prentiss Subsidiaries or otherwise
(i) on terms which a majority of the Board of Trustees of Prentiss determines
in good faith, taking into account the advice of Prentiss\' financial
advisors of nationally recognized reputation, are superior, from a financial
point of view, to Prentiss\' shareholders to those provided for in the
Merger, (ii) for which financing, to the extent required, is then
fully committed and capable of being obtained and (iii) which the Board of
Trustees of Prentiss determines in good faith is reasonably capable of being
consummated.   (e) Any disclosure that the Board of Trustees of Prentiss may
be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a Prentiss Acquisition
Proposal in order to comply with its duties to shareholders imposed by
applicable law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the Exchange Act will not constitute
a violation of this Section 4.3.   (f) Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall
(i) permit Prentiss to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly provided
in Article 7) or (ii) affect any other obligations of Prentiss under this
Agreement.   4.4 AFFILIATES. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
Prentiss shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Mack-Cali a list
(reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Mack-Cali) identifying all persons
who, at the time of the Prentiss and Mack-Cali Shareholders Meetings, may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of Prentiss as that term is used in paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Affiliates"). Prentiss
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person who is
identified as an Affiliate in such list to deliver to Mack-Cali on or prior
to the Effective Time a written agreement, in the form previously approved by
the parties hereto, that such Affiliate will not sell, pledge,   
51   transfer or otherwise dispose of any Mack-Cali Common Shares and New
Mack-Cali Units issued to such Affiliate pursuant to the Mergers, except
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
in compliance with paragraph (d) of Rule 145 or as otherwise permitted by the
Securities Act. Mack-Cali shall be entitled to place legends as specified in
such written agreements on the certificates representing any Mack-Cali Common
Shares or New Mack-Cali Units to be received pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement by such Affiliates who have executed such agreements and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Mack-
Cali Common Shares or New Mack-Cali Units issued to such Affiliates,
consistent with the terms of such agreements. The Surviving Corporation shall
timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it will take
such further action as any Affiliate of Prentiss or Mack-Cali may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such
Affiliate to sell shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
received by such Affiliate in the Merger without registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to (i) Rule 145(d)(1) under the Securities Act, as
such rule may be amended from to time, or (ii) any successor rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.   4.5 OTHER ACTIONS. Each of
Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership on the one hand, and Mack-Cali and Mack-
Cali Partnership on the other hand, shall not take, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective subsidiaries and
joint ventures not to take, any action that would result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of such party set forth in this Agreement that
are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of
such representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue
in any material respect or (iii) except as contemplated by Section 4.3, any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 not being
satisfied.   4.6 M-C REIT SUBSIDIARY MERGER. Anything in Section 4.2(h),
Section 4.2(j) or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, but subject to the requirements that the transactions
contemplated in this Section 4.6 shall not be a condition to the Mergers and
shall not materially alter the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Mack-Cali may, prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger: (i)
form a Maryland real estate investment trust under Title 8 having a
declaration of trust and bylaws as will be mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto, as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Mack-Cali (the "M-C REIT
Subsidiary"); and (ii) effect a merger (the "M-C REIT Subsidiary Merger") of
Mack-Cali with and into the M-C REIT Subsidiary, with the M-C REIT Subsidiary
being the surviving entity, substantially upon the terms and conditions set
forth in an agreement and plan of merger and articles of merger that will be
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto (collectively the "M-C REIT
Subsidiary Merger Documents"). Any such M-C REIT Subsidiary Merger shall have
the effects set forth in Section 3-114 of the MGCL, Section 8-501.1 of Title
8 and the M-C REIT Subsidiary Merger Documents, and upon consummation of the
M-C REIT Subsidiary Merger, the M-C REIT Subsidiary will, among other things,
be liable for all of the debts and obligations of Mack-Cali
including, without limitation, the obligations of Mack-Cali under this
Agreement. If the M-C REIT Subsidiary Merger is consummated prior to the
Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, then the Merger shall consist of
the merger of Prentiss with and into the M-C REIT Subsidiary with the M-C
REIT Subsidiary being the surviving entity, and the Merger Consideration, to
the extent that it consists of Mack-Cali Common Shares or Mack-Cali Series A
Preferred Shares, will instead consist of a like number of common shares of
beneficial interest of the M-C REIT Subsidiary ("M-C REIT Subsidiary Common
Shares") and a like number of Series A preferred shares of beneficial
interest of the M-C REIT Subsidiary ("M-C REIT Subsidiary Series A Preferred
Shares"), respectively.    52    ARTICLE 5  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

extent required.   5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to
the requirements of confidentiality agreements with third parties, each of
the parties shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (and, in the case
of Prentiss, the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary) to, afford to the other
parties and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of such other parties, reasonable access
during normal business hours prior to the Effective Time to their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of the parties shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries (and, in the case of Prentiss, the Prentiss Non-controlled
Subsidiary) to, furnish promptly to the other parties (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other relevant information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request. Each of the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (and, in
the case of Prentiss, the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary) to, cause its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives and affiliates to, hold any nonpublic information in
confidence.   5.3 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.   (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another
in (A) determining which filings are required to be made prior to
the Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from,
governmental or regulatory authorities of the United States, the several
states and foreign jurisdictions and any third parties in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits and authorizations; (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts (other than the payment    55   of
money which is not contractually required to be paid) to obtain in
writing any consents required from third parties to effectuate the Mergers,
such consents to be in form reasonably satisfactory to each of the parties;
and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other action and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purpose of this
Agreement, each party shall take all such necessary action.   (b) Prentiss
and Prentiss Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, access to all work papers relating to
audits of Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership performed
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and the continued cooperation
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, with regard to the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for the Surviving Corporation.   (c)
Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership shall give prompt notice to Mack-Cali and
Mack-Cali Partnership, and Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership shall give
prompt notice to Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership, (i) if any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becomes untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) of the failure by it to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.   5.4 TAX MATTERS. Each of
Mack-Cali and Prentiss shall use its commercially reasonable efforts before
and after the Effective Time to cause the Merger, and the related M-C REIT
Subsidiary Merger as described in Section 4.6 (if applicable), to qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a) of the Code and to
obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(e). If,
based upon the advice of counsel, Mack-Cali and Prentiss determine that the
Partnership Merger could reasonably be expected to create a risk that the
Merger would not qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Code, Mack-Cali and Prentiss undertake to use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate and structure an alternative means to effect
the Merger, for Mack-Cali to acquire the interest in Prentiss Partnership
owned by Prentiss, and for the holders of Prentiss Units to receive Mack-Cali
Common Units (or the economic and tax equivalent thereof) in exchange for
their Prentiss Units. Mack-Cali Partnership will use the "traditional method"
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) for purposes of
making allocations under Section 704(c) of the Code with respect to the
properties of or interests in Prentiss Partnership as of the Effective Time
(with no curative allocations of gross income with respect to depreciation to
offset the effects of the "ceiling rule" but with a curative allocation of
gain upon disposition of such properties to offset the effect of the "ceiling
rule"). Mack-Cali Partnership and Prentiss Partnership shall negotiate in
good faith to agree upon the "Section 704(c) values" of the properties of
Prentiss Partnership, effective as of the Closing Date. For purposes of
allocating "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of Mack-Cali Partnership pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) following the Closing Date,
Mack-Cali Partnership shall use a methodology to be agreed upon between Mack-
Cali Partnership and Prentiss Partnership.   5.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Each
party will consult with each other party before issuing, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
written    56   public statements which address in any manner the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such written public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be in the
form mutually agreed to by the parties prior to the execution of this
Agreement.   5.6 LISTING. Mack-Cali shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Mack-Cali Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and
upon conversion of the Mack-Cali Series A Preferred Shares and the Mack-Cali
Common Shares reserved for issuance upon redemption of Mack-Cali Common Units
issued in the Partnership Merger, to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.   5.7
TRANSFER AND GAINS TAXES. Each party shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales,
use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(together with any related interests, penalties or additions to tax,
"Transfer and Gains Taxes"). From and after the Effective Time, Mack-Cali
shall pay or cause Mack-Cali Partnership, as appropriate, to pay or cause to
be paid, without deduction or withholding from any amounts payable to the
holders of Mack-Cali Common Shares and Mack-Cali Series A Preferred Shares,
or New Mack-Cali Units, as applicable, all Transfer and Gains Taxes (which
term shall not in any event be construed to include for these purposes any
tax imposed under the Code).   5.8 BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE
ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) BENEFIT PLANS. After the Effective Time, all employees
of Prentiss who are employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates
shall be entitled to receive benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the
Surviving Corporation, with respect to each employee benefit plan,
arrangement or policy sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time. With respect to each such employee benefit plan,
service with Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary (as applicable) and the
predecessor of any of them shall be included for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including
receiving credit under any Mack-Cali Employee Plans or other plans maintained
by the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Times for any deductibles
and out-of-pocket expenses incurred to the Effective Times. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Mack-Cali shall specifically assume Prentiss\' obligations
under the change of control arrangements and Prentiss employee severance
policies listed or described on Schedule 2.15 of the Prentiss Disclosure
Letter and honor all obligations arising thereunder.   (b) STOCK OPTION AND
RESTRICTED STOCK PLANS. As of the Effective Time, the stock option plans and
the restricted stock plan of Prentiss shall be discontinued.   (c) PRENTISS
SHARE OPTIONS. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Prentiss Share
Option shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without further action of
Prentiss, Mack-Cali or the holder of such Prentiss Share Option, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, become immediately vested and exercisable and
be assumed by Mack-Cali, and be deemed to constitute an option to acquire
on    57   substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Prentiss Share Option (except that each such Prentiss
Share Option shall remain exercisable until the expiration of its term and
will not terminate as a result of termination of employment or for any other
reason), the same number of Mack-Cali Common Shares as the holder of such
Prentiss Share Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the
Merger had such holder exercised such Prentiss Share Option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time at an exercise price per share equal
to the aggregate exercise price for the Prentiss Common Shares subject to
such Prentiss Share Option divided by the number of full Mack-Cali Common
Shares deemed to be purchasable pursuant to such Prentiss Share Option;
provided, however, that the number of Mack-Cali Common Shares that may be
purchased upon exercise of such Prentiss Share Option shall not include any
fractional share; further provided, that such fractional share shall
be deemed exercised on the Effective Time and as soon as practicable
thereafter a cash payment shall be made for such fractional share in an
amount equal to the value of such fractional share calculated in accordance
with and in the manner provided for calculations as to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares as part of the Merger Consideration under Section 1.10 less
the exercise of such fractional share. Prior to, or simultaneously with, the
Effective Time, Mack-Cali shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause to become effective under the Securities Act, a Registration Statement
on Form S-8 in compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated under
the Securities Act covering that number of Mack-Cali Common Shares that would
become issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Prentiss Share Options.
Mack-Cali shall take all action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Mack-Cali Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of
all outstanding Prentiss Shares Options assumed in accordance with this
Section 5.8(c). Notwithstanding the above, the vesting of the Prentiss Share
Option granted to Mr. Michael V. Prentiss and Thomas F. August pursuant
to paragraph 5.8(f) below shall not vest at the Effective Time.   (d)
RESTRICTED STOCK. As of the Effective Time, all unvested shares of restricted
stock of Prentiss ("Prentiss Restricted Shares") (i.e. the
Prentiss Restricted Shares set forth in Schedule 5.8(d) of the Prentiss
Disclosure Letter, plus the Prentiss Restricted Shares granted pursuant to
paragraph 5.8(g) hereof) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without
further action of Prentiss, Mack-Cali or the holder of such Prentiss
Restricted Shares, become immediately vested in full and be exchanged for the
same number of Mack-Cali Common Shares as the holder of such Prentiss
Restricted Shares would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
had such Prentiss Restricted Shares vested in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that the number of Mack-Cali Common Shares
into which such Prentiss Restricted Shares were converted shall not include
any fractional share and, as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, a cash payment shall be made for such fractional share calculated in
accordance with and in the manner provided for calculations as to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares as part of the Merger Consideration under Section
1.10. Prior to, or simultaneously with, the Effective Time, Mack-Cali shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective under
the Securities Act, a Registration Statement on Form S-8 in compliance with
the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act covering that
number of Mack-Cali Restricted Common Shares issued in exchange for the
outstanding Prentiss Restricted Shares.   (e) WITHHOLDING. To the extent
required by applicable law, Prentiss shall require each employee who
exercises a Prentiss Share Option or who receives Prentiss Common Shares
pursuant to any existing commitment to pay to Prentiss in cash or Prentiss
Common Shares an amount sufficient to satisfy in full Prentiss\' obligation
to withhold Taxes incurred by reason of such exercise or issuance.   
58    (f) MACK-CALI OPTIONS. Within thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, Prentiss shall deliver to Mack-Cali a schedule (the "Share
Option Schedule") setting forth the number of Prentiss Share Options proposed
to be issued to named Prentiss Employees excluding Mr. Michael V. Prentiss
and Thomas F. August ("Eligible Share Grantees"); provided that the aggregate
amount of such Prentiss Share Options set forth in such schedule shall not
exceed 300,000. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Prentiss may issue
to those Eligible Share Grantees who are not Continuing Grantees (as defined
below) the number of Prentiss Share Options proposed to be issued to such
Eligible Share Grantee in the Share Option Schedule pursuant a Prentiss long
term incentive plan with a per share exercise price not less than the closing
price of Prentiss Common Shares on the day immediately preceding the date of
grant. In addition, at any time prior to the Closing Date, Prentiss may issue
to each of Mr. Michael V. Prentiss and Thomas F. August 150,000 Prentiss
Share Options pursuant to a Prentiss long term incentive plan (the "Executive
Options"); provided, that each of Mr. Michael V. Prentiss and Thomas F.
August shall agree his Executive Options shall, notwithstanding any provision
of the Prentiss long term incentive plan pursuant to which they were granted
to the contrary, not vest on the Closing Date but shall instead vest in equal
installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing
Date. The Executive Options shall be issued at a per share exercise price
equal to $26.4375. Any Prentiss Share Option issued pursuant to this
paragraph 5.8(f) shall be subject to paragraph 5.8(c). In addition, promptly
following the Effective Time, Mack-Cali shall issue pursuant to a Mack-Cali
long term incentive plan Mack-Cali Options with an exercise price equal to
the average closing price of the Mack-Cali Common Shares on the NYSE for the
five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (the "Exercise
Price") and vesting in three equal installments on the first, second and
third anniversaries of the Effective Time to each Eligible Share Grantee who
is a Continuing Grantee the same number of Mack-Cali Common Shares as
proposed to be issued to such individual in the Share Option Schedule.   (g)
DELAYED RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS. Within thirty (30) days prior to the Closing
Date, Prentiss shall deliver to Mack-Cali a schedule (the "Restricted Share
Schedule") setting forth the number of Prentiss Restricted Shares proposed to
be issued to named Prentiss Employees excluding Mr. Michael V. Prentiss and
Thomas A. August ("Eligible Restricted Share Grantees"); provided that the
aggregate amount of such Prentiss Restricted Shares set forth in such
schedule shall not exceed 100,000. Immediately prior to the Closing Date,
Prentiss may issue to those Eligible Restricted Share Grantees who are
not Continuing Grantees pursuant to a Prentiss long term incentive plan the
number of Prentiss Restricted Shares proposed to be issued to such Eligible
Restricted Share Grantee in the Restricted Share Schedule. Any Prentiss
Restricted Shares issued pursuant to this paragraph 5.8(g) shall be subject
to paragraph 5.8 (d). In addition, promptly following the Effective Time,
Mack-Cali shall issue pursuant to a Mack-Cali long term incentive plan
restricted shares of Mack-Cali ("Mack-Cali Restricted Shares") vesting in
equal installments on the third anniversary of the Effective Time to each
Eligible Restricted Share Grantee who is a Continuing Grantee in an amount
equal to the same number of Mack-Cali Common Shares as proposed to be issued
to such Continuing Grantee in the Restricted Share Schedule.   (h)
EMPLOYMENT OF PRENTISS EMPLOYEES. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Closing Date, Mack-Cali shall provide Prentiss with a list of those Eligible
Share Grantees and Eligible Restricted Share Grantees who will continue to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates as of and after the
Effective Time (the "Continuing Grantees"). On and after the Effective Times,
each Continuing Grantee shall initially hold the same title and position such
Continuing Grantee held while employed by Prentiss or its
Affiliates. Immediately after the Effective Times, all Prentiss Employees who
continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates,
excluding those Prentiss    59   Employees who have employment
agreements as set forth on Schedule 2.13(a) to the Disclosure Letter, shall
be employees "at-will," without guaranteed employment for any specified
period of time. An employment agreement shall simultaneously herewith be
entered into by and between Mack-Cali and Mr. Michael V. Prentiss (the
"Employment Agreement"). The Employment Agreement will provide for a five (5)
year term. It shall provide those benefits listed on Schedule 5.8(h) of the
Prentiss Disclosure Letter which would have been provided to Michael V.
Prentiss had he terminated his employment under the amended and restated
employment agreement dated as of May 10, 2000 between Mr. Michael V. Prentiss
and Prentiss (the "obligation for benefits provided under the Old
Agreement"). The obligation for benefits provided under the Old Agreement
shall be reflected as an accrued liability in the Prentiss balance sheet and
shall on the Closing Date be assumed by Mack-Cali. Any obligations to make
any payments to employees as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Mergers shall be either paid by Prentiss and
reflected accordingly in their Financial Statements or to the extent
such payments are not paid by Prentiss and are to be assumed and paid
by Mack-Cali, such payments shall be reflected as an accrued liability in
the Prentiss balance sheet and shall on the Closing Date be assumed by Mack-
Cali.   5.9 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership (collectively, the "Indemnifying
Parties") shall provide exculpation and indemnification, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, for each person who is now or has been at
anytime prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
an officer, trustee or director of Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") which is the same as the exculpation and
indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by Prentiss and the
Prentiss Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time in
its declaration of trust, charter, Bylaws or in its partnership, operating
or similar agreement, as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however,
that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on or prior to the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, all transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (b) In addition to the rights provided in Section
5.9(a) above, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including without limitation, any action by or on behalf of any or all
security holders of Prentiss or Mack-Cali, or any Prentiss Subsidiary or
Mack-Cali Subsidiary, or by or in the right of Prentiss or Mack-Cali, or any
Prentiss Subsidiary or Mack-Cali Subsidiary, or any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an
officer, employee, trustee or director of Prentiss or any of the Prentiss
Subsidiaries or any action or omission by such person in his capacity as a
director or trustee, or (ii) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, Mack-Cali, Prentiss and the Indemnified Parties, hereby
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense
of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. The Indemnified
Parties shall have the right to select counsel, subject to the consent of the
Indemnifying Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). After the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent
permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses), costs, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in accordance herewith in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in each case to the maximum
extent to which a corporation is permitted    60   under the MGCL. In
addition, after the Effective Time, in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Indemnifying
Parties shall promptly pay and advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred
by each Indemnified Person as they become due and payable in advance of the
final disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party to repay any expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (ii) shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In the event of a final and
non-appealable determination by a court that any payment of expenses is
prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnified Person shall promptly refund to
the Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced
pursuant hereto. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Parties of such
claim and the relevant facts and circumstances with respect thereto;
provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect
the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties hereunder except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability
to defend such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and
provided, further, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to
provide any notification pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) prior to the
Effective Time.   If any action is brought against any of the Indemnified
Parties and such Indemnified Parties notify the Indemnifying Parties of its
commencement, the Indemnifying Parties will assume the defense of such
action, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and will pay the costs and
expenses of the defense; provided however that the Indemnifying Parties will
be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they elect by
delivering written notice to such Indemnified Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnified
Parties, to assume the defense of the action and after such notice, the
Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to the Indemnified Parties for any
legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the
reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense. The Indemnifying Parties shall not
settle any such action without the consent of the Indemnified Parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being agreed that
it shall not be deemed unreasonable to withhold consent if the
settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing or payment of any money by or
on the part of the Indemnifying Parties or any decree or restriction in the
Indemnified Parties or their officers, directors or trustees; provided,
further, that no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such action shall,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Parties, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Parties of a release of all liability with respect to such
action. The Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ their own
counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such
counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Parties unless (i) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnified Parties has been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (ii) the Indemnified Parties have
reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be
legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Parties, (iii) a conflict or potential
conflict exists (based on advice of    61   counsel) between the
Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties (in which case the
Indemnifying Parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such
action on behalf of the Indemnified Parties) or (iv) the Indemnifying Parties
have not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within
a reasonable time after receiving notice thereof in each of which cases the
reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Parties.   (d) At or prior to the Effective
Time, Mack-Cali shall purchase directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
"tail" policy coverage for Prentiss\' trustees and officers for a period of
six years, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain policies
which will provide the trustees and officers with coverage on substantially
similar terms as (but which shall be no less favorable than those) currently
provided by Prentiss to such trustees and officers for claims based on
activity prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that Mack-Cali shall
have no obligation to pay aggregate premiums for such coverage in excess of
$500,000.   (e) This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of,
and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their
successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Mack-Cali. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 and Mack-Cali
acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable
harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants
and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and
specific performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this
Section.   (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of
its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case
the successors and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for
the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director,
trustee and officer covered hereby.   5.10 DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND
DISTRIBUTIONS. Subject to Section 1.16(d) hereof, from and after the date of
this Agreement, neither Prentiss nor Mack-Cali shall make any dividend or
distribution to its shareholders without the prior written consent of the
other party; provided, however, the written consent of the other party shall
not be required for the authorization and payment of quarterly distributions
with respect to the Prentiss Common Shares, Prentiss Series A Preferred
Shares or Mack-Cali Common Shares for the dividend for the second quarter of
2000, and for each quarterly dividend thereafter in an amount up to the
dividend per share paid by it for the first quarter of 2000; provided,
however, the record date for each distribution with respect to the Prentiss
Common Shares and Prentiss Series A Preferred Shares shall be the same date
as the record date for the quarterly distribution for the Mack-Cali
Common Shares as agreed by the parties from time to time. Subject to Section
1.16(d) hereof, from and after the date of this Agreement, Prentiss
Partnership shall not make any distribution to the holders of Prentiss Common
Units except a distribution per Prentiss Common Unit in the same amount as a
dividend per Prentiss Common Share permitted pursuant to this Section 5.10,
with the same record and payment dates as such dividend on the Prentiss
Common Shares, and shall not make any distribution to the holders of Prentiss
Series B Preferred Units or Prentiss Series C Preferred Units except a
distribution per such Prentiss Preferred Unit as called for by their
respective Certificates of Designation. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Mack-Cali Partnership shall not make any    
62   distribution to the holders of Mack-Cali Common Units except a
distribution per Mack-Cali Common Unit in the same amount as a dividend per
Mack-Cali Common Share permitted pursuant to this Section 5.10, with the same
record and payment dates as such dividend on the Mack-Cali Common Shares, and
shall not make any distribution to the holders of Mack-Cali Series A
Preferred Units or Mack-Cali Series B Preferred Units except a distribution
per such Mack-Cali Preferred Unit as called for by their respective
Certificates of Designation.   The foregoing restrictions shall not apply,
however, to the extent a distribution by Prentiss or Mack-Cali is necessary
for Prentiss or Mack-Cali, as applicable, to maintain REIT status.   5.11
TRANSFER OF NON-CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY VOTING SHARES. At the Closing and
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, each of the holders of voting
capital stock of the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary (other than Prentiss
Partnership, to the extent it owns any such voting capital stock)
shall transfer to the individual or individuals designated by Mack-Cali
Services, Inc., by written notice delivered to them prior to the Closing, all
of the shares of each such Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary owned by
them, constituting all the outstanding shares of such companies which are not
owned by Prentiss Partnership, for an aggregate consideration in an amount
equal to the purchase price set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Mack-
Cali shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the individual or
individuals designated by Mack-Cali Services, Inc. as party or parties to the
Stock Purchase Agreement to perform his or their obligations thereunder.  
5.12 ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING PRENTISS TAX PROTECTION AGREEMENTS. Mack-Cali and
Mack-Cali Partnership shall assume the obligations of Prentiss, Prentiss
Partnership or the applicable Prentiss Subsidiary, as the case may be, under
the Prentiss Tax Protection Agreements described in Schedule 2.18(j) to the
Prentiss Disclosure Letter. Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership shall
be obligated to (i) provide the beneficiaries of the Prentiss Tax
Protection Agreements identical lock-out rights as such beneficiaries were
entitled under the Prentiss Tax Protection Agreements and (ii) make available
to the beneficiaries of the Prentiss Tax Protection Agreements guarantees
or indemnities of the bottom portion (i.e. the least risky portion) of Mack-
Cali or Mack-Cali Partnership debt pari passu with other partners of Mack-
Cali Partnership who are entitled to such guarantees or indemnities.   5.13

Mack-Cali shall assume by appropriate instrument the Registration Rights
Agreements described on Schedule 5.13 to the Prentiss Disclosure Letter.  
5.14 REDEMPTION OF RIGHTS PLAN. On the business day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, Prentiss shall redeem all of the then outstanding rights to
purchase Series B Junior Participating Preferred Shares of Prentiss granted
in connection with the Rights Agreement between Prentiss and First Chicago
Trust Company of New York, dated as of February 6, 1998, pursuant to
the terms thereof.   5.15 SECTION 16(B) MATTERS. Each of Prentiss and Mack-
Cali shall use its commercially reasonable efforts and take such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, having its

the Prentiss Partner Approvals shall not have been obtained as contemplated
by Section 5.1;   (g) by either Prentiss or Mack-Cali (unless Mack-Cali or

contemplated by Section 5.1 or if the Mack-Cali Partner Approvals shall not

Acquisition Proposal; provided that, in each case, Prentiss shall
have complied with the terms of Section 4.3 and, prior to terminating
pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), has paid to Mack-Cali the Break-Up Fee (as

(i) by Mack-Cali, if (i) the Board of Trustees of Prentiss shall have failed

publicly not to recommend or to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any
manner adverse to Mack-Cali its approval or recommendation of either of
the Mergers or this Agreement or approved or recommended any Superior

CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES. If this Agreement shall be terminated (i) pursuant
to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(h) or 7.1(i), then Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership
thereupon shall pay to Mack-Cali Partnership a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee
(as defined below), and (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then Prentiss and
Prentiss Partnership shall pay to Mack-Cali Partnership (provided that
Prentiss was not then entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(c) at the time of such termination) an amount equal to the
Break-Up Expenses (as defined below). If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or 7.1(g), then Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali
Partnership shall pay Prentiss Partnership (provided that Mack-Cali was not
then entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the
time of such termination) an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee. If this
Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (if primarily
resulting from any action or inaction of Prentiss, Prentiss Partnership or
any Prentiss Subsidiary or the Prentiss Non-controlled Subsidiary), 7.1(e) or
7.1(f) and prior to the time of such termination a Prentiss Acquisition
Proposal has been received by Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary, and either
prior to the termination of this Agreement or within twelve (12) months
thereafter, Prentiss or any Prentiss Subsidiary enters into any written
Prentiss Acquisition Proposal which is subsequently consummated (whether or
not any such Prentiss Acquisition    68   Proposal is the same Prentiss
Acquisition Proposal which had been received at the time of the termination
of this Agreement), then Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership shall pay the
Break-Up Fee to Mack-Cali Partnership.   The payment of the Break-Up Fee
shall be compensation for the loss suffered by Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali
Partnership or Prentiss or Prentiss Partnership (as applicable) as a result
of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated (including, without
limitation, opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to
avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances. The
Break-Up Fee shall be paid by Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership to Mack-Cali
Partnership or Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership to Prentiss Partnership
(as applicable), or the Break-Up Expenses shall be paid by Prentiss and
Prentiss Partnership to Mack-Cali Partnership or Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali
Partnership to Prentiss Partnership (as applicable), in immediately available
funds within two (2) business days after the date the event giving rise to
the obligation to make such payment occurred (except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.1(h) or 7.1(i)). Prentiss acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are integral parts of this
Agreement; accordingly, if Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership fail to promptly
pay the Break-Up Fee or Break-Up Expenses due pursuant to this Section 7.2
and, in order to obtain payment, Mack-Cali commences a suit which results in
a judgment against Prentiss or Prentiss Partnership for any amounts owed
pursuant to this Section 7.2, Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership shall pay to
Mack-Cali its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount owed at the
rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made plus 300 basis points.   As used in this
Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$30,000,000 less Break-Up Expenses paid or payable under this Section 7.2
(the "Base Amount") and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss Partnership (as applicable) without
causing Mack-Cali or Prentiss (as applicable) to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c) (3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying
Income"), as determined by independent accountants to Mack-Cali, and (B) in
the event Mack-Cali or Prentiss (as applicable) receives a letter from
outside counsel (the "Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion") indicating that Mack-Cali or
Prentiss (as applicable) has received a ruling from the IRS holding that
Mack-Cali Partnership\'s or Prentiss Partnership\'s (as applicable) receipt
of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income of Mack-Cali or Prentiss (as applicable) within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT
Requirements") or that the receipt by Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss
Partnership (as applicable) of the remaining balance of the Base Amount
following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less the amount paid
under clause (A) above. Prentiss\' and Prentiss Partnership\'s or Mack-Cali
or Mack-Cali Partnership\'s (as applicable) obligation to pay any unpaid
portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three years from the date of this
Agreement. In the event that Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss
Partnership (as applicable) is not able to receive the full Base Amount,
Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership or Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership (as
applicable) shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any
portion thereof to Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss Partnership (as
applicable) unless and until Mack-Cali or Prentiss (as applicable) receives
either one of the following: (i) a letter from Mack-Cali\'s or Prentiss\'(as
applicable) independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss Partnership (as
applicable) without causing Mack-Cali or Prentiss (as applicable) to fail to
meet the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either
of     69   which events Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership shall pay to
Mack-Cali Partnership or Mack-Cali and Mack-Cali Partnership shall pay to
Prentiss Partnership the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or the maximum
amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above.   The "Break-Up
Expenses" payable to Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss Partnership, as the
case may be (the "Recipient"), shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$5,000,000, (ii) the Recipient\'s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, all attorneys\', accountants\' and investment
bankers\' fees and expenses) or (iii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that
can be paid to the Recipient without causing Mack-Cali or Prentiss, as the
case may be, to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to
Mack-Cali or Prentiss, as the case may be, and (B) in the event Mack-Cali or
Prentiss, as the case may be, receives a letter from outside counsel (a
"Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion") indicating that it has received a ruling from
the IRS holding that the Recipient\'s receipt of the Break-Up Expenses would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of
Mack-Cali or Prentiss, as the case may be, within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements or that receipt by the Recipient of the remaining balance of the
Break-Up Expenses following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would
not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Break-Up Expenses
less the amount paid under clause (A) above. The obligation of Mack-Cali and
Mack-Cali Partnership or Prentiss and Prentiss Partnership, as applicable
("Payor"), to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses shall terminate
three years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that the Recipient
is not able to receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor shall place the
unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the
Recipient unless and until the Payor receives either one of the following:
(i) a letter from the independent accountants of Mack-Cali or Prentiss, as
the case may be, indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time
to the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or
(ii) a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion, in either of which events the Payor
shall pay to the Recipient the lesser of the unpaid Break-Up Expenses or the
maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above.   7.3 EFFECT
OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Prentiss or Mack-Cali as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of Mack-Cali, Mack-Cali Partnership, Prentiss or Prentiss
Partnership, other than the last sentence of Section 5.2, Section 7.2, this
Section 7.3 and Article 8, and except to the extent that such
termination results from a willful breach by any party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.   7.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of the Board of Directors of Mack-Cali and the Board of
Trustees of Prentiss at any time before or after any Shareholder Approvals or
Partner Approvals are obtained and prior to the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Department; provided, however, that, after the Shareholder
Approvals and Partner Approvals are obtained, no such amendment, modification
or supplement shall be made which by law requires the further approval of
shareholders without obtaining such further approval. The parties agree to
amend this Agreement in the manner provided in the immediately preceding
sentence to the extent required to (a) continue the status of each party as a
REIT or (b) preserve the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368 of the Code.    70    7.5 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to

Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.   ARTICLE 8  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 NONSURVIVAL

in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
confirming the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive

exchange shall be paid an amount in cash  (without interest), rounded to the
nearest cent, determined  by multiplying (i) the average closing price of one
share of  Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the five  trading
days immediately preceding the Closing Date (as  defined in the Merger
Agreement) by (ii) the fractional  amount of the unit which such holder would
otherwise be  entitled to receive under this Article EIGHTH (such cash 
payments, together with the Mack-Cali Common Units and New  Mack-Cali
Preferred Units to be issued pursuant to this  Article EIGHTH, hereinafter
sometimes collectively referred  to as, the "Merger Consideration").   (d)

Exchange Agent and shall be in such a  form and have such provisions as Mack-
Cali may reasonably  specify); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting

transfer and the person or entity requesting such payment  either shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by  reason of such payment being made to
a person or entity other  than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish  to the satisfaction of Mack-Cali that such taxes have been  paid

EIGHTH, each Certificate shall be deemed at  any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right  to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration,  without interest, into which the Mack-Cali Common Units or 
New Mack-Cali Preferred Units, as applicable, theretofore  evidenced by such
Certificate shall have been converted into  the right to receive pursuant to
Article EIGHTH, and any  dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is  entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.16(d) of the 
Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the  Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of any Certificate or  any cash payable

Consideration, or dividends or other distributions  with respect to Mack-Cali
Common Units or New Mack-Cali  Preferred Units with a record date after the
Effective Time,  shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate  with respect to Prentiss Common Units or Prentiss Preferred 
Units represented thereby, in each case until after the  surrender of such
certificate in accordance with this Article  EIGHTH and Section 1.16 of the
Merger Agreement.   (f) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of  Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article  EIGHTH shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction  of all rights pertaining to
Prentiss Common Units or Prentiss  Preferred Units, as applicable,
theretofore represented by  such Certificates; provided, however, that
Prentiss shall  transfer to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay any 
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date  prior to the
Effective Time which may have been declared or  made by Prentiss on the
Prentiss Common Units or Prentiss  Preferred Units, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms  of the Merger Agreement or prior to the date of
the Merger  Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and 
have not been paid prior to such surrender, and there shall  be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer  books of Prentiss of the
Prentiss Common Units or Prentiss  Preferred Units which were outstanding
immediately prior to  the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, 
Certificates are presented to Mack-Cali for any reason, they  shall be
canceled and exchanged in accordance with this  Article EIGHTH and Section
1.16 of the Merger Agreement.   (g) None of Prentiss, Mack-Cali or the
Exchange Agent shall be  liable to any person or entity in respect of any
Merger  Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any 
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any  portion of the
Merger Consideration delivered to the Paying  Agent pursuant to this Article
EIGHTH that remains unclaimed  for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be  redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Mack-Cali, upon demand  and
any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore  complied with this
Article EIGHTH shall thereafter look only  to Mack-Cali for delivery of the
Merger Consideration and any  unpaid dividends, subject to applicable escheat
and other  similar laws.   (h) Mack-Cali Units: Upon the Effective Time,
