Agreement.

 



3 2.4 _No Litigation_. None of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Project

proceeding or governmental investigation (other than for such matters as
relate to Logans Gap Holdco or its Subsidiaries or the Wind Project, which,
for the avoidance of doubt, are provided for in _Section 2.12_) against

delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

more Seller Affiliates as identified in _Part I_ of  _Appendix C_ , of record

interests or voting securities of Logans Gap B Member LLC or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any obligations of Logans Gap B Member LLC or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing.

2.7  _Solvency_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement

(d) has taken any action to approve any of the foregoing.

2.8 _Compliance with Law_. To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no
actual violation by Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor of or
failure of Seller, any Subsidiary Transferor or Guarantor to comply with any
Governmental Rule that is applicable to it, or allegation by any Governmental
Authority of such a violation, that would reasonably be expected to be
material and relates to the Wind Project or would otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.9 _Taxes_. Each of the representations by the Class B Member (as defined in
the ECCA) pursuant to Section 3.5 of the ECCA (except for the representations
or warranties contained in clauses (e), (o), (r) and (t) of Section 3.5 of the
ECCA), is true and correct at and as of the date hereof and the Closing Date
as if made at and as of such dates (other than any representations or
warranties that are made as of a specific date, which shall be true and
correct as of such date). For each of the representations by the Class B
Member (as defined in the ECCA) pursuant to Section 3.5 of the ECCA that is
made as of the Funding Date, no facts or circumstances as of the date hereof
or the Closing Date would reasonably be expected to preclude such
representation from being true and correct as of the Funding Date. For
purposes of this _Section 2.9_ , each reference in Section 3.5 of the ECCA to
"the Company" (other than references to "the Company" in 3.5(q) of the ECCA)
shall be treated as if it were a reference to Logans Gap Holdco and Logans
Gap B Member LLC.

2.10 _Unregistered Securities_. It is not necessary in connection with the
sale of the Acquired Interests, under the circumstances contemplated by this
Agreement, to register such Acquired Interests under the Securities Act of
1933 (the " _Securities Act_ ") or under any other applicable securities laws.

has any liability or obligation for any fees or commissions to any broker,
finder or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

2.12 _Matters Relating to the Acquired Interests, the Project Company and the
Wind Project_. A true, complete and correct list of all Material Contracts as
of the date hereof is set forth on _Parts I_, _III_ , _IV_ and _V_ of
_Appendix D_. All representations and warranties set forth in _Schedule 2.12_
(disregarding all qualifications set forth therein as to materiality, material
adverse effect or other similar qualifications) are true and correct at and as
of the date hereof and the Closing Date as if made at and as of such dates
(other than any representations or warranties that are made as of a specific
date, which shall be true and correct as of such date), with only such
exceptions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Impact.

6 3.5 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.5_ , no

under this _Article 6_ (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not be liable
under this _Article 6_ to an Indemnified Party for any Claim for breach of any
representation or warranty unless and until the aggregate amount of all Claims

foregoing limitation shall not apply in the case of actual fraud by the

If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person responsible for any Losses subsequent to an

result in a duplicative recovery, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by

must give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Third Party Claim (a "
_Third Party Claim Notice_ ") within twenty (20) Business Days after it
becomes aware of the existence of the Third Party Claim and that it may
constitute a Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Partys failure to give a
Third Party Claim Notice in compliance with this _Section 6.4(a)_ of any
Third Party Claim which may give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability which it may have to
the Indemnified Party unless, and solely to the extent that, the failure to
give such notice materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
__

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim with the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, in
each case at the Indemnifying Partys own cost and expense ( _provided_ that
prior to assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must
acknowledge its indemnity obligations under this _Article 6_ ), and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with separate counsel
selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof; _provided_ that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) incurred by the
Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) if such Third Party Claim would
reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the business,
reputation or future prospects of any Indemnified Party or (iii) if
representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the
same counsel would create a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party
(i) fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election
to defend or fails to acknowledge its indemnity obligations under this
_Article 6_ as provided in this Agreement, (ii) elects not to defend (or
compromise at its sole cost and expense) such Third Party Claim, (iii) has
elected to defend such Third Party Claim but fails to promptly and diligently
pursue the defense such Third Party Claim, (iv) otherwise breaches any of its
obligations under this _Article 6_ or (v) as set forth on _Schedule 6.4(b)_
hereto, or if the Third Party Claim is reasonably expected by the Indemnified
Party to result in a payment obligation on the Indemnified Party in an amount
that exceeds the maximum indemnification then available to the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article 6_ , then the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnified Party may (by written notice to the Indemnifying
Party) assume control of such defense (in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party)
and/or compromise such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all

 



15  Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. The
parties shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in this _Section
6.4(c)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim that (i) does
not (A) result in any liability or create any financial or other obligation on
the part of the Indemnified Party and (B) result in the loss of any right or
benefit on the part of any Indemnified Party, (ii) does not impose injunctive
or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, and (iii) provides,
in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
firm offer, then the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that
effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to
such firm offer within twenty (20) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within such twenty
(20) day period and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set
forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_, it may settle the
Third Party Claim; _provided_ that if the settlement is made without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Indemnifying Party shall have no
indemnity obligation pursuant to this _Article 6_ with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

6.5 _Mitigation; Treatment of Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses relating to a Claim for which indemnification is sought
under this _Article 6_.

(b) All indemnification payments under this _Article 6_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

6.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, and excluding liability for actual fraud, the
foregoing indemnification provisions of this _Article 6_ and the provisions of
_Section 7.16_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Purchaser
with respect to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other
agreement (other than any Purchase Price Adjustment set forth in _Part I_ of
_Appendix B_ ) or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, effective as of the Closing each of Purchaser and Seller covenants
to the other party that in respect of any matters under or contemplated in
this Agreement, it will not make any Claim whatsoever against any Affiliate
(other than Guarantor) of the other party or the directors, officers,
managers, shareholders, member, controlling persons, employees and agents of
any of the foregoing, in each case in their capacities as such, and its
rights in respect of any such Claim for breach of any provision of this
Agreement are limited solely to such rights as it may have against Seller (and
Guarantor) or Purchaser, as the case may be, under this Agreement.

Case Panel in accordance with Rule R-12. The Arbitrators, acting by majority

in any such Dispute by registered or certified mail addressed to the party
at the address set forth in _Part VII_ of _Appendix B_.

have the authority to award attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing
party or parties. In assessing the costs and expenses of the arbitration
and/or awarding attorneys fee and expenses, the Arbitrators shall consider
