(iv) $70,500,000.00, _less_ (v) $20,000,000.00, but only if, in accordance
with _Section 5.13_, Seller does not transfer the BLT Servicing Rights to the

only if Seller completes a sale or transfer of the BLT Servicing Rights
pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_ prior to the Closing. The Purchase Price shall

Section 2.05. _Closing Adjustment_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
calculate each of the component elements of Purchase Price as of the last day
of the most recently ended calendar month preceding the anticipated Closing

Accounting Principles. Such amounts shall be deemed to be an estimate by
Seller of the Purchase Price as of the Closing Date (" _Estimated Purchase
Price_ "). Seller shall, prior to delivery thereof, advise Acquiror of the
components of Purchase Price not less than ten Business Days prior to the
Closing (and shall deliver such supporting documentation to Acquiror as may be
reasonably requested by Acquiror and shall consider, in good faith, any
comments Acquiror may have on such components or supporting documentation
when preparing the Statement of Estimated Purchase Price). Seller shall
deliver to Acquiror not less than five Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, a written notice (the " _Closing Notice_ ") that includes the
following:

(a) a " _Statement of Estimated Purchase Price_ ", prepared in accordance with
the Transaction Accounting Principles and in the format set forth on _Exhibit
C_, setting forth the amount of the Estimated Purchase Price; and

(b) the account or accounts to which Acquiror shall pay the Estimated Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.07_.

Section 2.06. _Closing Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Acquiror:

 

(i) to the extent the Transferred Equity Interests are certificated,
certificates evidencing the Transferred Equity Interests, duly endorsed in
blank or accompanied by powers duly executed in blank or other duly executed
instruments of transfer as required in order to validly transfer title in and
to the Transferred Equity Interests, with any required stock transfer Tax
stamps properly affixed thereto, and to the extent such Transferred Equity
Interests are not certificated, other customary evidence of ownership;

(ii) duly executed counterparts to the Ancillary Agreements contemplated to be
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)_;

 



4 (iii) such assignment, assumption and other good and sufficient
instruments of conveyance, assignment and assumption, and such other
documents as the parties and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably
necessary for the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Company or to
vest in the Company (or one or more Designated Purchasers) all Sellers
right, title and interest in, to and under the BLT Servicing Rights, subject
(in the case of the BLT Servicing Rights) to the provisions of _Section
5.13_;

 

(iv) the resignations, as of the Closing, of each director of the Company,
together with releases in a form mutually acceptable to Seller and Acquiror;
and

(v) all documentation and agreements of transfer, assignment or assumption in
respect of the Restructuring Transactions.

Section 2.07. _Closing Deliveries by Acquiror_. At the Closing, Acquiror
shall deliver to Seller:

transfer in immediately available funds, to an account or accounts as directed
by Seller in the Closing Notice;

(ii) duly executed counterparts to the Ancillary Agreements contemplated to be
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.01(d)_; and

 

(iii) such assignment, assumption and other good and sufficient instruments of
conveyance, assignment and assumption, and such other documents as the
parties and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Company or to vest in the Company
(or one or more Designated Purchasers) all Sellers right, title and interest
in, to and under the BLT Servicing Rights, subject (in the case of the BLT
Servicing Rights) to the provisions of _Section 5.13_.

Section 2.08. _Post-Closing Statements_.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement (the " _Initial Closing Statement_ ") of the Purchase
Price as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Purchase Price_ "). The Initial
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Transaction
Accounting Principles, shall be in the format set forth on _Exhibit D_, and
shall include supporting schedules, working papers and all other relevant
details to enable a review by Seller thereof. In connection with Acquirors
preparation of the Initial Closing Statement, to the extent Acquiror does not
have all relevant information in its possession, Seller shall make available
all relevant information and the individuals in its employ and responsible
for and knowledgeable about the information to be used in the preparation of
the Initial Closing Statement in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries
of or requests for information by Acquiror. An example of an Initial Closing
Statement as of May 31, 2012 is set forth in _Section 2.08_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

 



5 (b) During the 60-day period immediately following Sellers receipt of the
Initial Closing Statement and the other information referred to in _Section
2.08(a)_ (the " _Review Period_ "), Seller and its Representatives will be
permitted to review Acquirors work papers, all books and records of
Acquiror and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company)
relevant to the review of the Initial Closing Statement, and Acquiror shall
make available the individuals in its employ as well as representatives of its
independent accountants responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation of the Initial Closing Statement, to
respond to the reasonable inquiries of Seller.

(c) Acquiror agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding, it will not take any
actions with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or procedures
on which the Initial Closing Statement is based or on which the Final Closing
Statement is to be based that would impede or delay the determination of the
amount of Purchase Price or the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement or
the Final Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods required
by this Agreement.

Section 2.09. _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

(a) Seller shall notify Acquiror in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_
") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if Seller disagrees with the
Initial Closing Statement or the Purchase Price set forth therein. The Notice
of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute, the amounts involved and Sellers determination of the Purchase
Price.

(b) During the 60-day period immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the " _Consultation Period_ "), Seller and Acquiror shall
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

(c) If at the end of the Consultation Period Seller and Acquiror have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Acquiror shall
each have the right to submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect
to the Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Closing
Statement marked to indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to
Ernst and Young (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Within 60 Business
Days after submission of any such matters to the Independent Accounting Firm,
the Independent Accounting Firm, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
shall make a final determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of
the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Initial Closing
Statement as to which Seller and Acquiror disagree as set out in the Notice of
Disagreement. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if
not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Acquiror, shall
not be in excess of the amount that results in higher Purchase Price, nor
less than the amount that results in lower Purchase Price, as advocated by
Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or Acquiror in the Initial Closing
Statement with respect to such disputed line item, respectively. During such
determination period, the Independent Accounting Firm also shall (x) prepare a
statement of Closing Purchase Price based upon all of the line items not
disputed by the parties and the line items determined by the Independent

Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery by Seller of the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated by, and the performance by Seller of its obligations under, the
Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all requisite
action (corporate or otherwise) on the part of Seller. This Agreement and the
Tax Matters Agreement have been, and upon execution and delivery thereof, the
other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party will be, duly executed and
delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery

in good standing is not material to the Acquired Business (taken as a whole);
_provided_ that immediately prior to the Closing the Company shall be duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and be in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which it is required to be so in order to fully enforce
its rights under the Loan Documents for all Loans. True, complete and current

copy or summary description of each Seller Plan.

(b) None of the Company Plans is a defined benefit pension plan, retirement

Business Employees or individual service providers of employee-type services
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who reside or work outside of the
United States.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has now or at any time within the
previous six years contributed to, sponsored or maintained (i) any

(ii) a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the
Code or (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of

of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it
is so qualified, and each related trust that is intended to be exempt from
federal income Tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and no fact or event
has occurred since the date of such determination letter that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect such qualification or exemption, as the case
may be. 

 



18 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liability under or
arising out of Title IV of ERISA or _Section 302_ of ERISA and, to the

that has not been or will not be satisfied in full by Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries).

(f) Each Company Plan which Acquiror has agreed to assume or continue
pursuant to _Exhibit G_, is now and has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
Laws, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred and there exists
no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or
its Subsidiaries would reasonably expect to be subject to any material
Liabilities (other than for Liabilities with respect to routine benefit
claims) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company Plans or any
applicable Law.

 

(g) Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries, any Company Plan nor, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any trustee, administrator or other third-party
fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof, has engaged in any breach of
fiduciary responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) to which Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and which could subject the
Company or its Subsidiaries to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, which could reasonably be expected to
result in a Liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction that would
reasonably be expected to result in a civil penalty under Sections 409 or
502(i) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to any Liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or
Title I of ERISA with respect to any Company Plan. No "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the thirty day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations
to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Company Plan, nor
has any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred.

(h) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any interest or penalties
incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(i) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any
Company Plan or any trust related thereto which could reasonably be expected
to result in any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
audit or other proceeding by a Governmental Authority is pending, or to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to any Company Plan.

 



19 (j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any Business Employee to severance
pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation due to
any Business Employee, (iii) directly or indirectly cause the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material
benefits under any Company Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any material
liability under any Company Plan, (v) limit or restrict the right to merge,
materially amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any Company Plan on or
following the Closing, or (vi) result in a change in control to which Section
280G or 4999 of the Code would apply.

(k) Each Company Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material liabilities
to Acquiror, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than ordinary
administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event.

Section 3.16. _Employees and Labor Matters_.

 

(a) Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the

operational practices or determinations of the Seller relating to the
employment of labor).

(b) There is no claim that has been asserted or is now pending or, to the

consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Authority relating to
employees or employment practices, and there is no charge of discrimination in
employment or employment practices against the Company with respect to any

respect to payment of wages, salary or overtime pay that has been asserted or
is now pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened before any

or "non-exempt" employee under applicable Law (and Acquiror shall be
independently responsible for its conduct of the Business after the Closing
Date and shall not be entitled to rely on Sellers prior classification of the
Transferred Employees).

(e) Neither Seller, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates has
incurred any liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and

subject to the General Enforceability Exceptions..

(f) None of the Company, Seller and any Affiliate of Seller is in default

Obligors under the Loan Documents relating to each Loan.

 

(h) Each Loan was originated by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (each, a "
_Seller Related Party_ ") or, to Sellers Knowledge, by a prior un-Affiliated
other originator, in accordance with all applicable Laws in all material
respects, and the underlying Loan or acquisition (as applicable) by a Seller
Related Party was approved by such Seller Related Party in accordance with
its then applicable approval process.

(i) Except as evidenced by the Loan Documents, none of the
material provisions of the Loan Documents have been waived, modified or
altered in any respect, or subordinated in any respect, by Seller or any of
its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, the originator of the Loan,
other than as a result of any utility easements, reciprocal easements or
other customary easements that, in each case, would not adversely affect the
Loan value.

(j) The information set forth in the Loan Schedule is true and correct as of
the date hereof with respect to the matters set forth therein.

 

(k) Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller (including the Company) has,
with respect to any Loan, advanced any funds to, or solicited any funds or
applied any funds from, a party other than the Obligor with respect to such
Loan.

(l) There are no escrow or reserves accounts related to Taxes, insurance or
other charges, for such Loan.

(m) As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Seller, none of the Loan
Collateral is subject to any expropriation or condemnation proceedings
instituted by any applicable Governmental Authority that would materially and
adversely affect the value of such Loan Collateral. 

(n) Subject to the General Enforceability Exceptions: The Mortgage is a valid,
subsisting and enforceable first lien mortgage on the Mortgaged Property,
including all improvements on the Mortgaged Property and all additions,
alterations and replacements made at any time with respect to the foregoing
and (if applicable) provides for an assignment of rents, income and profits
from the Mortgaged Property and creates a valid and enforceable lien and
security interest of the same priority as the lien of the Mortgage. Such lien
is subject only to: (i) the lien of real property taxes and assessments not
yet due and payable; (ii) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of
way, easements and other matters of the public record as of the date of
recording specifically referred to in lenders title insurance policy
delivered to the originator of the Loan, (iii) exceptions and exclusions
specifically referred to in such lenders title insurance policy, and (iv)
other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do not
materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be
provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, value or marketability of the
related Mortgaged Property.

 



23 (o) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) has
received any written notification from any Governmental Authority of any
alleged release of a hazardous substance from the Mortgaged Property in
violation of, or as would result in liability under, applicable Environmental
Law, other than a release (i) with respect to which (A) such Governmental
Authority has provided written notice to Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) has been remediated to the satisfaction of such
Governmental Authority or (B) the required remedial action is being
undertaken in the ordinary course by the related Obligor, or (ii) that would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect, in any material respect, the
use, value or marketability of the Loan Collateral.

 

(p) None of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company), and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, no other Person has engaged in fraud or has made
any material and intentional misrepresentation with respect to any Loan that
would adversely affect the rights of Acquiror in the Loan or Mortgaged
Property.

 

(q) All buildings and improvements upon the Mortgaged Property are required
under the terms of the related Loan Documents to be insured by a generally
acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage, and
such other hazards, to the extent required as of the date of origination by
the originator of such Loan, in an amount which is at least equal to the
lesser of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; and
(ii) the full replacement value of the Mortgaged Property. In the case of
flood insurance, all buildings and improvements upon the Mortgaged Property
are required under the terms of the related Loan Documents to be insured by a
generally acceptable insurer against loss by flood for the maximum amount of
insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.
If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and
flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Flood Insurance Administration
is required under the terms of the related Loan Documents to be in effect with
a generally acceptable insurance carrier. All such insurance policies contain
a standard mortgage clause naming the Seller, its successors and assigns as
mortgagee and all premiums thereon have been paid. The Mortgage obligates the
Obligor thereunder to maintain all such insurance at the Obligors cost and
expense, and on the Obligors failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the
Mortgage to maintain such insurance at Obligors cost and expense and to seek
reimbursement therefor from the Obligor. Each Loan File contains evidence of
insurance with respect to the Loan Collateral for the related Loan.

 

(r) Each Loan is covered by an ALTA lenders title insurance policy issued by
a nationally rated title insurance company qualified to do business in the
jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located, insuring the Seller or
originator, its successors and assigns, as to the first priority mortgage lien
of the Mortgage (subject to the exceptions referred to in Section
3.18(n)(i)-(iv) above) in the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan
(or any higher amount resulting from a modification thereof), after all
advances of principal and, if the Loan is an Adjustable Rate Loan , against
any loss by reason of the invalidity or unenforceability of the lien
resulting from the provisions of the Mortgage providing for adjustment in the
Mortgage Interest Rate. Where required by state Law or regulation, the Obligor
has been given the opportunity to choose the carrier of the required mortgage
title insurance. The Seller or originator, and its successors and assigns, is
insured under such lenders title insurance policy, and such lenders policy
is in full force and effect and will be in full force and effect upon the

 



24  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller
has not taken any action or omitted to take any action which would reasonably
be expected to limit the coverage of such lenders title insurance policy.
The lenders title policy is assignable to Acquiror without the consent the
insurer. All premiums on such title policy have been paid and no claims have
been made by Seller under such lenders title insurance policy.

(s) No Loan is cross-collateralized with a loan not being sold to Acquiror
under this Agreement. 

Section 3.19. _Loan Servicing_.

(a) Acquiror has been provided with true, complete and correct copies of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreements and any subservicing agreements entered into
in connection with the servicing of the Business Loan Trusts (the
"Subservicing Agreements" and together with the Pooling and Servicing

Agreements.

(b) None of the parties to the Servicing Agreements has provided notice that
it will terminate, modify or amend any of the Servicing Agreements.

not require any consents pursuant to the Servicing Agreements, other than the
receipt of the Rating Agency Confirmations and the BLT Trustee Consents, (x)
will not result in a breach or default under any of the Servicing Agreements,
(y) will not impair any of Sellers rights as "Master Servicer" under the
Servicing Agreements or (z) (assuming receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation
and the BLT Trustee Consents) otherwise cause any such Servicing Agreement to
cease to be legal, valid, binding or enforceable, or in full force and
effect, in accordance with its terms.

(d) (i) Seller and the Affiliates of Seller have complied with all
requirements of the Servicing Agreements and all applicable Laws relating to
the Servicing Agreements.

(ii) Seller or one if its Affiliate services and administers the Loans in a
manner consistent with servicing procedures utilized by Seller or such
Affiliate in servicing similar assets for their own account, and such
servicing practices comply with all applicable Laws in all material respects.

(e) No event has occurred, which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both would: ( _i_ ) constitute a material default or breach by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Depositor) under any
Servicing Agreement; ( _ii_ ) permit termination, modification or amendment of
any Servicing Agreement; ( _iii_ ) enable a third party to demand that that
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than a Depositor) either incur any
repurchase obligations pursuant to a Servicing Agreement or provide
indemnification for any amount of losses; or ( _iv_ ) impose on Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than Depositor) any sanctions or penalties in
respect of any Servicing Agreement.

 



25 (f) Section 3.19 of the Seller Disclosure Letter identifies each
subservicer, subcontractor or other agent (other than an Affiliate of Seller)
that has been engaged to perform any of the duties of the servicer under the
Servicing Agreements. Any such subservicer, subcontractor or other agent has
complied with all requirements of the Servicing Agreements and all applicable
Laws relating to the Servicing Agreements.

(g) Seller has the sole right to act as the Master Servicer under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreements.

(h) Seller or one of its Affiliates is entitled to receive all fees payable
to the "Master Servicer" that are due under the Servicing Agreements.

Section 3.20. _Brokers_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.20_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, no broker, finder or investment banker is or might be
entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Seller is solely
responsible for the investment advisory fees and expenses of the financial
advisors disclosed in  _Section 3.20_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

Section 3.21. _Books and Records_. The Books and Records, all of which will
have been delivered or made available to the Company upon completion of the
Restructuring Transactions, are complete in all material respects and have
been maintained in all material respects in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice.

Section 3.22. _Regulatory Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2010, Seller and its Affiliates have timely filed all
forms, reports, registration statements, schedules and other documents that
related to the Acquired Business and the Company, together with any amendments

any Governmental Authority (the " _Regulatory Documents_ "), and have timely
paid in full all material fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith.

 

(b) As of their respective dates, the Regulatory Documents of Seller and its
Affiliates that relate to the Acquired Business and the Company complied in
all material respects with applicable Laws as in effect at the time the
Regulatory Documents were filed.

OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES.

Section 4.01. _Incorporation and Authority of Acquiror_. Acquiror is (and as
of the Closing, each Designated Purchaser will be) a corporation or other
organization duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and, to the
extent legally applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization and has all necessary corporate power to
enter into the Transaction Agreements and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to carry out its obligations under, the Transaction
Agreements. The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by
Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser), the consummation by Acquiror
(and each Designated Purchaser) of the transactions contemplated by, and the
performance by Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser) of its obligations
under, the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser).
This Agreement has been (or, with respect to each Designated Purchaser, as of
the Closing, will be) and upon execution and delivery the other Transaction
Agreements will be, duly executed and delivered by Acquiror (and each
Designated Purchaser), and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Seller) this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery the
other Transaction Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser) enforceable against
Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser) in accordance with their terms,
subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting insured depository
institutions or creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability,
to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in an Action in equity or at law).

Section 4.02. _Qualification of Acquiror_. Acquiror has (and as of the
Closing, each Designated Purchaser will have) the corporate or other
appropriate power and authority to operate their respective businesses as now
conducted. Acquiror is (and as of the Closing, each Designated Purchaser will
be) duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other organization to do
business and, to the extent legally applicable, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its owned, operated or leased properties
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would
not impair or delay the ability of Acquiror or any such Designated Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated by, or perform its obligations
under, the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party. Except as disclosed
in Amendment No. 10 to the Form S-1 Registration Statement of Everbank
Financial Corporation filed on April 30, 2012, neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates are a party to any written order, decree, agreement or memorandum
of understanding with any U.S. federal or state bank Governmental Authority 

 



27  charged with the supervision or regulation of Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates, nor has Acquiror or any of its Affiliates been advised by any such
Governmental Authority that such Governmental Authority is contemplating
issuing or requesting any such order, decree, agreement or memorandum of
understanding.

 

Section 4.03. _No Conflict_. Provided that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in  _Section 4.04_ have been
obtained or taken, the execution, delivery and performance by Acquiror (or any
Designated Purchaser) of, and the consummation by Acquiror (or any Designated
Purchaser) of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements do
not and will not (i) violate or conflict with the certificate or articles of
incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents of Acquiror (or
any Designated Purchaser), (ii) conflict with or violate any Law or
Governmental Order applicable to Acquiror (or any Designated Purchaser) in any
material respect, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would
become a default) under, or give to any Person any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of its assets pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other material instrument to which Acquiror is a party or by which any of its
assets is bound or affected that would, in the case of this clause (iii),
impair or delay the ability of Acquiror or any such Designated Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, or perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party.

Section 4.04. _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery by Acquiror
(and each Designated Purchaser) of the Transaction Agreements do not, and the
performance by Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser) of, and the
consummation by Acquiror (and each Designated Purchaser) of the transactions
contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements will not, require any material
consent, approval, authorization or other action by, or any material filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except for the consents,
approvals, authorizations or other actions by, and filings with and
notifications to, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _Acquiror Governmental Consents_
") and state banking and commercial finance regulators.

Section 4.05. _Absence of Restraints; Compliance with Laws_. To the knowledge
of Acquiror, as of the date hereof there exist no facts or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of
Acquiror (or any Designated Purchaser) to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, or to perform its obligations under, the Transaction
Agreements.

 

(a) Neither Acquiror nor any Designated Purchaser is (i) in violation of any
Laws or Governmental Orders applicable to it or by which any of its material
assets is bound or affected, or (ii) as of the date hereof, aware of any
pending or threatened disputes or controversies between Acquiror or any
Designated Purchaser and any Governmental Authority, except for violations
disputes, or controversies the existence of which would not reasonably be
likely to materially impair or delay the ability of Acquiror or any Designated
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by, or to perform
its obligations under, the Transaction Agreements.

 



28 (b) As of the date hereof, neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates have
received any indication from any federal or state Governmental Authority that
such Governmental Authority would oppose or refuse to grant an Acquiror
Governmental Consent.

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror has no reason to believe that it will be
required to divest assets or any business or line of business as a condition
to the receipt of any Acquiror Governmental Consent.

Section 4.06. _Securities Matters_. The Transferred Equity Interests are being
acquired by Acquiror (or each Designated Purchaser) for its own account, and
not with a view to, or for the offer or sale in connection with, any public
distribution or sale of the Transferred Equity Interests or any interest in
them. Acquiror has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Transferred Equity Interests, and Acquiror is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss of
its investment in the Transferred Equity Interests. Acquiror acknowledges that
the Transferred Equity Interests have not been registered under the Securities
Act, or any state securities Laws, and understands and agrees that it may not
sell or dispose of any of the Transferred Equity Interests except pursuant to
a registered offering in compliance with, or in a transaction exempt from, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable
state, foreign or federal securities Laws.

Section 4.07. _Financial Ability_. At the time of the Closing, Acquiror will
have sufficient immediately available funds and the financial ability to pay
the Purchase Price and any expenses incurred by Acquiror and any Designated
Purchasers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.08. _Brokers._ Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the " _Acquiror s Bankers_"), no
broker, finder or investment banker is or might be entitled to any brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Acquiror. Acquiror is solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
Acquirors Bankers.

Section 4.09. _Solvency_. Immediately after the Closing and assuming
compliance by Seller and its Affiliates with all their obligations hereunder
and the accuracy of Sellers representations and warranties herein, Acquiror
will be (i) "well capitalized" (as that term is defined at 12 C.F.R. §
5.39(d)(11) or the relevant regulation of Acquirors primary federal bank
regulator), and (ii) in compliance with all capital requirements, standards
and ratios required by each federal bank regulator with jurisdiction over
Acquiror.

Section 4.10. _Investigation_. ACQUIROR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT ( _I_
) HAS MADE ITS OWN INQUIRY AND INVESTIGATION INTO, AND, BASED THEREON, HAS
FORMED AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT CONCERNING, SELLER, THE TRANSFERRED EQUITY
INTERESTS, THE ASSETS, THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES AND ANY OTHER ASSETS, RIGHTS OR
OBLIGATIONS TO BE TRANSFERRED HEREUNDER OR PURSUANT HERETO, AND ( _II_ ) HAS

29  FURNISHED WITH, OR GIVEN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO, SUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE
TRANSFERRED EQUITY INTERESTS, THE TRANSFERRED SERVICING, THE COMPANY, THE
ACQUIRED BUSINESS, THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES AND ANY OTHER RIGHTS OR
OBLIGATIONS TO BE TRANSFERRED HEREUNDER OR PURSUANT HERETO, AS IT HAS
REQUESTED. ACQUIROR FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (I) THE ONLY
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS MADE BY SELLER ARE
THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS MADE IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, (II) THE ACQUIROR HAS NOT
RELIED UPON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR ANY PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS MADE OR
SUPPLIED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR BY ANY AFFILIATE OR REPRESENTATIVE OF
SELLER, (III) ACQUIROR WILL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY ARISING OUT OF ANY
SUCH REPRESENTATION OR PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS, (IV) ANY CLAIMS ACQUIROR MAY
HAVE FOR BREACH OF REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY SHALL BE BASED SOLELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE III_ HEREOF.

Company or any of their Affiliates; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
auditors and accountants of Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates
shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to any Person except in

any such consent or waiver) to obtain any consent or waiver necessary from any
Person to whom any contractual confidentiality obligation is owed in order to
disclose such information to Acquiror.

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 5.03_, from and after the
Closing Date, in connection with any reasonable business purpose, including
the preparation of Tax Returns, financial statements, the SEC reporting
obligations, or the determination of any matter relating to the rights or
obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates under any of the Transaction
Agreements, upon reasonable prior notice, and except as determined in good

such purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investigation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates and Acquiror and its Affiliates shall not be required to expend
any monetary resources in connection with such investigation; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the auditors and accountants of Acquiror or its Affiliates

relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such auditors or accountants.

(a) Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right to retain copies of all
books and records of the Company and the Acquired Business relating to
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Acquiror agrees that it shall

Business as Seller or its Affiliates shall reasonably request in connection
with any Action to which Seller or any of its Affiliates are parties or in
connection with the requirements of any Law applicable to Seller or any of its
Affiliates. Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall return such books
and records to Acquiror or such Affiliate as soon as such books and records

which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include records relating to the tax
basis and attributes of the Company and the tax basis in the Assets) in

or its Affiliates and not otherwise delivered to Acquiror (directly or
indirectly) for the longer of (i) any applicable statute of limitations and

longer period, Representatives of Acquiror and its Affiliates shall, upon
reasonable notice and for any reasonable business purpose, have access during
normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy such books and records.
During such six-year or longer period, Seller shall provide, or cause to be
provided to, Acquiror or its Affiliates, access to such original books and
records of the Company as Acquiror or its Affiliates shall reasonably request
in connection with any Action to which Acquiror or any of its Affiliates are
parties or in connection with the requirements of any Law applicable to
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates. Acquiror or its Affiliates, as applicable,
shall return such books and records to Seller or such Affiliate as soon as
such books and records are no longer needed in connection with the
circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates and Acquiror shall
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with such access or requirement of
applicable Law.

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between Acquiror and Seller are incorporated
into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
(and the confidentiality obligations thereunder shall be binding upon Acquiror
and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and representatives as if
parties thereto) until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Acquirors confidentiality obligations shall terminate only
in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the Acquired Business. If,
for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding any provision hereof or any provision of the Confidentiality
Agreement and subject to _Section 9.04_, the confidentiality obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall not prohibit or otherwise restrict
any communication, disclosure, filing press release or other public
announcement required by applicable Law or stock exchange rules.

 

(b) For a period of three years from the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential all nonpublic information in their
possession regarding the Acquired Business, and Acquiror and its Affiliates;
_provided_ that Seller shall not be required to maintain as confidential any
information (i) that becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates in violation of this
Agreement, (ii) as may be required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms of a
Governmental Order, under applicable Law or by any Governmental
Authority (including any self-regulatory organization on which Sellers
securities (or those of its Affiliates) are listed) or which otherwise has
regulatory or supervisory authority over Seller or its Affiliates or in the
course of inspections, examinations or inquiries by a regulatory or self-
regulatory organization that has requested or required the inspection of
records; _provided_ that Seller or such Affiliate advises the Person to which
such disclosure is made of the confidential nature of the information and, if
permitted by Law, regulation and applicable supervisory authority, gives
Acquiror such notice as may be reasonably practicable under the circumstances,
(iii) in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal
or informal investigative demand issued to Seller or its Affiliates in the
course of any Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent legally
permitted and reasonably practicable under the circumstances, Seller or any
such Affiliate shall notify Acquiror of such intended disclosure and
reasonably cooperate with Acquiror in its efforts to limit or restrict such
disclosure, at the sole cost of Acquiror, (iv) in order to enforce its rights
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, or (v) to the extent
that such information is or has become known to the Person receiving such
information on a non-confidential basis from a source who is not known by
Seller to be breaching any contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation by
making such disclosure.

Section 5.05. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.

(a) The parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) obtain, by the earliest practicable date, all authorizations, consents,

Agreements (including the Acquiror Governmental Consents and Seller
Governmental Consents, as applicable) and (ii) obtain, by the earliest
practicable date, the Rating Agency Confirmations and the BLT Trustee
Consents in respect of the transfer of the BLT

 



35  Servicing Rights to the Company and the acquisition of the Transferred
Equity Interests. Neither Seller nor Acquiror shall take any action that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required approvals and confirmations in any material
respect. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no party hereto shall be required to take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, that would be or
would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely impact the Acquiror and
the Acquired Business, taken as a whole, or the economic or business benefits
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Acquiror (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ").

(b) In addition, (x) Acquiror shall prepare and file, no later than 15 days
after the date of this Agreement, any and all applications, notices and
filings necessary or appropriate in order to obtain the Acquiror Governmental
Consents, and (y) each party agrees to make promptly any filing that may be
required with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any other antitrust or competition Law or by any other antitrust or
competition authority.

 

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, permit the
other party to review in advance any communication proposed to be made by such
party to any Governmental Authority and provide the other party with copies
of all correspondence, filings or other communications between them or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand (in each case, subject to redaction
for certain proprietary and confidential matters and any confidential
supervisory material). Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties
to this Agreement shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Nothing in this
_Section 5.05(c)_ shall be applicable to Tax matters or to _Section 5.12_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Acquiror
acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates Representatives that the operation of the Acquired Business shall
remain in the dominion and control of Seller until the Closing.

(e) From the date hereof until the Closing Date and within 15 Business Days
after the end of each:

(i) calendar quarter, Seller shall provide, for informational purposes only,
Acquiror with a data tape, in the form of the Loan Schedule with updated
information (of the type set forth in the Loan Schedule) with respect to the
Loans as of the end of such calendar quarter; and

(ii) calendar month, Seller shall provide, for informational purposes only,
Acquiror with a data file with updated Loan balances.

 



36 (f) Within 15 days after the date hereof, Acquiror shall deliver written
notice notifying Seller of the Permits that will not be required by
applicable Law to be held by the Company in order to conduct the Acquired
Business at the Company after Closing (the " _Specified Permits_ ").

 

Section 5.06. _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the Company shall
cease to be insured by Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies or by
any of their self-insured programs, other than by any insurance policies
acquired directly by and in the name of the Company or self-insurance programs
of the Company directly. With respect to events or circumstances relating to
the Acquired Business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that
are covered by Sellers or its Affiliates occurrence-based third party
liability insurance policies and any workers compensation insurance policies
and/or comparable workers compensation self-insurance, state or country
programs that apply to the locations at which the Acquired Business is
operated, Acquiror may make claims under such policies and programs to the
extent such coverage and limits are available under such policies and
programs; _provided_ , _however_ , that by making any such claims, Acquiror
agrees to reimburse Seller for any increased costs incurred by Seller as a
result of such claims, including any retroactive or prospective premium
adjustments associated with such coverage, as such amounts are determined in
accordance with those policies and programs generally applicable from time to

Affiliates (other than those of the Company) or to such workers compensation
insurance policies and/or comparable workers compensation self-insurance,

Business is operated. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall retain all
rights to control its insurance policies and programs, including the right to

whether any such policies or programs apply to any Liabilities of Acquiror or
the Company.

Disclosure Letter) between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, other than those
arising under the Ancillary Agreements. Seller shall terminate all

Liability or continuing obligation of the Company or the Acquired Business
thereunder.

action to ensure that the Company and its Subsidiaries cease unauthorized use
of the GE Name and GE Marks after the Closing, except as expressly authorized
in this _Section 5.09_, the Transitional Trademark License Agreement or
otherwise thereafter by Seller.

(c) Promptly after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than ten
Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror and its Affiliates shall make
all filings with any office, agency or body and take all other actions
necessary to effect the elimination of any use of the GE Name and GE
Marks from the corporate names, registered names or registered fictitious

respective Affiliates to execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable

Section 5.12. _Pre-Closing Restructuring Transactions_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or in
any other Transaction Agreement, prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause (i)
the Company to assign, transfer and convey to Seller and/or to one or more
Affiliates of Seller (and shall and shall cause such Affiliates to accept and
assume), all of the rights, assets, properties and Liabilities of the
Company, other than the Assets; (ii) it and its applicable Affiliates (other
than

 



39  the Company) to assign, transfer and convey to the Company (and shall cause
the Company to accept and assume) the Assets, each to the extent held by
Seller and its Affiliates; (iii) subject to _Section 5.13_, Seller shall
sell, convey, assign and transfer to the Company (and shall cause the Company
to accept and assume) all right, title and interest in and to the BLT
Servicing Rights (the " _Transferred Servicing_ ") free and clear of any
Liens; and (iv) the Company to transfer to Seller or any of its other
Affiliates any and all Excluded Liabilities (the transactions described in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) the " _Restructuring Transactions_ "). In
connection therewith and as part of the Restructuring Transactions, Seller
shall and shall cause its applicable Affiliates (other than the Company) to
properly record assignments of their interests in the Loan Collateral to the
Company in all jurisdictions where such interests have been recorded using
their respective commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing, and

Closing Statement. The parties agree that, from and after the Closing,
Sellers and its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand, and
Acquirors and its Affiliates (including the Company), on the other hand,
recourse as between each other with respect to the Restructuring Transactions
shall be exclusively pursuant to the Transaction Agreements; provided,
however, that, in the case of any particular transaction that is part of the
Restructuring Transactions, if such recourse is ineffective to give effect to
such particular transaction, then recourse may be had to the underlying or
relevant document or documents from the Restructuring Transaction to
the extent necessary to give effect to the transfer or conveyance intended
hereunder and thereunder.

(c) Seller shall bear all costs and expenses related to the Restructuring
Transactions and have sole responsibility for executing the Restructuring

and receive all consents and approvals of any type required in connection
therewith. Such documents shall be consistent with the terms of the
Transaction Agreements. Seller shall regularly consult with Acquiror and its
counsel in connection with the Restructuring Transactions and
regularly provide updates and information regarding the status thereof (such
updates to occur on at least a weekly basis), including copies of documents
related to the Restructuring Transactions. Acquiror shall be permitted the
opportunity in advance to review and comment upon all of the documentation
relating to the Restructuring Transactions and, with respect to the
documentation relating to the transactions described in clauses (a)(ii) and
(iii) of this _Section 5.12_ above, such documentation shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and its counsel. At or prior to
the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to have obtained all Restructured
Company Permits, and shall to the extent it has not already done so, provide
the Company with an original of all agreements of transfer, assignment or
assumption and other documentation relating to the

 



40  Restructuring Transactions (including a list of all Contracts (i) between
the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company), on the other, or (ii) between the Acquired Business, on the one
hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the
other).

(d) _Section 5.12_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a description
of the Restructuring Transactions as contemplated by Seller as of the date
hereof which Acquiror understands are subject to change by Seller (without
any requirement to obtain Acquirors consent therefor); _provided_ that such
changes are consistent with the terms of the this Section 5.12 and any
material changes are discussed with Acquiror and its counsel in advance.

(e) Seller shall effect and report the transfers related to the Restructuring
Transactions for all Tax purposes pursuant to the following:

(i) The total fair market value (" _Total FMV_ ") of the assets transferred
to the Company as a result of the Restructuring Transactions shall be equal to
the aggregate Purchase Price as defined by _Section 2.04_ plus the
liabilities taken into account for Tax purposes and held by the Company on
the Closing Date.

(ii) The fair market value of each Loan transferred to the Company as a result
of the Restructuring Transactions shall be equal to the unpaid principal
balance of each Loan on the transfer date plus the amount of accrued but
unpaid interest in respect of such Loan.

(iii) The fair market value of the Origination and Servicing Platform Assets
and, if applicable, the fair market value of the BLT Servicing Rights, shall
be equal to the Total FMV, less the fair market value of the Loans (as
determined in _Section 5.12(e)(ii)_).

Section 5.13. _BLT Servicing Transfer Matters_.

(a) If the Rating Agency Confirmations or the BLT Trustee Consents are not
obtained before October 1, 2012, then Seller shall have the right from and

and financial assets related to such Assumed Liabilities) to such Person;
_provided_ that, subject to _Section 5.13(b)_, Seller may not enter into any
definitive, binding agreement with, or make any binding commitment to, any
Person with respect to any such sale or transfer (other than a confidentiality
agreement on customary terms and without any grant of exclusivity or
any similar right to such other Person). Seller shall notify Acquiror in
writing of its intention to commence any of the foregoing activities.

(b) If the Rating Agency Confirmations or the BLT Trustee Consents are not
obtained before November 1, 2012, then Seller (i) shall have the right, from

(and related Assumed Liabilities and financial assets related to such Assumed
Liabilities) to the Company in accordance with _Section 5.12_, and, further,
to enter into any agreement with any Person to sell, and to sell and transfer
to any Person, all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the BLT

 



41  Servicing Rights, and (ii) shall, subject to Sections 5.13(c) and (e), have
no further obligation to transfer the BLT Servicing Rights to the Company in
accordance with  _Section 5.12_ or otherwise to Acquiror. Any such election
shall be made by, and shall be effective upon, delivery of written notice
thereof to Acquiror.

(c) If, in accordance with this _Section 5.13_, prior to the Closing, Seller
elects not to transfer the BLT Servicing Rights to the Company as required by
_Section 5.12_, or the Rating Agency Confirmations or the BLT Trustee
Consents are not otherwise obtained prior to the Closing, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by $20,000,000.00. If (i) Seller completes any sale or
transfer of the BLT Servicing Rights in accordance  _Section 5.13_ prior to
the Closing, then the Purchase Price shall be further reduced by an amount
equal to 75% of the proceeds (net of any reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses to third parties incurred by Seller solely and directly related to
such sale or transfer) (such net proceeds, the " _BLT Sale Proceeds_ ") from
the sale or transfer of the BLT Servicing Rights to a third party in excess of
$20,000,000.00 (such amount, the " _BLT Excess Proceeds_ ", which amount
shall equal zero to the extent the amount of the BLT Sale Proceeds is a
negative number), and (ii) Seller completes any sale or transfer of the BLT
Servicing Rights in accordance with _Section 5.13_ within eighteen months
after the Closing, then Seller shall deliver the BLT Excess Proceeds to an
account designated by Acquiror in writing within three Business Days of
receipt of the BLT Sale Proceeds.

 

(d) If, in accordance with this _Section 5.13_, prior to the Closing, Seller
elects not to transfer the BLT Servicing Rights to the Company as required by
_Section 5.12_, or the Rating Agency Confirmations or the BLT Trustee
Consents are not otherwise obtained prior to the Closing, from and after the
Closing and until Seller sells and transfers the BLT Servicing Rights to a
Person that is not an Affiliate of Seller, the Company shall, subject to the
consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
act as subservicer with respect to each of the Business Loan Trusts pursuant
to subservicing agreements to be entered into by the Company and Seller. Such
subservicing agreements shall be on customary terms to be agreed upon by
Seller and the Company in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing
Agreements, and shall provide for a subservicing fee equal, for so long as
the subservicing arrangement shall continue in accordance with its terms, to
(i) in respect of the period from and after the Closing Date until (and
including) the first anniversary of the Closing, the Companys actual costs
of performing subservicing services thereunder and (ii) for all periods after
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, a servicing fee calculated pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreements equal to
a "Master Servicing Fee Rate" of 25 basis points per annum, calculated in
accordance with the first two sentences of _Section 4.10_ of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreements. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good
faith to agree upon appropriate forms of subservicing agreements prior to the
Closing.

the BLT Servicing Rights are retained by Seller (and not transferred to
Acquiror, the Company or any third party) then until the earlier to occur of

$20,000,000 (the " _BLT Purchase Price_ "); _provided_ that nothing in this
Section 5.13(e) shall preclude Seller from agreeing to sell or selling the BLT
Servicing Rights to a third party at any time prior to receipt by Seller of
Acquirors notice to purchase the BLT Servicing Rights as contemplated by
this Section 5.13(e). Any notice delivered by the Acquiror to Seller pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence shall be irrevocable, and any purchase
shall occur not more than 15 days following Sellers receipt of such notice
(subject to Sellers receipt (by wire transfer of immediately available funds)
of the BLT Purchase Price at the closing of such sale).

 

(f) Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Article

48 ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.01. _Indemnification by Seller_. (a) From and after the Closing,
and subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Acquiror and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, stockholders, partners, members, employees
and agents and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (collectively, the " _Acquiror Indemnified Persons_ ")
against, and reimburse any Acquiror Indemnified Person for, all Losses that
such Acquiror Indemnified Person may suffer or incur, or become subject to,
directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from, whether in respect of
Third Party Claims, claims between any of the parties hereto, or otherwise: 

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement (determined with respect to all such representations and warranties
other than Excluded Representations without giving effect to any materiality (
_e.g._ , "material", "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect")), to be true
and correct;

 

(ii) any breach or failure by Seller to perform any of its covenants or
agreements made in this Agreement, or any other instrument, certificate or
document delivered by Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement;

(iii) any Excluded Liabilities of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii)
of the definition of Excluded Liabilities or the failure of Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company) to pay, perform and discharge when due the
same;

 

(iv) (A) any Third Party Claims relating to any Excluded Liabilities not
covered in _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_ and (B) any Special Non-Third Party
Liability Losses, but in each case, excluding any Loan Liabilities (it being
understood that any claims in respect of Loan Liabilities pursuant to this
Section 8.01 will be governed solely and exclusively by _Sections 8.01(a)(i)
and ((v)_ ; and

(v) any Loan Liabilities Losses.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, (i) Seller shall not
be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Acquiror Indemnified
Person for any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ (other than in respect
of any breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections
3.01_, _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.11(b)_ ,  _3.18(a)_ and _3.20_ (the " _Seller
Fundamental Representations_ ")) (A) in respect of any Losses from any single
claim or series of related claims or claims arising out of the same type of
underlying facts, events and circumstances unless such Losses exceed
$50,000.00 (each, a "Qualifying Claim") and (B) until the aggregate amount of
the Acquiror Indemnified Persons Losses in respect of Qualifying Claims
exceeds $3,000,000.00 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), after which Seller shall
only be obligated for such aggregate Losses of the Acquiror Indemnified
Persons for Qualifying Claims in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_
that the cumulative indemnification obligation of Seller (x) under _Section
8.01(a)(i)_, other than in respect of breaches of any of the Seller
Fundamental Representations, shall in no event exceed $300,000,000.00 (the "
_Cap_ ") and (y) under _Sections 8.01(a)(i), (ii), (iv) and (v)_, shall in
no event exceed the Purchase Price (the amount set forth in (y) being the "
_Fundamental Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, there shall be no limit regarding the amount or duration of
Sellers obligations under Section 8.01(a)(iii).

 



49 (c) In connection with any claim for indemnification based upon the breach of
a representation and warranty contained in _Section 3.18_, an indemnifiable
Loss and this _Section 8.01_ will arise only to the extent that the Loss is
caused by the facts which constitute a breach of such representation
and warranty and not by a deterioration (i) in the creditworthiness of the
Obligor or (ii) the value of the underlying real estate collateral based on
general economic or market conditions.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers sole obligation to indemnify the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons in respect of any Loan Liabilities pursuant to
this Section 8.01 shall be solely and exclusively governed by the provisions
of Sections 8.01(a)(i) and 8.01(a)(v).

Section 8.02. _Indemnification by Acquiror_.

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the other provisions of this

permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Persons_ ") against, and reimburse any Seller Indemnified Person
for, all Losses that such Seller Indemnified Person may suffer or incur, or
become subject to, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from,
whether in respect of Third Party Claims, claims between any of the parties
hereto, or otherwise:

 

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality qualification ( _e.g._ ,

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, (i) Acquiror shall
not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified
Person for any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ (other than in respect
of any breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Sections
4.01_ and _4.08_ (the " _Acquiror Fundamental Representations_ ")) (A) in
respect of any single claim or series of related claims or claims arising out
of the same type of underlying facts, events and circumstances unless such
Losses are in respect of Qualifying Claims and (B) until the aggregate amount
of the Seller Indemnified Persons Losses in respect of Qualifying Claims
exceeds the Deductible Amount after which Acquiror shall only be obligated
for such aggregate Losses of the Seller Indemnified Persons for Qualifying
Claims in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ that the cumulative
indemnification obligation of Acquiror (x) under _Section 8.02(a)(i)_, other
than in respect of breaches of any of the Acquiror Fundamental
Representations, shall in no event exceed the Cap and (y) under _Section
8.02(a)_, shall in no event exceed the Fundamental Cap.

 



50 Section 8.03. _Notification of Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Matters Agreement) (the "
_Indemnified Person_ "), shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") in writing of any pending
or threatened claim, demand or circumstance that the Indemnified Person has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Person,
such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim,
demand or circumstance; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Person from any of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_ unless the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices for
claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in _Section 9.01_ for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. 

(b) The Indemnifying Person may assume the defense of the Indemnified Person
against any Third Party Claim (including by employing counsel (other than
with respect to GE Controlled Claims), who shall be reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Person) by providing, within 30 days after delivery of notice
of such Third Party Claim, written notice to the Indemnified Person in which
the Indemnifying Person shall agree to assume such defense. Until the
Indemnifying Person shall have so assumed the defense of the Indemnified
Person against such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person may, but
shall not be obligated to, undertake the defense of such claim on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Person, and if such
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this _Article VIII_,
all reasonable legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the
Indemnified Person prior to such assumption shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Person. Any Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any action or claim the defense of which has been assumed by an
Indemnifying Person and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Person unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Person or (ii) the representation of
the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person by the same counsel would
be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest (
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
jurisdiction where such claim is asserted or relevant proceeding is
conducted). 

(c) The Indemnifying Person shall be authorized to compromise or settle any
pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnification
may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Person is an actual or
potential party to such action or claim) or consent to the entry of any
judgment, in each case, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, unless
such compromise, settlement, or judgment (A) does not, to the extent that an
Indemnified Person may have any liability with respect to such action or
claim,

 



51  include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnified Person of a written release from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) includes any statement as to or an
admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person or (C) involves in any manner any equitable relief against
the Indemnified Person, where, in each of cases (A), (B) or (C), the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required. The Indemnified Person
may not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to any Third Party Claims other
than GE Controlled Claims), or unless the sole relief granted is equitable
relief for which the Indemnifying Person would have no liability or to which
the Indemnifying Person would not be subject. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that it is reasonably likely
that a Third Party Claim, other than a GE Controlled Claim: (i) may
materially adversely affect it other than solely as a result of monetary
damages for which it could be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, or (ii) may have a significant and adverse effect upon the conduct
of its business or reputation of it or any Affiliate (which shall include any
claim based on an Action by a Governmental Authority), the Indemnified Person
may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the right to defend and
(subject to the following) compromise or settle such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Persons expense; _provided_ that the Indemnified Person shall
regularly coordinate, confer and consult with the Indemnifying Person in
connection with the defense of such claim and shall not settle or compromise
such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment in respect of
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) The Indemnifying Person shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the
Indemnified Person is kept duly and timely informed with respect to the status
of the Third Party Claim and the defense thereof, shall respond to any
reasonable queries from the Indemnified Person with respect to the same, and
shall, in conducting the defense and investigation of a Third Party Claim,
take into account any reasonable requests of the Indemnified Person. After any
Third Party Claim has been filed or initiated, the relevant Indemnified
Persons and Indemnifying Persons shall make available to the other parties
and their attorneys and accountants all pertinent information under their
respective control relating to such Third Party Claim which is not privileged,
confidential or proprietary in nature or which is made available under the
terms of a confidentiality agreement or is delivered or obtained under
appropriate protective orders reasonably satisfactory to such party, and to
render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each
other in order to facilitate the proper and adequate defense of any such Third
Party Claim.

 

Section 8.04. _Exclusive Remedies_. Seller and Acquiror acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of any Seller Indemnified
Person and any Acquiror Indemnified Person, respectively, for any Losses
(including any Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious
conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common
law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that it may at any time suffer
or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, any
breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or

 



52  agreement in this Agreement by any party hereto, except (i) in the case of
willful misconduct or fraud or with respect to matters for which the remedy of
specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable
remedies are available, (ii) with respect to the matters covered by _Sections
2.09_ through _2.11_ , or (iii) with respect to matters arising under any
Ancillary Agreement or the Tax Matters Agreement for which other remedies or
indemnification are provided thereunder.

Section 8.05. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) All indemnifiable Losses incurred in connection with any Transaction
Agreement or any other document executed in connection with the Closing shall
be offset by any third-party insurance proceeds (net of any actual costs,
expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such
proceeds) that have actually been recovered by the Indemnified Person in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification shall be
calculated on an After-Tax Basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Indemnified Person nor his, her or its Affiliates shall have any obligation
to seek to recover any insurance proceeds in connection with making a claim
under this _Article VIII, _except in connection with a claim for
indemnification based on breach of any representations and warranties in
_Section 3.18_, in which case the Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue available claims under any applicable title insurance
policies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall
have no liability to indemnify any Acquiror Indemnified Person with respect
to any Liability that is specifically reflected as a liability in the Final
Closing Statement solely to the extent of any amount reflected thereunder.

 

(b) If an Indemnifying Person makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Person pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
VIII_, such Indemnifying Person shall be subrogated, to the extent of the
amount of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Person
to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Person
as against any other Persons with respect to such Losses and with respect to
the claim giving rise to such Losses.

Section 8.06. _Limitation on Liability_. In no event shall any party have any
liability to the other (including under this _Article VIII_) for any
consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages, lost profits
or similar items (including loss of revenue, income or profits, diminution of
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to a breach or
alleged breach hereof), except to the extent awarded in connection with a
Third Party Claim. The right of an Indemnified Person to indemnification or
to assert or recover on any claim shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of or compliance
with, any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.07. _Mitigation_. Any party seeking indemnification under this
Article VIII will conduct itself in a reasonable and prudent manner in
seeking such indemnification consistent with the manner in which it would
conduct itself in the absence of this Article VIII; _provided_ that nothing
herein shall limit the obligations of the Indemnified Persons under Law to
mitigate damages in respect of any Losses.

Agreement in a manner inconsistent with the agreed press release or other
previously agreed communication plan in respect of this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be

55  Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 9.06. _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Agreements constitute the
entire agreement of Seller and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject
matter of the Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements,
undertakings and understandings, both written and oral, other than the

_further_ , that this Agreement (including the rights and interests and
obligations under this Agreement) may be assigned by Acquiror to any
Designated Purchaser _provided_ that no such assignment shall release Acquiror
from any Liability or obligation under this Agreement. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this  _Section 9.07_ shall be null and void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

parties to such agreement. No consent from any Indemnified Person under
_Article VIII_ (other than the parties to this Agreement) shall be required

parties hereto to waive any term or provision of this Agreement shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the

other inaccuracy, breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of
this Agreement.

warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement but such waiver of compliance with such

respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party granting such extension or waiver. Neither the waiver by any of the
parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
