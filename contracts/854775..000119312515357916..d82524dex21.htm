supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate. Buyer will and will cause the Company to cooperate reasonably and promptly with Seller and its representatives in
such examination, including providing answers to questions asked by Seller and its representatives, and Buyer will and will cause the Company to promptly make available to Seller and its representatives any records under Buyer&#146;s or the

within 30 days following delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to Seller, Seller has not delivered to Buyer written notice (the &#147;<B>Objection Notice</B>&#148;) of its objections to the Final Balance Sheet (such Objection Notice must contain a
statement describing in reasonable detail the basis of such objections), then Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses as set forth in such Final Balance Sheet will be deemed final and conclusive
and will be &#147;<B>Final Working Capital</B>,&#148; &#147;<B>Final Cash</B>,&#148; &#147;<B>Final Indebtedness</B>,&#148; and &#147;<B>Final Transaction Expenses</B>,&#148; respectively. The sole permissible grounds for objection shall be that the
determination of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Transaction Expenses was not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the definition(s) thereof. If Seller delivers the Objection Notice
within such 30-day period, then Buyer and Seller will endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of the 30-day period there are any objections
identified in the Objection Notice that remain in dispute, then either Buyer or Seller may submit such dispute for resolution to the Referee. The parties will instruct the Referee to determine Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness
and Final Transaction Expenses, as applicable, within 30 days after the objections identified in the Objection Notice that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If any remaining objections are submitted to the Referee for resolution, (i)&nbsp;Buyer
and Seller will enter into a customary engagement letter with the Referee; (ii)&nbsp;each such party will furnish to the Referee such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such objections as the Referee may reasonably request
and are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Referee any material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the
Referee; <I>provided</I> that all ex parte communications by the parties or their representatives with the Referee will be prohibited; (iii)&nbsp;to the extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in dispute, the Referee will
not assign a value to such objection that is greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either party; (iv)&nbsp;the determination by the Referee of Final
Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both parties by the Referee, will be made in accordance with this Agreement and will be binding and
conclusive on the parties and will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof; and (v)&nbsp;fees and expenses of the Referee shall be borne by
Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in such proportion that reflects the relative benefits received by Seller and Buyer from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if Seller challenges an item by an amount of $100,000 but the
Referee determines that Seller has a valid claim for only $40,000, Buyer shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Referee and the Seller shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. </P>
