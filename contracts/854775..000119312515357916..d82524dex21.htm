1.6 _Working Capital Adjustments_.

 

(a) Seller has delivered to Buyer an estimated balance sheet of the Company
prepared as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which sets
forth a good faith estimate of the amount of (i) Working Capital ("Estimated
Working Capital"), (ii) Cash ("Estimated Cash"), (iii) Indebtedness
("Estimated Indebtedness") and (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Estimated
Transaction Expenses"), in each case as of the Effective Time (which shall be
estimated prior to the application of any payments to be made under  _Section
1.4_). The Closing Balance Sheet has been prepared by Seller in accordance
with GAAP;

(b) If the Estimated Working Capital is less than (i) the Working Capital
Target minus (ii) Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), then the Closing Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the full amount by which the Working Capital Target
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital; 

(c) If the Estimated Working Capital is greater than (i) the Working Capital
Target plus (ii) Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), then the Closing Purchase
Price shall be increased by the full amount by which the Estimated Working
Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target; and

 

(d) Any adjustment pursuant to _Sections 1.6(b)_ or _1.6(c)_ , as the case may
be, shall be the "Closing Adjustment Amount."

(e) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to
Seller a balance sheet of the Company prepared as of the Effective Time (the
"Final Balance Sheet"), which will set forth the amounts of (i)Working Capital
("Closing Working Capital"), (ii) Cash ("Closing Cash"), (iii) Indebtedness
("Closing Indebtedness") and (iv) Transaction Expenses ("Closing Transaction

 



3  Expenses"), in each case as of the Effective Time (which shall be calculated
prior to the application of any payments to be made under _Section 1.4)_. The
Final Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Following the
delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to Seller, Buyer will and will cause the
Company to afford Seller and its representatives the opportunity to examine
the Final Balance Sheet, and such supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers
and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and
appropriate. Buyer will and will cause the Company to cooperate reasonably and
promptly with Seller and its representatives in such examination, including
providing answers to questions asked by Seller and its representatives, and
Buyer will and will cause the Company to promptly make available to Seller and
its representatives any records under Buyers or the Companys reasonable
control that are related to such examination and reasonably requested by
Seller and its representatives.

(f) If within 30 days following delivery of the Final Balance Sheet to
Seller, Seller has not delivered to Buyer written notice (the "Objection
Notice") of its objections to the Final Balance Sheet (such Objection Notice
must contain a statement describing in reasonable detail the basis of such
objections), then Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Transaction Expenses as set forth in such Final Balance Sheet will
be deemed final and conclusive and will be "Final Working Capital," "Final
Cash," "Final Indebtedness," and "Final Transaction Expenses," respectively.
The sole permissible grounds for objection shall be that the determination of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses was not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including the definition(s) thereof. If Seller delivers the Objection
Notice within such 30-day period, then Buyer and Seller will endeavor in good
faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the
date of delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of the 30-day period
there are any objections identified in the Objection Notice that remain in
dispute, then either Buyer or Seller may submit such dispute for resolution to
the Referee. The parties will instruct the Referee to determine Final Working
Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, within 30 days after the objections identified in the Objection
Notice that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If any remaining objections
are submitted to the Referee for resolution, (i) Buyer and Seller will enter
into a customary engagement letter with the Referee; (ii) each such party will
furnish to the Referee such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to such objections as the Referee may reasonably request and are
available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Referee any material relating to
the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination
with the Referee; _provided_ that all ex parte communications by the parties
or their representatives with the Referee will be prohibited; (iii) to the
extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in
dispute, the Referee will not assign a value to such objection that is
greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either party; (iv)
the determination by the Referee of Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness or Final Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as set forth in a
written notice delivered to both parties by the Referee, will be made in
accordance with this Agreement and will be binding and conclusive on the
parties and will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereof; and (v) fees and expenses of the Referee shall be borne
by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in such proportion
that reflects the relative benefits received by Seller and Buyer from the
resolution of the dispute. For example, if Seller challenges an item by an
amount of $100,000 but the Referee determines that Seller has a valid claim
for only $40,000, Buyer shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Referee
and the Seller shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses.

 

(g) The Closing Purchase Price will be adjusted to be: (i) reduced by the
amount, if any, to which: (A) the Final Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, subject to _Section 1.6(k)_, (B) the Final
Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness, (C) the Final Transaction
Expenses exceeds the Estimated Transaction Expenses, and (D) the Final Cash
is less than the Estimated

 



4  Cash; and (ii) increased by the amount, if any, to which: (A) the Final
Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, subject to
_Section 1.6(k)_, (B) the Final Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Indebtedness, (C) the Final Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated
Transaction Expenses and (D) the Final Cash exceeds the Estimated Cash.

 

(h) Any adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.6(g)_ shall be the "Final
Adjustment Amount".

 

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount results in a net decrease to the Closing
Purchase Price, then Seller will pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Final
Adjustment Amount.

(j) If the Final Adjustment Amount results in a net increase to the Closing
Purchase Price, then Buyer will pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the
Final Adjustment Amount.

(k) The determination of the Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to  _Section
1.6(g)_ shall be recalculated pursuant to the provisions in _Sections 1.6(b)_
and _1.6(c)_ using the Final Working Capital rather than the Estimated Working
Capital, and if the result thereof differs from the calculation based on
Estimated Working Capital, the Final Adjustment Amount shall be increased or
decreased, as appropriate (taking into account the amount that was paid or
received at Closing pursuant to _Sections 1.6(b)_ and _1.6(c)_ ), to
reflect the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price that would have
occurred if the Final Working Capital had originally been used to calculate
the Closing Adjustment Amount (and subject to the collar of $50,000 described
in _Sections 1.6(b)_ and  _1.6(c)_.

(l) All payments made to Buyer or Seller pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ will
be netted so that one payment will be made to Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
and such payment will be paid within five Business Days after Final Working
Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses become
binding and conclusive on the parties and will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts as are designated by
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, in writing within at least two Business Days
after Final Working Capital, Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and
Final Transaction Expenses become binding and conclusive on the parties.

ARTICLE 4

 

COVENANTS

4.1 _Non-Interference_. Seller will not take any action that is intended to
discourage any customer or client, licensor, supplier, employee, agent or
other business associate of the Company from maintaining the same business
relationships with the Company after the Effective Time as it maintained with
the Company before the Effective Time.

4.2  _Tax Matters_.

(a) Seller will prepare and timely and properly file (or cause to be prepared
and timely and properly filed) all (i) Tax Returns with respect to the
Company required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (after taking into
account extensions therefor) and (ii) consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns that include Seller and the Company that are required to be filed
before, on or after the Closing Date. Buyer will prepare and timely file (or
cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the
Company that Seller is not obligated to file (or cause to be filed) pursuant
to this _Section 4.2(a)_ or _Section 4.2(b)_ and Seller shall provide Buyer
with a list of all such Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods no later than
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. Seller will timely and properly
satisfy (or cause to be satisfied) in full when due all Taxes with respect to
(i) the Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company) for any Tax
period; (ii) the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (iii) a
member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the
Company (or any predecessor thereto) is or was a member before Closing in
which one or more entities other than the Company is or was also a
member, including Taxes pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 or
any similar applicable Legal Requirement; (iv) any Person (other than the
Company) imposed on the Company for any period as a transferee or successor
with respect to a transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date, by
applicable Legal Requirement, contract or otherwise; and (v) any Taxes imposed
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
one half of any Transfer Taxes (all of such Taxes being the "Pre-Closing
Taxes"). If Buyer is required under this _Section 4.2(a)_ to file any Tax
Return for Income Taxes that involves Pre-Closing Taxes, then no later than
ten (10) Business Days before the filing of any such Tax Return, Seller will
pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of Taxes shown due on such Tax
Return for which Seller is obligated with respect to such Tax Return. If any
Tax Return of the Company for Income Taxes prepared (or caused to be
prepared) by Buyer relates to any period that is a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
then Buyer will give to Seller a copy of such Tax Return as soon as
practicable after the preparation, but not later than fifteen (15) days
before the filing or due date thereof if earlier, thereof for Sellers review
and comment. Buyer will make any changes to such Tax Return that are
reasonably requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will only
be liable for any such Taxes described in this _Section 4.2(a)_ to the
extent that such Taxes exceed the sum of (1) the amount, if any, of estimated
Taxes paid for

 



23  such Taxes on or before the Closing Date plus (2) the amount, if any,
accrued for such Taxes in the Final Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to  _Section 1.6(f)_. Buyer may not amend any Tax Return of the
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period without Sellers prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld.

 

(b) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at Sellers expense, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company for all taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date with an initial due date (taking into account any
extensions properly obtained) after the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing
Return"). All Pre-Closing Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements and, to the extent not inconsistent with
applicable Legal Requirements, the past practice of the Company in preparing
their Tax Returns. Seller shall provide Buyer with each Pre-Closing Return
no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date thereof (taking into
account any extensions properly obtained) for Buyers review, comment and
filing.

 

(c) Each party will, and each party will cause its applicable Affiliates to,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect to Tax matters involving
the Company and provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested to enable the requesting party to complete and file all Tax Returns
it may be required to file (or cause to be filed) with respect to the Company,
to respond to Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax proceedings, and to
otherwise satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation also will include
promptly forwarding copies (to the extent related thereto) of (i) relevant Tax
notices, forms or other communications received from or sent to any
Governmental Entity and (ii) reasonably requested copies of all relevant Tax
Returns together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents
relating to rulings, audits or other Tax determinations by any Governmental
Entity and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property.

(d) In the case of any Taxes for any Straddle Period of the Company, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending at the end of the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any property
Taxes and other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis without regard to income,
receipts, sales, purchases or wages, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended at
the end of the Closing Date.

(e) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will pay
half of all Transfer Taxes, and Seller and Buyer will cooperate in timely
making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply
with the provisions of applicable Legal Requirements relating thereto.

 

(f) Any Tax refunds that are actually received by the Company or that the
Company or the Buyer elects to apply to reduce another tax liability that
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Seller and
Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund within fifteen (15) days after
receipt or election, net of any Taxes imposed upon Buyer or the Company by
reason of receipt or election with respect to such refund or in connection
with such refund; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Tax refunds are
subsequently disallowed, Seller shall pay over to Buyer the amount of any such
Tax refund within fifteen (15) days after such disallowance.

(g) This _Section 4.2(g)_ only relates to claims for indemnification
that involve a Tax Claim (and then only to such Tax Claim itself). In the
case of any conflict regarding the procedures applicable to the conduct of Tax
Claims set forth in this _Section 4.2(g)_ and _Section 8.2_, this  _Section
4.2(g)_ shall prevail. The Indemnitor for a Tax Claim will control (at its own
expense) all proceedings in

 



24  connection with such Tax Claim for a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date that the Indemnitor elects in writing to control within ten (10)
days of receiving notice of such Tax Claim (and if the Indemnitor elects to
control any such Tax Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate and observe the defense of such Tax Claim at the
Indemnitees expense), and, without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnitor
may in its sole discretion take actions (including with any of its Affiliates)
that include to pursue or forego any hearing, conference or other proceeding
with any applicable Governmental Entity with respect thereto, pay the Tax
claimed, sue for a refund (where Legal Requirements permit such a refund suit)
or contest such Tax Claim (including any combination of the foregoing), except
that Seller, at its own expense, will control (and may take such actions
with respect to) (but Buyer may participate in at its own expense) any
proceeding in connection with any Tax Claim relating solely to any Income Tax
with respect to the Company as a member of any combined consolidated or
unitary group with respect to any period ending on or before the Closing
Date, except that the Indemnitor and Indemnitee will jointly control any
proceeding in connection with any Tax Claim relating to any Income Tax with
respect to the Company with respect to a Straddle Period. Buyer shall control
any Tax Claim which Seller is not entitled to control, does not elect to
control, or fails to diligently pursue pursuant to this _Section 4.2(g)_.
Each party will not (and will cause each of its Affiliates not to) admit any
liability with respect to, settle or compromise, or appeal any adverse
determination in any Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other
party (which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or
withheld), except that Seller may admit any Liability with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any Tax Claim to the extent relating to Income Taxes of
or with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller
indemnifies Buyer without Buyers consent.

(h) Seller and each of its Affiliates will make or cause to be made (or join
in making, as applicable) an election under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(6) (and any corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Legal Requirement) in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to
this Agreement to reduce the Sellers tax basis in the Shares in lieu of
reducing any net operating loss, tax basis or other tax attributes of the
Company. Seller shall not make, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to
make, (i) any election pursuant to Section 336(e) of the Code in connection
with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) any other
election the effect of which would be to reduce any net operating loss, tax
basis or other tax attribute of the Company.

 

4.3 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) For a period of three (3) years commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), except as provided herein, Seller shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) own, operate,
manage, control, invest in or otherwise engage in any capacity in a Restricted
Business; (ii) have an interest in any Person that owns, operates, manages,
controls, invests in or otherwise engages directly or indirectly in a
Restricted Business in any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder,
member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or (iii)
intentionally interfere in any material respect with the business
relationships (whether formed prior to or after the date of this Agreement)
between the Company and any of its customers or suppliers, partners or other
business relationships. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may (A) own,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person
traded on any national securities exchange if Seller is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person, and in any case so long as and only if Seller or such Affiliate is not
involved in the management of such Person or its business and (B) provide
consulting services regarding the implementation, configuration and
customization of salesforce.com enterprise applications or enterprise

of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
the Company or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire
any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.3(b)_ shall prevent Seller or any
of its Affiliates from (i) hiring (A) any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the Company or Buyer for any reason at least six (6) months
prior to being hired by Seller or such Affiliate or (B) any employee whose
employment has been terminated by the employee at least twelve (12) months
prior to being hired by Seller or such Affiliate; or (ii) conducting general
solicitations of employment not targeted at the employees of the Company and
hiring any individuals who respond to such solicitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the foregoing provisos (i) or (ii) in this paragraph shall be
deemed to waive, terminate or otherwise affect in any respect any obligations
(with respect to restrictive covenants or otherwise) of any employee or former
employee of the Company or Buyer.

 

(c) If Seller breaches any of the provisions of this _Section 4.3_, Buyer and
the Company shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which
rights and remedies shall be independent of the others and severally
enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other rights and remedies available to any such Person under applicable
Legal Requirements:

(i) the right and remedy to have such provision specifically enforced by any
court having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach may cause irreparable injury to each of Buyer and the Company, the
amount of which cannot be readily determined and as to which neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing) will have any
adequate remedy at law or in damages, and that money damages may not provide
an adequate remedy to such Person; and

 

(ii) the right and remedy to recover from Seller all monetary damages suffered
by Buyer and the Company, as the case may be, as the result of any acts or
omissions constituting a breach of this _Section 4.3_.

(d) Seller recognizes and acknowledges that as of the Closing, it has
knowledge of confidential and proprietary information concerning the Company
and Buyer including information relating to financial statements, clients,
customers, potential clients or customers, employees, suppliers,
equipment, designs, drawings, programs, strategies, analyses, profit margins,
sales, methods of operation, plans, products, technologies, materials, trade
secrets, strategies, prospects or other proprietary information
("Confidential Information"); provided that Confidential Information shall
not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the
public, other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller in breach or
violation of this Agreement; (ii) becomes available to Seller on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Company or Buyer, provided
that such source of such information is not known by Seller to be bound by
a confidentiality agreement with Buyer or the Company regarding such
information; or (iii) was independently developed by Seller without use of, or
reference to, any of the information of the Company. In light of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, Seller shall maintain the
confidentiality of, and refrain from using or disclosing to any Person, all
Confidential Information, except to the extent disclosure of any such
information is required by Legal Requirement or any such information is in
the public domain through no wrongful act on the part of Seller or any of its
Affiliates or agents; provided however, that Sellers obligations pursuant to
this sentence shall terminate on the seventh anniversary of the Closing
with respect to all Confidential Information that does not constitute a trade
secret under applicable Legal Requirements, it being agreed that Sellers
obligations pursuant to this sentence with respect to Confidential Information
constituting a trade secret under applicable Legal Requirements shall last
indefinitely. In the event that Seller reasonably believes after consultation
with counsel that it is required by applicable Legal Requirement to disclose
any Confidential 

 



26  Information, Seller will (i) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirement, provide Buyer with prompt notice before such disclosure so that
Buyer may attempt to obtain a protective order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information and
(ii) cooperate with Buyer (at Buyers expense) in attempting to obtain such
order or assurance.

 

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section 4.3_
are reasonable and necessary in all respects, are necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Buyer and the Company and to protect and preserve the
value and the goodwill of Buyers and the Companys businesses, and constitute
a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller further agrees that the length of
time, scope and geographic coverage is reasonable given the benefits it has
received hereunder. Seller further agrees that it will not assert that
the Restricted Period or the scope or geographic coverage of the restrictions
contained in this _Section 4.3_ are unreasonable in any Legal Proceeding,
regardless of who initiates such Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that
this covenant does not preclude Seller from asserting in any Legal
Proceeding, regardless of who initiates such Legal Proceeding, that Buyers
interpretation of the scope of the restrictions contained in this _Section
4.3_ is unreasonable.

 

(f) In the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 4.3_ should be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Legal Requirements in any jurisdiction,
then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such
covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum
time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. The covenants contained in this _Section 4.3_
and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

4.4 _Waiver, Release and Discharge_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
successors, assigns and any other Person that may claim by, through or under
Seller, hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Company from
any and all Liabilities to Seller of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as
an equity holder of the Company or otherwise, including arising in
connection with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and Seller covenants and agrees that Seller shall not seek
to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from the
Company, other than Liabilities arising subsequent to the Closing under the
Transaction Documents and as otherwise permitted by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

(b) Effective upon the Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Company and each of their respective successors, assigns and any other Person
that may claim by, through or under Buyer or the Company, hereby irrevocably
waives, releases and discharges Seller from any and all Liabilities to the
Company of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether as parent of the Company
or otherwise, including arising in connection with the negotiation or
execution of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and Buyer covenants and
agrees that Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause the Company not to, seek
to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from Seller,
other than Liabilities arising subsequent to the Closing under the Transaction
Documents and as otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document.

 



27 4.5 _Agreement Not to Pursue_. Following the Closing, Seller shall not
initiate any Legal Proceeding against AJ Gallagher or its Affiliates with
respect to, or otherwise pursue, approach or engage in discussions with AJ
Gallagher or its Affiliates regarding, any amount due and owing to the Company
or Seller with respect to work performed by the Company prior to the Closing.

4.6 _Post-Closing Deliveries of Buyer_. Buyer shall deliver to Seller

after its receipt thereof.

 

4.8 _Insurance Coverage_

 

(a) Seller shall maintain insurance policies for directors and officers

insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date, including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, for the Company and all persons who were
directors or officers of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date, as
applicable; provided, however, that if Seller ceases to be a public
company, Seller will have no further obligation to maintain such insurance
but will offer to Buyer to purchase, and will purchase at Buyers expense if
so requested by Buyer, tail coverage for the remaining portion of the six (6)
year period beginning on the Closing Date with the same functional terms,
conditions, limits and/or deductible of the prior policies.

(b) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the cost of the Tail Policy promptly
after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 5

 

INDEMNIFICATION

5.1  _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the parties hereunder shall survive until the fifteen month
anniversary of the Closing Date, except that (i) (x) the representations
and warranties in _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.3_ , _2.4_ , _2.11_ and _2.17_
, (y) the representations and warranties in _Sections_ _3.1_ , _3.2_ and _3.5_
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
plus a period of 60 days (with respect to _Section 2.11_ giving effect to any
waiver or extension thereof for any Tax in question) (the representations and
warranties referred to in clause (x) being called the "Seller Specified
Representations") and the representations and warranties referred to in clause
(y) being called the "Buyer Specified Representations") and (z) the
representations and warranties in _Section 2.15(a)_ shall survive until the
third anniversary of the Closing Date; and (ii) the covenants shall survive
until they are fully performed in accordance with their terms. The expiration
of the applicable survival period of the representations and warranties
provided herein will not affect the rights of an Indemnitee in respect of any
claim that arises before the expiration of the applicable survival period and
is identified by such Indemnitee in a notice to the Indemnitor before such
expiration of the applicable survival period. Except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, no indemnification claim in connection with a
breach of a representation or warranty may be made under this  _Article 5_
after the expiration of the applicable survival period specified in this
_Section 5.1_.

5.2  _Indemnity_. Subject to the limitations and conditions in this _Article
5_ :

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing Date) and its and their
respective officers, directors, members, managers, partners, employees,
agents, stockholders, successors and permitted assigns (the "
_Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Damages incurred in connection
with, resulting from, relating to, or arising out of (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in _Article 2_ or in any certificate
delivered by Seller pursuant hereto, (ii) the nonfulfillment of any covenant
or agreement by or on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement, (iii)
Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses not otherwise paid in full at or prior to
the Closing or otherwise included in the calculation of the Purchase Price,
and (iv) any Pre-Closing Taxes.

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, members,
managers, partners, employees, agents, stockholders, successors and permitted
assigns (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Damages incurred
in connection with, resulting from, relating to, or arising out of (i) the
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in _Article 3_ or
in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto, or (ii) the
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by or on the part of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement.

 



29 5.3 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
5.2(a)(i)_ only when the aggregate amount of Damages for which Seller is
responsible under such Section exceeds $56,250 (and then only to the extent of
such excess); _provided_ , _however_ , that the deductible in this _Section
5.3(a)_ shall not apply to indemnification claims (i) for breaches of the
Seller Specified Representations, or (ii) arising from fraud (an element of
which is intent), willful or intentional misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation.

 

(b) Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
5.2(b)(i)_ only when the aggregate amount of Damages for which Buyer is
responsible under such Section exceeds $56,250 (and then only to the extent of
such excess); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limit on indemnification in
this _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not apply to indemnification claims (i) for
breaches of Buyer Specified Representations or (ii) arising from fraud (an
element of which is intent), willful or intentional misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation.

 

(c) Sellers aggregate Liability for indemnification claims under _Section
5.2(a)(i)_ will be limited to $1,125,000 (the "Sellers Aggregate
Indemnification Cap"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers Aggregate
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to indemnification claims against Seller
(i) for breaches of the Seller Specified Representations or (ii) arising from
fraud (an element of which is intent), willful or intentional misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation. In the case of breaches of the Seller Specified
Representations, Sellers aggregate Liability for indemnification claims
under Section _5.2(a)(i)_ , whether from a breach of the Seller Specified
Representations or otherwise, will be limited to the Purchase Price.

 

(d) Buyers aggregate Liability for indemnification claims under _Section
5.2(b)(i)_ will be limited to $1,125,000;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limit on indemnification in this _Section 5.3(d)_ shall not apply to
indemnification claims (i) for breaches of Buyer Specified Representations or
(ii) arising from fraud (an element of which is intent), willful or
intentional misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. In the case of Buyer
Specified Representations, Buyers aggregate Liability for indemnification
claims under _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ will be limited to the Purchase Price.

(e) _Computation of Claims_.

 

(i) If an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under more than one
provision of this Agreement, then such party shall be entitled to only one
indemnification or recovery of such claim to the extent it arises out of the
same circumstances and events; it being understood that this sentence is
solely to preclude a duplicate recovery by such Indemnitee (i.e., recovery
in excess of actual claims). To the extent that the claims for which Buyer or
its Affiliates may be entitled to be indemnified under this _Article 5_ are
also compensated to Buyer under the Purchase Price adjustment process
described in  _Section 1.6_, then Buyer shall not also be entitled to a
duplicate recovery by indemnification under this _Article 5_.

 



30 (ii) Whenever an Indemnitor is required to indemnify and hold harmless
an Indemnitee under this _Article 5_ , the Indemnitor will, subject to the
other limitations and provisions of this _Article 5_ , pay the Indemnitee the
amount of such indemnifiable claims reduced by the Net Proceeds of any
insurance policy actually paid to the Indemnitee with respect to such claims
(up to but not in excess of the amount of the applicable claim). For purposes
of this _Section 5.3(e)_, "Net Proceeds" shall mean the insurance proceeds
actually received, less any deductibles, co-payments, related premium
increases or other payment obligations (including reasonable attorneys fees
and other costs of collection) that relate to or arise from the making of the
claim for indemnification. The Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue Net Proceeds that would reasonably be expected to reduce or
eliminate or otherwise mitigate such claims. If any Indemnitee receives any
Net Proceeds after an indemnification payment is made with respect to such
claim, the Indemnitee shall promptly repay to the Indemnitor such amount of
the indemnification payment as would not have been paid by the Indemnitor for
the Net Proceeds reduced the original payment.

 

(iii) Any indemnity payment to be made by Seller pursuant to this Agreement
shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized on or prior to the date
such payment is due, or that will be realized within the same Tax year such
payment is due. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Tax Benefit" means the
reduction of Tax liabilities (calculated on the basis of the actual reduction
in cash payments for Taxes) resulting from an increase in deductions, losses
or tax credits or decrease in the income, gain or recapture of tax credits as
actually reported by the Buyer, in accordance with Legal Requirements in its
reasonable discretion, in any taxable period (or portions thereof) subsequent
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , if any such Tax Benefit is
subsequently disallowed (each, a "Disallowed Tax Benefit"), Seller will pay
to Buyer an amount equal to any such Disallowed Tax Benefit within fifteen
(15) days of such disallowance.

 

(iv) For the purpose of calculating Damages pursuant to this _Article 5_ (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, of determining whether a breach of a
representation or warranty has occurred), each of the representations and
warranties (other than the representation and warranty contained in _Section
2.10(a)_) that contains any qualifications as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to have been given as though there were no
such qualifications and any such qualifications shall be disregarded.

 

5.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification by a party
entitled to be indemnified under this _Article 5_  (an "Indemnitee") by
Seller or Buyer (each, an "Indemnitor"), will be asserted and resolved as
follows:

 

(a) If any claim or demand for which an Indemnitee may claim indemnity is
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnitee by a third
party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnitee will notify the Indemnitor as
promptly as practicable following the receipt by the Indemnitee of such Third-
Party Claim, which notice must specify the nature of such Third-Party Claim
and the amount, or the estimated amount, thereof to the extent then feasible
(which estimate will not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party
Claim) (the "Third-Party Claim Notice"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
failure so to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor from any
Liability it may have to the Indemnitee under this _Article 5_ unless, and
only to the extent that, such failure to so notify results in the loss of
material rights or defenses.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.4(c)_, an Indemnitor will have 30 days from the
date on which the Third-Party Claim Notice is duly given (the "Notice
Period") to notify in writing an Indemnitee whether or not the Indemnitor
desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnitee against such
Third-Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnitor may so assume
control of such

 



31  defense only if it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnitee that any
Damages that may be assessed against the Indemnitee in connection with such
Third-Party Claim constitute Damages for which the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification from the Indemnitor pursuant to this _Article 5_ (subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article 5_ ); _provided further_ , that if
in the course of defending such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor determines
in good faith through discovery or other means that the claims made in such
Third-Party Claim are not within the scope of and subject to indemnification
hereunder, then the Indemnitor shall provide the Indemnitee with notice of
such determination, at which time the Indemnitor shall no longer have the
right to conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If an Indemnitor does
not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim and it is determined that the
Indemnitor is liable therefor, then the Indemnitor must pay the Indemnitee
all Damages (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 5_ )
suffered by the Indemnitee as a result of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(c) If an Indemnitor so notifies an Indemnitee within the Notice Period that
it desires to defend the Indemnitee against such Third-Party Claim, then
(except as provided below) the Indemnitor will defend, at its sole cost and
expense, the Indemnitee by appropriate proceedings, will conduct the defense
in good faith and will control the conduct of such defense; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Indemnitor will not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee, consent to the entry of any judgment against the Indemnitee or
enter into any settlement or compromise that (A) does not include, as
an unconditional term thereof, the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
the Indemnitee of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnitee, from all Liability or admission thereof or any responsibility
in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (B) would impose any restriction on or
otherwise interfere with the business, properties or operations, in each case
of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates (including the Company after the
Closing), (C) would result in the finding or admission of any violation of a
Legal Requirement or (D) imposes Liability on the part of Indemnitee that will
not be fully satisfied by the Indemnitor. Furthermore, the Indemnitor will not
be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if the Third-Party
Claim seeks any relief (i) other than money damages, including any type of
injunctive or other equitable relief, (ii) involving criminal Liability, (iii)
in excess of Sellers Aggregate Indemnification Cap, or (iv) involving Taxes,
which shall be covered under _Section 4.2(g)_. If the defendants named in any
Third-Party Claim include both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, and the
Indemnitee will have reasonably concluded that there are legal defenses or
rights available to the Indemnitee that are in actual or potential conflict
with those available to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee will have the right to
select one law firm to act at the Indemnitors expense as separate counsel,
on behalf of the Indemnitee. In addition, if the Indemnitee desires to
participate in, but not control, any other defense or settlement, it may do so
at its sole cost and expense.

 

(d) If the Indemnitee will have a claim against the Indemnitor hereunder that
does not involve a Third-Party Claim but instead involves a claim among any
of the parties hereto relating to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated hereby (a "Non-Third-Party Claim" and, together with a Third-
Party Claim, a "Claim"), the Indemnitee will send a notice (which notice will
contain the information required for a Third-Party Claim Notice) with respect
to such Non-Third-Party Claim to the Indemnitor as soon as practicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure so to notify the Indemnitor will
not relieve the Indemnitor from any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee
under this _Article 5_ unless, and only to the extent that, such failure to so
notify results in the loss of material rights or defenses. Within 30
days after delivery of such notice, the Indemnitor shall deliver to the
Indemnitee a written response (the "Response") in which the Indemnitor shall
either: (i) agree that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive all of the
Damages claimed or (ii) dispute that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive
any or all of the Damages claimed and the basis for such dispute (in such an
event, the Response shall be referred to as an "Indemnity Objection Notice").
In the case of an Indemnity Objection Notice, during such 30-day period the
Indemnitee shall allow the Indemnitor and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Non-Third-
Party Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Non-Third-Party Claim and the Indemnitee shall assist the

 



32  Indemnitors investigation by giving such reasonable information and
assistance (including access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice to the Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine
and copy any relevant accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnitor or any
of its professional advisors may reasonably request, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee will, if reasonable, consult with
the Indemnitor and seek the Indemnitors input regarding appropriate methods
to resolve such Non-Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to reasonably consult with Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor
from any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee under this _Article 5_
unless, and only to the extent that, Indemnitor is actually damaged by such
failure to reasonably consult. If no Response is delivered by the Indemnitor
to the Indemnitee within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to
have agreed that an amount equal to the entire amount of the Damages claimed
and such amount shall be payable to the Indemnitee and shall be promptly paid
to the Indemnitee. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on
whether Damages exist or on the amount of such Damages within the 30-day
period after delivery of an Indemnity Objection Notice, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with  _Sections 6.7_ and _6.13_.

5.5 _Remedies_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive
remedy for money Damages following the Closing with respect to any and all
claims (except for claims arising from fraud (an element of which is intent),
willful or intentional conduct or intentional misrepresentation) arising out
of or relating to this Agreement will be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 5_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Article 5_ shall limit a Persons right to seek and obtain
any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any
remedy on account of any partys fraud, willful or intentional
misrepresentation or breach.

 

5.6 _Payment_.

(a) Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnitee under this _Article 5_
shall be made promptly upon (i) such amount becoming due and payable pursuant
to _Section 5.4(d)_, (ii) a final settlement among the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee or (iii) a final adjudication determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with this _Article 5_ that an
indemnification obligation is owing by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee (each,
a "Final Determination").

(b) Any claim not timely paid in accordance with _Section 5.6(a)_ shall bear
interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from the date of the
Final Determination, or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, and the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for any
and all reasonable costs or expenses of any nature or kind whatsoever
(including reasonable legal fees and costs) incurred in seeking to collect
such amount under this _Article 5_ , and no limitation in this _Article 5_
shall apply to any such interest or reimbursement.

 

5.7 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any indemnification received under this
_Article 5_ shall be treated by Buyer, Seller and their respective
Affiliates, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirement, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

5.8 _Set-Off Rights_.

(a) Buyer may at any time, at its option, set off any amount to which Buyer
has been determined to be entitled from Seller under this _Article 5_
pursuant to a Final Determination of a Claim, against any amount otherwise
payable by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement or any Transaction Document.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this  _Article 5_, Seller
will not be obligated to directly indemnify Buyer in respect of a Claim unless
and until Buyer has first exhausted its rights of set off against such Seller
under this _Section 5.8(a)_.

 



33 (b) If Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer is asserting a Claim, which
notice specifies the nature of such Claim, the amount of such Claim to the
extent known, or, if the amount is not known, the estimated amount of such
Claim determined in good faith by Buyer, and the basis for the calculation of
such actual or estimated amount, then, until there has been a Final
Determination of such Claim, there will be suspended Buyers obligation to pay
that portion of any amount otherwise payable by Buyer to Seller under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document equal to the actual or estimated amount
of such Claim as specified in such notice. Upon the Final Determination of
such Claim, Buyer will promptly pay to Seller any portion of such suspended
amount which, but for the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.8(b)_,
would have been due and payable under this Agreement or any Transaction

of this Agreement will be deemed to have been made under such other section
of the

or other item will not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made in this Agreement (unless the representation
or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself
or the mere listing of the document or item in the Disclosure Letter otherwise
reasonably informs Buyer of an exception to the representation or warranty).

Closing, execute, acknowledge and deliver any further assignments,
conveyances and other instruments of transfer reasonably requested by the
