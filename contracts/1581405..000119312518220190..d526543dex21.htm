Exhibit or Schedule hereto, the table of contents hereto and the index of defined terms are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation hereof. Any disclosure set forth in any Schedule of a Disclosure
Letter or otherwise shall be deemed set forth for purposes of any other Schedule to which such disclosure is relevant, but only to the extent that it is readily apparent on its face from the text of the disclosure made that such disclosure is
relevant to such other Schedule. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit, but not
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined herein. When a reference is made herein to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to
its permitted successors and assigns and shall be deemed to also include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. For all purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified herein, (a) &#147;or&#148; shall be construed in
the inclusive sense of &#147;and/or&#148;; (b) words (including capitalized terms defined herein) in the singular shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa and words (including capitalized terms defined herein) of one (1)&nbsp;gender

Schedules) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (d)&nbsp;all references herein to &#147;$&#148; or dollars shall refer to United States dollars; and (e)&nbsp;the terms &#147;include&#148;, &#147;includes&#148; or

warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein is breached, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) shall not detract
from or mitigate the breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires any Acquired Company to take any action prior to the Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to involve an undertaking on
the part of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary thereof to take such action. Any agreement, consent or waiver of the Company required or contemplated in connection with this Agreement shall mean the agreement, consent or waiver of the
Company acting through the Company Special Committee. Except to the extent a shorter time period is expressly set forth herein for a particular cause of action, actions hereunder may be brought at any time prior to the expiration of the longest time
period permitted by Section&nbsp;8106(c) of Title&nbsp;10 of the Delaware Code. Any cause of action for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall accrue, and the statute of limitations period shall begin to run, upon
the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section 9.8 <U><A NAME="ex2_1509944_92">

</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You have requested our opinion concerning the Company&#146;s election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a
&#147;<U>REIT</U>&#148;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;). This opinion is based on certain assumptions and factual representations concerning the business, assets and governing documents of the
Company, the Operating Partnership and any subsidiaries as set forth in a registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-4,</FONT> Registration No. [ &#9679; ], initially filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries, including an
examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of our
opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above referenced documents or in the Officers&#146; Certificate. In addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all
representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all

commencing with the Company&#146;s taxable year that ended on December&nbsp;31, 2014 through and including its taxable year that ends on the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed herein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This
opinion is rendered to you as of the date of this letter, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder and
interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Any such change may affect the conclusions stated herein. Our
opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on
the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those
set forth in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Officers&#146; Certificate may affect the conclusions stated herein. As described in the Joint Proxy Statement, the Company&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT depend
upon the Company&#146;s ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not
been and will not be reviewed by DLA Piper LLP (US). Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company&#146;s operation for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements. In addition, the opinion set forth
above does not foreclose the possibility that the Company may have to pay a deficiency dividend, or an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to maintain its REIT qualification. </P>
