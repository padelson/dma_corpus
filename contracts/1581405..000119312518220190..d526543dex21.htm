ending on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or to avoid incurring
entity level income or excise Taxes under the Code, including making dividend
or other distribution payments to stockholders of PECO in accordance with this

Section 5.3 _Go Shop; No Solicitation by the Company; Company Change in
Recommendation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_, during the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day thereafter (the " _Go
Shop Period End Time_ "), the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and
their respective Representatives (acting at the direction of the Company
Special Committee) may and shall have the right to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate, encourage or
assist any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal, including by
way of (A) contacting third parties or (B) providing access to the business,
properties, offices, assets, books and records and personnel of the Acquired
Companies and furnishing non-public information pursuant to (but
only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall concurrently provide to PECO
any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not
previously provided to PECO or its Representatives; (ii) engage in, continue
or otherwise

 



29

    

 participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding any
proposal, inquiries or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Competing Proposal or, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, furnish to any Person information or afford to any
Person access to the business, properties, assets or personnel of any of the
Acquired Companies, in each case, solely in connection with, or for the sole
purpose of knowingly encouraging, facilitating or assisting a Competing
Proposal; (iii) subject to and only in compliance with _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_, enter into any Contract (including any letter of intent or agreement
in principle) with respect to a Competing Proposal (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under
any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent, and only for
so long as necessary to allow the counterparty to make a Competing Proposal
or inquire, negotiate, evaluate, propose or make an offer that would be
reasonably likely to lead to a Competing Proposal prior to the Go Shop Period
End Time and in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, and (v)
disclose to the shareholders of the Company any information required to be
disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ that, in the case of
this _clause (v)_ , any such disclosure (other than a disclosure made
pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_) that addresses the
approval or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or the Company
Special Committee of the Transactions and that is not an express rejection of
any applicable Competing Proposal or an express public re-affirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Go
Shop Bidder_ " shall mean any Person or Group that submits a proposal or offer
regarding a Competing Proposal not later than the Go Shop Period End Time that
has not been withdrawn and that the Company Special Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, prior to the Go Shop Period End Time (or in the case of any Competing
Proposal received less than three (3) Business Days before the date of the Go
Shop Period End Time, not later than two (2) Business Days after the Go Shop
Period End Time), constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go
Shop Bidder if after the Go Shop Period End Time (I) the negotiations between
the Company and such Go Shop Bidder with respect to the Competing Proposal
that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go Shop Bidder shall have
been terminated, (II) the Competing Proposal submitted by such Go Shop Bidder
prior to the Go Shop Period End Time is withdrawn, terminated or modified in a
manner such that, in the Company Special Committees good faith
determination, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, as
modified it no longer constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, (III) the natural person(s) or entity(ies) comprising
such Go Shop Bidder cease, at any time following the Go Shop Period End Time
and prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, to constitute at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66.66%) of
the equity financing for such Competing Proposal, or (IV) such Go Shop Bidder
otherwise ceases to be actively pursuing efforts to acquire the Company or
the Company Operating Partnership. For the avoidance of doubt, until 11:59 PM
Eastern Time on the date that is fifteen (15) days after the Go Shop Period
End Time (the _"Go Shop Cut Off Time_ "), the Company, its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives may continue to take any of the
actions expressly listed in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ with respect to any
proposal or offer regarding a Competing Proposal submitted by a Go Shop
Bidder (but for only so long as such Person constitutes a Go Shop Bidder) on
or before the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or
modified proposal or offer with respect to any such Competing
Proposal submitted by a Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time (but
prior to the Go Shop Cut Off Time) if the Company Special Committee has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors, that such Competing Proposal (as may be amended or modified)
constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal.
For the sake of clarity, after the Go Shop Cut Off Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may continue to
engage in any of the activities contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_
with respect to a Go Shop Bidder only to the extent expressly permitted by the
remainder of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, from
and after the Go Shop Period End Time until the Company Merger Effective Time
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate, encourage or assist any inquiry or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Competing Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate

 



30

    

 in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal,
or furnish to any other Person information or afford to any other Person
access to the business, properties, assets or personnel of any of the Acquired
Companies, in each case, in connection with, or for the purpose of knowingly
encouraging, facilitating or assisting, a Competing Proposal, (iii) enter
into any Company Acquisition Agreement, (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or
release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement or any Takeover
Statute ( _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company may waive any provision that prohibits a confidential
proposal being made to the Company Special Committee or the Company Board of
Directors (directly or indirectly through the Companys Representatives))
or (v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make a
Competing Proposal.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, promptly
following the Go Shop Period End Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the other Acquired Companies and its and their respective Representatives
to, (i) immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons (other than Go Shop Bidders (but for only so long as such Persons
constitute Go Shop Bidders as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_) until
the Go Shop Cut Off Time and PECO and its Representatives) with respect to a
Competing Proposal and (ii) request that any such Person (other than Go Shop
Bidders (but for only so long as such Persons constitute Go Shop Bidders as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_) until the Go Shop Cut Off Time and
PECO and its Representatives) promptly return and/or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent
permitted pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with any such Persons.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, if at any time on or after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to
obtaining the Company Merger Approval, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a written Competing Proposal from any Person
or Group (including a Go Shop Bidder), which Competing Proposal was made on
or after the Go Shop Period End Time and was not preceded by a material breach
by the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (i) the Company and
its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons solely to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and
its Representatives may (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (a copy of which the Company shall promptly (and in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to PECO following the execution
thereof), information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or Group who has made such
Competing Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall concurrently provide
to PECO any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to PECO or its Representatives; and (B) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or Group
making such Competing Proposal. From and after the date hereof, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after any Acquired Company or any of its Representatives (x) enters into
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (y) receives any inquiry or
request for negotiations from any Person or Group regarding a Competing
Proposal, the Company shall notify PECO in writing of the identity of such
Person or Group (including, to the extent known by the Company, the identity
of each natural person or entity comprising such Group) and provide to PECO
(1) a copy of any Competing Proposal made by (or on behalf of) such Person or
Group and any other written material terms and conditions or proposals
provided by (or on behalf of) such Person or Group (including a copy of any
acquisition agreement and any related transaction documents and financing
commitments, if any, and any subsequent amendments thereto) to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of any Acquired Company and (2) a
written summary of any other material terms of any Competing Proposal from any
such Person or Group not made in writing (including any material terms
and conditions proposed orally or supplementally). For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing notice obligations in the preceding sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ shall also apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , to any Go Shop
Bidder, as discussed in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_.

 



31

    

(e) Following the date hereof, the Company shall keep PECO reasonably informed
on a current basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Competing Proposal (whether made before or after the date
hereof) and upon the request of PECO shall apprise PECO of the status of such
Competing Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any agreement with any Person or Persons subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to PECO in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

(f) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_, the
Company Special Committee and the Company Board of Directors shall not (x)
(A) fail to recommend to the Companys stockholders that the Company
Stockholder Approval be given or fail to include the Company Board

Company a Competing Proposal, or (E) fail to make or reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following PECOs written
request to do so following the Companys or its Representatives receipt of a
Competing Proposal or any material change thereto (each of the actions
described in this _clause (x)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (y) authorize, cause or permit any Acquired
Company to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (z) take any action pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
prior to the time the Company Merger Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Company Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ and enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal, if
and only if, the Company receives a Competing Proposal that was not preceded
by a material breach by the Company of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and each of
the Company Special Committee and the Company Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith that, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that, in order to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal:

 

(i) each of the Company Special Committee and the Company Board of Directors
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company shall have given PECO at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination and the identity of the party making
such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and include copies of
the current drafts of all material agreements between the Company and the
party making such Superior Proposal and relating to such Superior Proposal
(to the extent in the Companys possession);

(iii) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with PECO during such notice
period, to the extent PECO wishes to negotiate; and

 

(iv) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors
shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement
proposed by PECO (or as to other proposals made by PECO) in writing, and shall
have determined, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel that such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect; _provided_ ,
that, in the event of any material change to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to PECO
an additional notice consistent with that described in _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)(ii)_ above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that
the notice period shall be at least two (2) Business Days; and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ shall be void and of no

 



32

    

 force and effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ and the Company pays PECO the Company Termination
Payment in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_.

(g) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
of Directors from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, in either case, if the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would create a material
risk of a breach by the Company of its duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that any disclosures (other than those made pursuant to _clause
(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_) that address the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board of Directors of the Transactions and that
are not an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an
express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company or any of its or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives to, reimburse or agree to
reimburse the fees or expenses of any Person (including any Go Shop Bidder or
its Representatives) in connection with (or related to) a Competing
Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal entered into pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ and
resulting in termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_.

 

(i) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by any Acquired Company or the
Representatives of any Acquired Company acting at the direction of the Company
or any other Acquired Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3_ by the Company.

 

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than PECO or any of its
Subsidiaries) or Group relating to, in a single transaction or series of

equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys consolidated assets or
to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on
a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) acquisition of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock,
(iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or (v) any combination of the foregoing
types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,

percent (20%) or more, in each case, other than the Transactions.

(k) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide, written Competing Proposal that was not preceded by a material breach by
the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and that the Company Board of
Directors has determined that, after consulting with the Companys outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, such Competing Proposal is reasonably
likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and that, if
consummated, would reasonably be likely to result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Transactions (including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by PECO in response to such Competing Proposal or otherwise); 
_provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ,"
the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Competing

circumstances not involving or relating to a Competing Proposal and at any
time prior to the receipt of the Company Merger

Indebtedness or guarantees thereof for which the Debt Consents and Amendments
of such lenders or servicers are required, if such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver material increases the net worth, liquidity or
reserve requirements with respect to such applicable Indebtedness without the
prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

the extent the DandO Indemnified Parties would be permitted to be indemnified by
the Company under the Acquired Company Organizational Documents and applicable
law) shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party
against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission
in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as such, or (B) this Agreement and
any of the Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of

entitled to be indemnified and (B) an affirmation by the DandO Indemnified Party

necessary for indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, PECO
shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of an DandO Indemnified Party for which

(6) years covering each DandO Indemnified Party that provides coverage, subject
to such policys terms and conditions, for matters occurring prior to the
Closing (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") that is no less favorable than the
applicable Acquired Companys existing policy (true, correct and complete
copies of which have been previously provided to PECO prior to the date
hereof) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , that the premium for such DandO Tail
Policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) If any of PECO or PECO OP or any of their respective successors or assigns

be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of PECO or PECO OP, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ are intended to be for
the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified
Party (who are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this

 



41

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_), his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of PECO, PECO
OP and the Acquired Companies and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to the DandO Indemnified Parties (including their respective successors,
assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the DandO Indemnified
Party (including, if applicable, the successors, assigns and heirs thereof)
affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights
to which a DandO Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable
Law, Contract or otherwise.

Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act as a result of the Transactions) to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.6  _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any Proceeding
related to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other Transactions is brought
against the Company, on the one hand, or PECO, on the other hand (either
the Company or PECO, as applicable, against whom such litigation is brought,
the " _Participating Party_ _"_ , and the other, the _"_ _Other Party_ _"_
_),_ its Representatives and/or Affiliates by security holders of the
Participating Party (each, a _"Security Holder Litigation"_ ), the
Participating Party shall promptly notify the Other Party of such litigation
and shall keep the Other Party informed on a current basis with respect
to the status thereof. The Participating Party shall give the Other Party the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in
the defense and settlement of any such litigation against the Participating
Party, its Representatives and/or Affiliates by security holders of the

withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.9 _Dividends_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Company
Merger Effective Time and termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1_, neither the Company nor PECO shall authorize, make, declare or set
aside any dividend or other distribution to its stockholders without the prior
written consent of the Company (in the case of PECO) or PECO (in the case of
the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that the written consent of the other
Party shall not be required for the authorization and payment by the Company
of dividends in the Ordinary Course of Business (" _Company Permitted
Dividend_ ") or by PECO of dividends in the Ordinary Course of Business (a "
_PECO Permitted Dividend_ ", and together with the Company Permitted
Dividends, each a " _Permitted Dividend_ "), as applicable. In the event that
(i) a Company Permitted Dividend has (A) a record date prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time and (B) has not been paid as of immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time (regardless of the declared date for the
payment thereof), the holders of Company Shares shall be entitled to receive
such distribution from the Company immediately prior to the time such shares
are exchanged pursuant to _Article II_ or (ii) a PECO Permitted Dividend has
(A) a record date prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and (B) has not
been paid as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time
(regardless of the declared date for the payment thereof), the holders of
shares of PECO Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such distribution
from PECO in connection with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
any other restriction on dividends and other distributions in this Agreement,
each of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, PECO, and any PECO Subsidiary
shall be permitted (without the consent of the other Party) to declare and
make dividends and distributions, including under Sections 858 or 860 of the
Code, prior to the Closing if the making of such dividends or distributions
prior to the Closing is necessary for the Company or PECO, as applicable, to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or applicable state Law and avoid
the imposition of any entity level income or excise Tax under the Code or
applicable state Law. If the Company or PECO, as applicable, determines that
it is necessary to declare a dividend or distribution (whether a Company
Permitted Dividend, a PECO Permitted Dividend or otherwise), it shall notify
the PECO or the Company, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable
prior to such declaration.

 

(b) The Parties shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that if the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units receive the
Company Permitted Dividend for a particular period prior to the Closing Date,
or the holders of PECO Common Stock and PECO OP Units receive the PECO
Permitted Dividend for a particular period prior to the Closing Date, then the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units or the holders
of PECO Common Stock and PECO OP Units, as the case may be, shall be entitled
to receive the applicable Permitted Dividend for such period as necessary to
result in the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units
and the holders of PECO Common Stock and PECO OP Units receiving the
applicable Permitted Dividend (or any portion thereof) covering the same
periods prior to the Closing Date. The timing of any such dividends will be
coordinated so that, if either the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Partnership Units or the holders of PECO Common Stock and PECO OP Units
receive a distribution for a particular period prior to the Closing
Date, then the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Partnership Units
and the holders of PECO Common Stock and PECO OP Units, respectively, shall
receive a distribution for such period prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.10 _C_ _ertain Transactions_.

 

(a) Effective immediately prior to, but subject to, the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company and PECO shall terminate, or cause to
be terminated, without liability or expense to the Company or any Acquired
Company, the Advisory Agreement pursuant to a termination agreement entered
into on or prior to the Closing Date, a copy of which is attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Termination Agreement_ ").

(b) Between the date hereof and the Company Merger Effective Time, neither
PECO nor PECO OP shall agree or consent to substitute any alternative earn
out with respect to the PEGC III Earn-Out, or otherwise agree to amend or
modify any earn out payable to the Contributors in connection with
the Contribution Transaction.

 



44

    

Section 6.11 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by any Party, each Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to _Section 6.2_ ) as
such other Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
Transactions.

(i) if PECO provides a notice of termination and such termination would result

Termination Payment, as applicable, the payment of such Go Shop Termination

49

the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the other Company Related

has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to multiple provisions of
this Agreement, PECO may elect under which provision it is providing notice
of termination.

(ii) if the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement and such
termination would result in the obligation to pay the PECO Termination

damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not impair the rights of the Company or the Company

if the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to multiple
provisions of this Agreement, the Company may elect under which provision it
is providing notice of termination.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) If one Party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is required
to pay another Party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payee_ ") any
payment under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ or _8.2(c)_ (such payment, a "
_Termination Payment_ "), such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow
on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Payor
pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of same day funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_. In the
event that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee a
Termination Payment, the amount payable to the Termination Payee in any
taxable year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (A) such
Termination Payment payable to the Termination Payee, and (B) the sum of (I)
the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination Payee without causing
the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code for the relevant taxable year, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the
Termination Payee has income from unknown sources during such year in an
amount equal to one percent (1%) of its gross income which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case, as determined by the Termination Payees independent
accountants, __plus__ (II) in the event the Termination Payee receives either
(x) a letter from the Termination Payees outside counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ or (y) a written legal opinion from the
Termination Payees outside counsel as described below in this _Section_ __ _
8.2(e)_, an amount equal to the excess of such Termination Payment, __less__
the amount payable under _subclause (I)_ above.

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to such
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on
such terms (subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_) as shall be mutually
agreed upon, in good faith, by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee
and the escrow agent (the " _Termination Payment Escrow Agent_ ") via an
escrow agreement by and among such Persons (or their respective Affiliates)
(the " _Termination Payment Escrow Agreement_ "). The payment or deposit into
escrow of such Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_
shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the
Termination Payee such amount pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by wire
transfer of same day funds. The Termination Payment Escrow Agreement shall
provide that such Termination Payment (or any portion thereof) shall remain
in escrow and shall not be released to the Termination Payee unless the
Termination Payment Escrow Agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (A) a letter from the 

 



50

    

 Termination Payees independent accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid by the Termination Payment Escrow Agent to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Termination Payee has
income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to one
percent (1%) of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition
to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which
case the Termination Payment Escrow Agent shall release such amount to
the Termination Payee, or (B) a letter from the Termination Payees outside
counsel indicating that (I) the Termination Payee received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of such Termination
Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or
(II) the Termination Payees outside counsel has rendered a written legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of such
Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the Termination Payment Escrow Agent shall release
the remainder of such Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The
Termination Payor agrees to amend this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ at the
reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order to (x) maximize the
portion of such Termination Payment that may be distributed to the Termination
Payee hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (y) reasonably
assist the Termination Payee (at the Termination Payees expense) in obtaining
a favorable ruling or written legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each
case, as described in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_. Any amount of such
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at the end of the second (2nd) calendar year beginning after
the date on which the Termination Payors obligation to pay the Termination
Payment arose (or earlier if directed by the Termination Payee), any remaining
portion of the Termination Payment (together with interest thereon) then being
held by the Termination Payment Escrow Agent shall be disbursed to the
Termination Payor and, in the event the Termination Payment has not by then
been paid in full, such unpaid portion shall never be due.

 

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that none
of the Go Shop Termination Payment, the Company Termination Payment nor the
PECO Termination Payment is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the PECO Parties, on the one hand, or
the Company and Company Operating Partnership, on the other hand, as
applicable, in the circumstances in which the Go Shop Termination Payment, the
Company Termination Payment or the PECO Termination Payment is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and in reliance on this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. The headings contained herein and in
any Exhibit or Schedule hereto, the table of contents hereto and the index of
defined terms are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation hereof. Any disclosure set forth in any Schedule
of a Disclosure Letter or otherwise shall be deemed set forth for purposes of
any other Schedule to which such disclosure is relevant, but only to the
extent that it is readily apparent on its face from the text of the disclosure
made that such disclosure is relevant to such other Schedule. All Exhibits
and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in
and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit, but not otherwise defined therein, shall
have the meaning as defined herein. When a reference is made herein to a
Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an
Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns and
shall be deemed to also include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such
Person, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All
references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include
all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated
or the context otherwise requires. For all purposes of this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified herein, (a) "or" shall be construed in the inclusive
sense of "and/or"; (b) words (including capitalized terms defined herein) in
the singular shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa and words
(including capitalized terms defined herein) of one (1) gender shall be
construed to include the other gender as the context requires; (c) the terms
"hereof" and "herein" and words of similar import shall be construed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole (including all the Exhibits and Schedules) and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (d) all references herein
to "$" or dollars shall refer to United States dollars; and (e) the terms
"include", "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement contained herein shall have independent significance. Accordingly,
if any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein is
breached, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the
relative levels of specificity) shall not detract from or mitigate the breach
of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Whenever this
Agreement requires any Acquired Company to take any action prior to the
Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to involve an undertaking on the
part of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary thereof to take such
action. Any agreement, consent or waiver of the Company required or
contemplated in connection with this Agreement shall mean the agreement,
consent or waiver of the Company acting through the Company Special
Committee. Except to the extent a shorter time period is expressly set forth
herein for a particular cause of action, actions hereunder may be brought at
any time prior to the expiration of the longest time period permitted by
Section 8106(c) of Title 10 of the Delaware Code. Any cause of action for
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall
accrue, and the statute of limitations period shall begin to run, upon the
date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 9.8 _ Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually,
electronically by email or by facsimile by the Parties, in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the PECO
Disclosure Letter) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

(b) Except (i) as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, (ii) the right
of the former holders of Company Common Stock to receive, from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ (subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, as applicable) and (iii) the
rights of the Advisor pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ and _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)_, this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the PECO
Disclosure Letter) is not intended to confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Mergers is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Mergers are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Governing_ _Law_ _; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Maryland without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles (whether of
the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

 

(b) All Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City,
Maryland, or if jurisdiction over the matter is vested exclusively in federal
courts, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and the
appellate courts to which orders and judgments thereof may be appealed
(collectively, the " _Acceptable Courts_ "). In any such Proceeding, each of
the parties further consents to the assignment of any Proceeding in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland to the Business and Technology Case
Management Program pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-205 (or any successor
thereof). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Acceptable Court, for the
purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the Transactions brought by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such
Proceeding except in such Acceptable Courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in any Acceptable
Court, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such Proceeding in such Acceptable Courts, and (v) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Proceeding in such Acceptable Courts. Each of the Parties
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or
support any Proceeding of any kind or description (whether at law, in contract
or in tort) against any debt financing source in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any

 



65

    

 dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any debt commitment letter,
third party debt financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the
City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 9.12_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any
such Proceeding.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGERS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) __ IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (C) __ IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) __ IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that PECO and PECO OP may assign, in
their sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all
of their rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of their lenders
or other financing sources from time to time as collateral security. Subject
to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.14_, including the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.14(c)_, it is agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any other
Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

(c) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity), and each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the
terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.14_. In the event any Party seeks an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
9.14_.

Exhibit B

 

TERMINATION AGREEMENT

 

This TERMINATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of [●], 201[●], is
entered into by and among Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), Phillips Edison Grocery Center
Operating Partnership II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the " _Company
Operating Partnership_ " and, together with the Company, the " _Company
Parties_ "), Phillips Edison NTR II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Advisor"), Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (" _PECO OP_ ") and Phillips Edison and Company,
Ltd., an Ohio limited liability company (" _Manager_ " and, together with
Advisor and PECO OP, the " _PECO Parties_ "). Capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, the Company, the Company Operating Partnership, Phillips Edison and
Company, Inc., REIT Merger Sub, LLC (" _REIT Merger Sub_ "), OP Merger Sub,
LLC and OP Merger Sub 2, LLC (" _OP Merger Sub_ ") are parties to
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July [●], 2018 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (i) the Company will merge with and
into REIT Merger Sub with REIT Merger Sub being the surviving entity in
the merger, and (ii) OP Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
Operating Partnership with the Company Operating Partnership being the
surviving entity in the merger, in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth therein;

 

WHEREAS, certain of the Company Parties and certain of the PECO Parties are
parties to agreements set forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto (the "
_Related Party Agreements_ ");

WHEREAS, following the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
the Company Parties will no longer require the services contemplated by the
Related Party Agreements; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 7.3(g) of the Merger Agreement, the obligation
of the Company Parties to effect the Mergers is partially conditioned upon the
effectiveness of this Agreement as of the Closing Date.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

Section 1.  _Termination of Related Party Agreements_. Effective as of
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Related Party
Agreements are hereby terminated and shall be of no further force or effect,
without any further liability or obligation on the part of any party thereto,
except for those provisions of the Related Party Agreements which expressly
survive any termination pursuant to their respective terms. Each of the
Company Parties and PECO Parties acknowledges and agrees that no fees or
compensation, nor any other payment, shall be due or payable in connection
with the termination of the Related Party Agreements, the Mergers or the other
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of the PECO Parties shall be
entitled to all unpaid fees accrued under the Related Party Agreement to which
it is a party in the ordinary course prior to the Closing. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably waives any notice of termination requirements under the
Related Party Agreements to which it is party. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Agreement will become effective immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, but is expressly conditioned on the consummation of the
Mergers. Accordingly, if the Mergers do not occur or the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be null and void
and of no force or effect.

 

Section 2\. _Amendment_. This Agreement may only be amended, modified and
supplemented by the written agreement of the parties hereto, with respect to
the Company Parties, with the prior approval of the Company Special Committee,
and with respect to the PECO Parties, with the prior approval of the PECO
Board of Directors.

   

Section 3\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually,
electronically by email or by facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties.

Section 4\. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect.

 

Section 5\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland).

 

Section 6\. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

     | Re: | _Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc._ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 7.2(d) of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of July [ ● ], 2018 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")
by and among Phillips Edison and Company, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( "
_PECO_ "), REIT Merger Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of PECO (" _REIT Merger Sub_ "), Phillips Edison
Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
and subsidiary of PECO (" _PECO OP_ "), OP Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of PECO OP (" _OP Merger Sub
GP_ "), OP Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
subsidiary of PECO OP and OP Merger Sub GP (" _OP Merger Sub_ "), Phillips
Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership II, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership and a subsidiary of the Company (the " _Operating
Partnership_ "), with respect to the merger of the Company with and into REIT
Merger Sub, with REIT Merger Sub surviving the merger, and certain other
transactions. Any undefined capitalized terms herein have the same meaning as
such terms in the Merger Agreement. 

You have requested our opinion concerning the Companys election to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). This opinion is based on certain
assumptions and factual representations concerning the business, assets and
governing documents of the Company, the Operating Partnership and any
subsidiaries as set forth in a registration statement on Form S-4,
Registration No. [ ● ], initially filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on [ ● ], 2018, as amended through the date hereof
(together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
") included therein. We have also been furnished with, and with your consent
have relied upon, (i) certain representations made by the Company and the
Operating Partnership with respect to certain factual matters through a
certificate signed by an officer of the Company and an officer of the
Operating Partnership, dated as of the Closing Date (the " _Officers 
Certificate_").

 

In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal
and factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of originals
or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such
documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary
or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of our opinion,
we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth
in the above referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of
all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to
knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification. In our examination,
we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of
natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.

We are opining herein only as to the federal income tax laws of the United
States, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto,
or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, the laws of any state or other
jurisdiction, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other
local agencies within any state.

 

Based on such facts, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions,
representations and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion
that commencing with the Companys taxable year that ended on December 31,
2014 through and including its taxable year that ends on the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the
Code. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed herein.

This opinion is rendered to you as of the date of this letter, and we
undertake no obligation to update this opinion subsequent to the date hereof.
This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated
thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and
the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to
change either prospectively or retroactively. Any such change may affect the
conclusions stated herein. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of
a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or
of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in
regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of
counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels best professional
judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue,
if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS
or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary
position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a
position asserted by the IRS. Also, any variation or difference in the facts
from those set forth in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Officers Certificate may affect the conclusions stated herein. As
described in the Joint Proxy Statement, the Companys qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend upon the Companys ability to meet the various
qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual
operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of
stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed
by DLA Piper LLP (US). Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual
results of the Companys operation for any particular taxable year will
satisfy such requirements. In addition, the opinion set forth above does not
foreclose the possibility that the Company may have to pay a deficiency
dividend, or an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount,
in order to maintain its REIT qualification.

 

This opinion is rendered only to you and is solely for your benefit in
connection with the transaction described above. This opinion may not be
relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted to, or
relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity, for any purpose,
without our prior written consent. This opinion may, however, be disclosed by
you to your legal advisers and/or to the extent required by law or regulation
or in seeking to establish any defense in any legal or regulatory proceeding
or investigation relating to the matters set out herein in each case for
purposes of information only on the strict understanding that we assume no
duty or liability whatsoever to any such recipient as a result of any such
disclosure.

     | Re: | _Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [ ● ], 2018_ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We have acted as special tax counsel to Phillips Edison and Company, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the proposed
merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (" _PECO II_ ") with and into REIT Merger Sub, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(" _REIT Merger Sub_ "), with REIT Merger Sub surviving the Merger. The Merger
will be consummated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [
● ], 2018 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "). The Merger is described in the
registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. [ ● ]) initially filed by
the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on [ ● ], 2018, as
amended through the date hereof (the " _Form S-4_"), which includes the joint
proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Merger (the " _Joint Proxy
Statement_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings
specified in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

In acting as special tax counsel to the Company in connection with the
Merger, we have participated in the preparation of the Merger Agreement, and
pursuant to Section 7.2(e) of the Merger Agreement, you have requested our
opinion regarding whether, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth herein, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"). In rendering our opinion, we have examined and, with
your consent, are expressly relying upon (without any independent
investigation or review thereof) the truth and accuracy of the factual
statements, representations and warranties contained in (i) the Merger
Agreement (including any Exhibits and Schedules thereto), (ii) the Form S-4
and the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) the respective tax representation letters
of the Company and of PECO II delivered to us for purposes of this opinion
(the " _Officer s Certificates_"), and (iv) such other documents and
corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of
our opinion.

 

In addition, we have assumed, with your consent, that:



     | 1. | Original documents (including signatures) are authentic, and
documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original documents, and
there has been (or will be by the Company Merger Effective Time) execution
and delivery of all documents where execution and delivery are prerequisites
to the effectiveness thereof; 
---|---|--- 
   

[ ● ], 2018

 

Page 2



   ![LOGO](g509944g01a07.jpg) 





     | 2. | The Merger will be consummated in the manner contemplated by,
and in accordance with the provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4
and the Joint Proxy Statement, and the Merger will be effective under the
laws of the State of Maryland; 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | All factual statements, descriptions and representations
contained in any of the documents referred to herein or otherwise made to us
are true, complete and correct in all respects and will remain true, complete
and correct in all respects up to and including the Company Merger Effective
Time, and no actions have been taken or will be taken which are inconsistent
with such factual statements, descriptions or representations or which make
any such factual statements, descriptions or representations untrue,
incomplete or incorrect at the Company Merger Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | Any statements made in any of the documents referred to
herein "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified or that are based on any
persons "belief," "expectation" or similar qualification are true, complete
and correct in all respects and will continue to be true, complete and correct
in all respects at all times up to and including the Company Merger Effective
Time, in each case without such qualification; and  
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | The parties have complied with and, if applicable, will
continue to comply with, the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement.  
---|---|--- 

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and
limitations stated in the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement, the Officers
Certificates and herein, we are of the opinion that, for United States federal
income tax purposes, the Merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

In addition to the matters set forth above, this opinion is subject to
the exceptions, limitations and qualifications set forth below.



     | 1. | This opinion represents our best judgment as of the date
hereof regarding the application of United States federal income tax laws
arising under the Code, existing judicial decisions, administrative
regulations and published rulings and procedures, but does not address all of
the United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. We express no
opinion as to United States federal, state, local, foreign, or other tax
consequences, other than as set forth herein. Our opinion is not binding upon
the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there is no assurance that the
Internal Revenue Service will not assert a contrary position. Furthermore, no
assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or administrative
changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would not adversely
affect the accuracy of the conclusions stated herein. Nevertheless, we
undertake no responsibility to advise you of any new developments in the
application or interpretation of the United States federal income tax laws. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | No opinion is expressed as to any transaction other than the
Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Officers Certificates, or to any transaction whatsoever,
including the Merger, if, to the extent relevant to our opinion, either all
the transactions described in the Merger Agreement are not consummated in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and without waiver or
breach of any provisions thereof or all of the factual statements,
representations, warranties and assumptions upon which we have relied are not
true and accurate at all relevant times.

     | Re: | _Phillips Edison and Company, Inc._ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 7.3(d) of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of [ ● ], 2018 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by
and among Phillips Edison and Company, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "
_Company_ "), REIT Merger Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (" _REIT Merger Sub_ "), Phillips
Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership and subsidiary of the Company (the " _Operating Partnership_ "),
OP Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (" _OP Merger Sub GP_ "), OP Merger
Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of the
Operating Partnership and OP Merger Sub GP, Phillips Edison Grocery Center
REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _PECO II_ "), and Phillips Edison
Grocery Center Operating Partnership II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
and subsidiary of PECO II (" _PECO II OP_ "), with respect to the merger of
PECO II with and into REIT Merger Sub, with REIT Merger Sub surviving the
merger, and certain other transactions.

 

You have requested our opinion concerning the Companys election to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). This opinion is based on certain
assumptions and factual representations concerning the business, assets and
governing documents of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their
subsidiaries as set forth in a registration statement on Form S-4,
Registration No. [ ● ] initially filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on [ ● ], 2018, as amended through the date hereof
(together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
") included therein. We have also been furnished with, and with your consent
have relied upon, (i) certain representations made by the Company, the
Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries with respect to certain factual
matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company, and (ii) certain
representations made by PECO II, PECO II OP and their subsidiaries with
respect to certain factual matters through a certificate of an officer of
PECO II, each dated as of the date hereof (together, the " _Officer s
Certificates_").

In our capacity as special tax counsel to the Company, we have made such
legal and factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of
originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction 

   

[ ● ], 2018

 

Page 2



   ![LOGO](g509944g01a07.jpg) 



of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed
necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. For the purposes of our
opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts
set forth in the above referenced documents or in the Officers Certificates.
In addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy
of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to
knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification. In
our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal
capacity of natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to
authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.

We are opining herein only as to the federal income tax laws of the United
States, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto,
or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, the laws of any state or other
jurisdiction, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other
local agencies within any state. 

Based on such facts, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions,
representations and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that:



     | 1. | Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010,
through its taxable year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has been
organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The Companys current organization and proposed method of
operation will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code for its taxable year beginning January
1, 2018 and subsequent taxable years. 
---|---|--- 

No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed herein.

 

This opinion is rendered to you as of the date of this letter, and we
undertake no obligation to update this opinion subsequent to the date hereof.
This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated
thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the
courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to
change either prospectively or retroactively. Any such change may affect the
conclusions stated herein. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from
those set forth in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Officers Certificates may affect the conclusions stated herein. As
described in the Joint Proxy Statement, the Companys qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend upon the Companys ability to meet the various
qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual
operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of
stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed
by Latham and Watkins LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the
actual results of the Companys operation for any particular taxable year will
satisfy such requirements. In addition, the opinion set forth above does not
foreclose the possibility that the Company may have to pay a deficiency
dividend, or an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount,
in order to maintain its REIT qualification.

 

This opinion is rendered only to you and is solely for your benefit in
connection with the transaction described above. This opinion may not be
relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted to, or
relied upon by any other person, firm or other entity, for any purpose,

subsidiary of PECO OP and OP Merger Sub GP ("OP Merger Sub", and, together
with PECO, PECO OP, REIT Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub GP, collectively, the
"PECO Parties"), the Company, and Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating
Partnership II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and subsidiary of the
Company (the "Company Operating Partnership"). This opinion letter is being
delivered to you pursuant to Section 7.3(e) of the Merger Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein and which are defined in the Merger Agreement
shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise
defined herein.

In connection with the preparation of this opinion letter, we have
examined, and with your consent relied upon, without any independent
investigation or review thereof, the following documents (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto): (1) the Merger Agreement; (2) the
registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. [ ● ]) initially filed by
PECO with the Securities and Exchange Commission on [ ● ], 2018, as amended
through the date hereof (the "Form S-4"), which includes the joint proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the Company Merger (the "Joint Proxy
Statement"); (3) officers certificates delivered by each of the Company and
PECO to us for purposes of this opinion, both dated as of the date hereof (the
"Tax Certificates"); and (4) such other instruments and documents related to
the formation, organization, and operation of the Company and PECO or to the
consummation of the Company Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby
as we have deemed necessary or appropriate (the documents described in clauses
(1) through (4), collectively the "Reviewed Documents"). In addition, we have
reviewed the form of opinion of counsel to be delivered to PECO pursuant to
Section 7.2(e) of the Merger Agreement concurrently herewith (the "PECO
Opinion").

 

Assumptions and Representations

In connection with rendering this opinion, we have assumed or obtained
representations (which with your consent we are relying upon, and upon which
our opinion is premised, without any independent investigation or review
thereof), including that:

relevant to our opinion, (B) all copies are accurate, (C) all signatures are

     | (2) | There will have been, by the Company Merger Effective Time,
or at such other time as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, due execution
and delivery of all documents, where due execution and delivery are
prerequisites to the effectiveness thereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | To the extent relevant to our opinion, all representations,
warranties, and statements made or agreed to by the PECO Parties, and by the
Company and the Company Operating Partnership, their respective
managers, employees, officers, directors, and stockholders in connection with
the Company Merger, including, but not limited to, those in the Reviewed
Documents (including the Tax Certificates), have been and will continue to be
true, complete, and accurate in all respects; any representation or statement
made in the Tax Certificates "to the best of knowledge," "to the knowledge,"
or "to the actual knowledge" of any person(s) or party(ies)or
similarly qualifiedis true, correct, and complete, as if made without such
qualification. 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | The Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with
its terms. The Company Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
Merger Agreement (including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and
conditions to the obligations of the parties, without amendment, waiver, or
breach thereof), the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. The Company
Merger will qualify as a merger under the applicable laws of Maryland. 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | Each of the Company and PECO will comply with all reporting
obligations with respect to the Company Merger required under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (6) | The PECO Opinion is being delivered to PECO concurrently
herewith in the form provided to us, and the PECO Opinion has not been and
will not be modified or withdrawn. 
---|---|--- 
 

Opinion

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein
we are of the opinion that the Company Merger, when effective, will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

* * * * * 

In addition to the assumptions set forth above, this opinion is subject to
the exceptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth below:



     | (1) |

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and
temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as
expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the
administrative rulings and practices of the IRS, including its practices and
policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS
except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the
date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change
by the IRS, Congress, and the courts (as applicable), which change may or may
not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications
of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary
determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, nor of a
contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsels best professional judgment with
respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue
were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts
and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with
respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
asserted by the IRS. Neither 

---|---|--- 
   

Board of Directors

 

Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc.

[ ● ], 2018 

Page 3



     | the Company nor PECO has requested or will request a ruling from
the IRS as to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences addressed in
this opinion. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future
legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, including on a retroactive
basis, would not adversely affect the accuracy of the opinion expressed
herein. 
---|--- 



     | (2) | This letter addresses only the specific tax opinion set
forth above. Our opinion does not address any other U.S. federal, state,
local, or non-U.S. tax consequences that will or may result from the Company
Merger or any other transaction (including any transaction undertaken in
connection with the Company Merger or contemplated by the Merger Agreement). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | Our opinion set forth herein is based upon, among other
things, the description of the contemplated transactions (including the
Company Merger) as set forth in the Merger Agreement. No opinion is expressed
as to any transaction other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement, or
to any transaction whatsoever, including the Company Merger, unless all the
transactions described in the Merger Agreement (or otherwise contemplated in
connection with the Company Merger) have been consummated in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement (and also without amendment, waiver, or
breach of any provision thereof), and also unless all of the representations,
warranties, statements, and assumptions upon which we have relied are true,
complete, and accurate at all times. In the event that the actual facts
relating to any aspect of the relevant transactions (including the Company
Merger) differ from the terms of the Merger Agreement (without amendment,
waiver, or breach of any material provision thereof), or if any one of the
representations, warranties, statements, or assumptions upon which we have
relied to issue this opinion is incorrect, our opinion might be adversely
affected and may not be relied upon. 
---|---|--- 

This opinion letter has been prepared solely for your use in connection with
the Company Merger and speaks as of the date hereof. We undertake no
responsibility by reason of this opinion letter or otherwise to advise you or
any other person of any changes in our opinion subsequent to the delivery of
this opinion letter. This opinion letter may not be relied on by any other
person, or for any other purpose, without our prior written consent, which may
be withheld in our sole discretion. This opinion letter may not be
distributed, quoted in whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any
document, or filed with any governmental agency without our prior written
consent.

Very truly yours,
