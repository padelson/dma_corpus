 **AGREEMENT**

  

In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable

pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company and
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii)
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the Company, as the surviving

 **SECTION 1.2** Effective Time; Closing Date.

  

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger

such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing) to the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing as provided in the
DGCL, and shall make all other deliveries, filings or recordings required by
the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on
the date on which the Certificate of Merger is duly filed in accordance with
the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL, or on such other later date as is
agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate

is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

  

(b) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00
A.M., Pacific Time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than two (2) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of

 **SECTION 1.3** Effect of the Merger.

  

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and assets of the Company

forth therein, which shall be "Eschelon Telecom, Inc.", until thereafter
amended as provided by Law and such certificate of incorporation.

  

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name

appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

 **SECTION 1.6** Further Assurances.

  

If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall

 **ARTICLE 2 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; CONSIDERATION**

  

 **SECTION 2.1** Conversion of Shares.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") without any interest thereon.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the holder thereof, each share
of Common Stock that is owned by (i) the Company as treasury stock, (ii)
Parent, (iii) Merger Sub, (iv) any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
(v) any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

  

(d) All shares of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall cease to be
outstanding, and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such certificate.

  

(e) Each Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be converted into the right to
receive, at the Effective Time, a sum in cash equal to such OptionÂ’s Option
Cancellation Payment, without interest, and all such Options shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each former Option Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than the right to receive the consideration set forth herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
exercise price per share of Common Stock of any

        

Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Option
shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Any payments made pursuant to this
Section 2.1(e) shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes, which shall
be properly and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity. As of
the Effective Time, the Option Plan shall terminate and all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company shall be cancelled.

  

(f) The restrictions on each share of Restricted Stock shall lapse
immediately prior to, and effective upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, and each share of Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder
thereof at such time, and each such share of Restricted Stock will be treated
at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to
the same conditions (including the conditions set forth in Section 2.2)
hereunder as, each share of Common Stock not subject to any restrictions as
provided in Section 2.1.

  

 **SECTION 2.2** Exchange Procedures.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent to act
as agent for the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the
Merger and to receive the funds to which such holders shall become entitled
pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
deliver, in trust, to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section
2.1(a).

  

(b) Promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be mailed, or otherwise make available, to each holder of record of
Certificates entitled to receive consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 the
form of Letter of Transmittal. After the Effective Time, each holder of
certificates or other instruments formerly evidencing shares of Common Stock
(the " _Certificates_ "), upon surrender of such Certificates to the Paying
Agent, together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, shall be
entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange therefor,
the aggregate consideration for such shares of Common Stock, in cash
as contemplated by this Agreement, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
be cancelled. The Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock, such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Parent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Parent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall properly and timely remit any
such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2 (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after

        

the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the aggregate
consideration for such shares of Common Stock, in cash as contemplated by
this Agreement, without interest thereon. All cash consideration delivered
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificates. At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to such lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent, the posting
by such Person of a bond or other surety in such amount as the Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with
respect to such Certificate and subject to such other reasonable conditions
as the Parent may impose, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such
Certificate the consideration into which shares of Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this
Article II.

  

(d) If any payment under this Article II is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name any Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer
or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or such Person
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. At any time
following the expiration of one (1) year after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
that has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and such funds shall
thereafter become the property of the Surviving Corporation. Such funds may
be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Corporation and shall
be free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person. Thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable consideration payable as
contemplated by this Agreement (net of any amounts that would be subject to
withholding) upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon.

  

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfer in the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.2.

   

5  

   

(g) Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten
(10) days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, in
exchange for the Options that became entitled to receive the consideration
specified in Section 2.1, make the Option Cancellation Payment in respect of
each such Option to each Option Holder. The Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Option Holder such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation or Parent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax
Law or with respect to the making of other payments hereunder in connection
with other equity interests in the Company held by such Option Holder
(provided that such amounts have not been previously deducted and withheld).
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Option Holder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable,
shall properly and timely remit any such withheld amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

  

 **SECTION 2.3** Dissenting Shares.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of the CompanyÂ’s capital stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders who shall not have voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall be entitled
to and have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 2.1. Such holders shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders not entitled by
Section 262 of the DGCL, or who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the consideration specified in Section 2.1, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.2, of
the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting
Shares.

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.  The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Material Adverse Effect. To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, there are no conditions
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the operation of their
businesses, or relating to any real property used, leased or formerly owned,
used or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that in any such

delay consummation of the Merger or (c) would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no injunction,
writ, temporary restraining order, decree or any order of any nature has been

and rights required by Governmental Entities and other third Persons
(collectively, " _Permits_ ," a true, correct and complete list of which is
contained in _Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule_ ) that are
necessary or required to conduct their respective businesses as presently
being conducted, except for such Permits the failure to hold would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
(i) such Permits are in full force and effect, (ii) no violations are or have
been alleged in respect of any thereof, (iii) no proceeding is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of

and the Communications Licenses constitute all of the licenses from the FCC,
the State PUCs, Municipal Franchising Authorities or any other Governmental
Entity that regulates telecommunications in each applicable jurisdiction that
are necessary or required for the operation of the businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as now conducted other than any such licenses (other
than Material Communications Licenses), the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All the
Communications Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, unimpaired by
any material condition, except those conditions that may be contained within
the terms of such Communications Licenses. No action by or before the FCC,
any State PUC or any other Governmental Entity that
regulates telecommunications in each applicable jurisdiction is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in which the requested remedy is
(i) the revocation, suspension, cancellation, rescission or material
modification or refusal to renew any of the Communications Licenses, or (ii)
material fines and/or forfeitures. The Universal Service Administration
Company has not initiated any inquiries, audits or other proceedings against
the Company or its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such
actions are threatened which, in each case, would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, if not cured or otherwise responded

of the Company or any such Subsidiary (other than commercially available
standard software applications used in the CompanyÂ’s or any such SubsidiaryÂ’s
operations not material to the operation of Network Facilities), indicating
for each the title and the parties thereto. Each material agreement granting
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any material right under or with
respect to any Intellectual Property owned by a third party that is used in
connection with the business of the Company or any such Subsidiary is either
paid-up in full or all right-to-use fees have been paid and are current. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in (i) the loss or impairment of the right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to own or use any Intellectual Property material to the
operation of the business by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) the
payment of any material amounts with respect to the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any Intellectual Property.

the time immediately following any amendment or supplement to the Proxy

 **SECTION 4.6** Litigation.

  

There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or to

 **SECTION 4.8** Financing.

  

Parent has, or shall have at the Closing and at the Effective Time,
sufficient funds available to permit Parent and Merger Sub to perform all of
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate all of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has received executed
commitment letters (the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., CIBC Inc, and from
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., CIBC

        

World Markets Corp., collectively " _Lenders_ ," pursuant to which
Lenders have committed to provide Parent, Merger Sub and certain existing or
future subsidiaries of the Parent with a credit facility and notes in an
aggregate amount necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Financing_ "). The Financing is adequate to pay in full in cash (a)
the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Option Cancellation
Payment (in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), (b)
all fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub associated with the

rescinded in any respect. Except for the payment of customary fees, there are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by
the Commitment Letters. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe
that the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
will not be satisfied or that any portion of the Financing to be made
thereunder will not otherwise be made available to Parent or Merger Sub on
the Closing Date. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent under the
Commitment Letters. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid as of the date
hereof and shall in the future pay any such fees as they become due. Parent
will provide to the Company any amendments to the Commitment Letters or any

(but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours).

with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was
not, directly or indirectly, the result of a breach of this _Section 5.5_ ,
the Company may, if the Company Board determines in good faith

nationally recognized reputation) that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable

with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement and containing a standstill agreement; provided
that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board of, this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose to recommend, adopt or approve, any
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in and as permitted by _Section 5.5(a)_
) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or which is intended to or which could
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, termination or failure
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or

        

Section 5.5(b) and (c), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement
by the Required Company Stockholders, the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change(and not solicit proxies) in response to a
Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law; provided, however, that (i) no such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change may be made if the Company failed to comply with this _Section 5.5_ ,
(ii) no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made until after
the third (3rd) Business Day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice (a
" _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from the Company advising Parent that
the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and a new three (3) Business Day period) and representing that
the Company has complied with this _Section 5.5_ , (iii) during such three
(3) Business Day period, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this
Agreement and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (iv) the
Company shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, prior to
the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, Parent makes a proposal
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) to
be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal.

  

(c) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 5.5_ , promptly on the date
of receipt thereof (and in any event, within 24 hours), the Company shall
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or any
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect
to any Takeover Proposal and the terms and conditions of such request,
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations (including the
identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal) and the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the
Person or group making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry or with
whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees
that it shall timely keep Parent fully informed of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent timely and fully informed as to the
details of any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to
the details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any
such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry.  In any event, the Company shall
within 24 hours notify Parent orally and in writing of the occurrence and
substance of any material developments, discussions and negotiations or
material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto and will within
24 hours notify Parent orally and in writing of any determination by the
Company Board that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company or the Company

        

Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by _Section 5.5(b)_.

  

 **SECTION 5.6** Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including _Section 5.6(b)_ , each of the parties hereto will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as practicable and to ensure
that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied, insofar as such
matters are within the control of any of them, including, but not limited to,
obtaining all material consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, approvals, orders and authorizations as are necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such material consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, approvals, orders and
authorizations, including (i) making the requisite filings pursuant to the
HSR Act, (ii) making all necessary notifications required by and filing all
necessary applications with the FCC seeking the consent of the FCC to the
transfer or assignment of the Permits and Communications Licenses issued by
the FCC to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _FCC
Consents_ ") and (iii) making all necessary notifications required by and
filing all necessary applications with the State PUCs seeking the consent of
the applicable State PUC to the transfer or assignment of the Permits and
Communications Licenses issued or granted by such State PUC to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _State PUC Consents_ ");
and (iv) making all necessary notifications required by and filing all
necessary applications with each Municipal Franchising Authority seeking the
consent of the Municipal Franchising Authority to the transfer or assignment
of the Permits and Communications Licenses issued by the
Municipal Franchising Authority to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Municipal Franchising Authority Consents_ ").  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to _Section 5.2_ , the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
each furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing. The Company shall defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed.

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make or
cause to be made the applications or filings required to be made by Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries under or with respect to
the HSR Act or with respect to the FCC Consents, PUC Consents, and Municipal
Franchising Authority Consents, and to pay any fees due of it in connection
with such applications or filings, within 20 Business Days after the date
hereof, and (ii) comply as expeditiously as practicable with any request
under or with respect to the HSR Act or with respect to the FCC Consents and
PUC Consents for additional information, documents or other

        

materials received from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice, the FCC or any State PUC in connection with such applications or
filings or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall keep the other reasonably informed of
communications from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 5.6_ , Parent shall be under no
obligation to make any divestiture of any asset or agree to any type of
behavioral relief that a Governmental Entity may request if such divestiture
or behavioral relief would reasonably be expected to have a material and
adverse effect on the benefits expected to be derived from the Merger, or
Parent, or if such divestitures or behavioral relief would adversely affect
the ability to obtain the Financing.

  

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain the validity of all Material
Communications Licenses and all other material Communications Licenses and
comply in all material respects with all requirements of the Communications
Licenses and the Laws and the rules and regulations of the FCC and State
PUCs. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable

the validity of any of the Communications Licenses or result in the
revocation, surrender or any adverse modification of, forfeiture of, or
failure to renew under regular terms, any of the Communications Licenses, (b)
prosecute with due diligence any pending applications with respect to the
Communications Licenses, including any renewals thereof, and (c) with respect
to Communications Licenses, make all filings and reports and pay all fees
necessary or reasonably appropriate for the continued operation of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as and when such approvals,
consents, permits, licenses, filings, or reports or other authorizations are
necessary or appropriate.

  

(d) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries, and their respective officers, employees,
agents, consultants and other representatives to reasonably cooperate with
Parent to develop and implement a business integration plan (including with
respect to network integration, customer relationship management and
personnel deployment).

  

(e) Subject to _Section 5.6(b)_ , in case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement shall take or cause to be
taken all such necessary action, including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents, as may be reasonably requested by any
party hereto for such purposes or otherwise to complete or perfect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 **SECTION 5.7** Communications.

  

The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to Parent and the
Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be
required by Law, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement

        

shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other
party before making any such public announcements. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall cooperate in good faith with Parent to
develop the CompanyÂ’s communications strategy with respect to the Merger and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including communications to
employees, customers and suppliers (including the first announcement to
those Persons). Cooperation shall include providing Parent with
communication materials (whether to be distributed via email, voice mail, by
memo or otherwise) reasonably prior to its use and including ParentÂ’s
comments in the communication. The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall communicate publicly, internally and with customers and suppliers in a
manner consistent with the mutually developed communication strategy.

  

 **SECTION 5.8** Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

(a) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors and officers of the Company ("
_Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of
the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the CompanyÂ’s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws with any Covered Persons for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Each Covered
Person shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense
of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any
matters subject to indemnification hereunder in accordance with the
CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws in existence on the date
of this Agreement, provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced
undertakes, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advanced
expenses if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

  

(b) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a four-year
"tail" prepaid directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy in respect
of facts or events which occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided
that the premium for such policy are reasonably acceptable to Parent (it
being understood that a policy with a one-time premium not in excess of 300%
of the current annual premium shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable to
Parent).

  

(c) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee to whom this
_Section 5.8_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.8_ apply
and their respective heirs, successors and assigns shall be express third-
party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_ ).  In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 **SECTION 5.9** Fees and Expenses.

  

Except for expenses arising out of the filing of a premerger notification and
report form under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger (which such expenses
shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company) and as otherwise provided
in _Section 7.3_ , each party hereto shall bear its own fees, costs and
expenses incurred in the pursuit of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the fees and expenses of its respective counsel,
financial advisors and accountants.

  

 **SECTION 5.10** Section 16 Compliance.

  

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be

treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company.

  

 **SECTION 5.11** Supplemental Information.

  

The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt
notice to Company of (i) any written notice or other communication from any
third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, becoming aware of any
facts, matters or circumstances that would cause any condition to the
obligations of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to effect the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied
or (iii) the occurrence or existence of any event which would, or could with
the passage of time or otherwise, make any representation or warranty
contained herein (without giving effect to any exception or qualification
contained therein relating to materiality or a Company Material Adverse
Effect) untrue in any material respect; provided, however, that the delivery
of notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the Company or Parent.  Further, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any Company Material Adverse
Effect or the occurrence of any event or events which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

 **SECTION 5.12** United Communications Acquisition.

  

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate the acquisition of United Communications, Inc. as
contemplated by, and in accordance with the terms of, the Unicomm Acquisition
Agreement. The Company shall not waive any closing condition or amend the

such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

 **SECTION 5.13** State Takeover Statutes.

  

Parent, the Company and their respective board of directors shall (i) take
all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or

        

becomes applicable to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 **SECTION 5.14** Employee Benefits Matters.

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, and for a period of at least one (1) year
thereafter, Parent agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to provide each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees") with
compensation and benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than
those, at ParentÂ’s discretion, provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or as provided to employees on the date of this
Agreement pursuant to Employee Benefit Plans set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule. Nothing in this Section 5.14 shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate any employee. Nothing
contained in this Section 5.14, whether express or implied, (i) shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan,
or (ii) shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Employee Benefit
Plan following the Closing. To the extent that service is relevant for
purposes of eligibility to participate or vesting (but not for any other
purpose) under any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) extended to Affected Employees,
Affected Employees shall receive full credit for their service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. To the extent Parent
does not satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.14(a) by maintaining,
or causing the Surviving Corporation to maintain, Employee Benefit Plans,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its relevant
insurance carrier(s) (i) to waive any preexisting condition limitations and
any eligibility waiting periods with respect to each of the Affected
Employees to the extent such limitations and waiting periods did not apply or
had been satisfied with respect to similar coverage under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii) to recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under any medical or dental plan any
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Affected Employees under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such
Employee Benefit Plan is discontinued.

  

(b) Parent hereby agrees that for a period of one year immediately following
the Effective Time it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide all employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries
who are employed thereby as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than employees who, as of the Effective Time, are party to severance
agreements identified in _Section 5.14(b)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule_ )
who are Terminated Without Cause with a minimum level of severance benefits
equal to, and calculated in accordance with, the severance policy set forth
in _Section 5.14(b)(2) to the Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes
of determining the amount of their minimum severance benefits under
this Section 5.14(b), employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall receive credit for all service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the
Effective Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, any current or former Affiliate of the Company or

        

any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor, to the extent previously
recognized under any Employment Benefit Plan). No Affected Employee shall have
any obligation to mitigate the amount of any payments provided for in this
Section 5.14(b) by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the
amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Section 5.14(b) be
reduced by any compensation earned by the Affected Employee as the result of
employment by another employer or self-employment or by retirement benefits.
For purposes of this Section 5.14(b), "Termination Without Cause" will
generally be defined as an Affected EmployeeÂ’s termination of employment by
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries other than for (i) the commission of an act
of fraud, embezzlement or dishonesty by the Affected Employee that has
material adverse impact on the Parent or any successor or Affiliate thereof,
(ii) the Affected EmployeeÂ’s conviction of, or guilty plea or plea of nolo
contendere to, a felony or misdemeanor resulting in a jail sentence or any
crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; (iii) the refusal or failure
by the Affected Employee to substantially perform his or her duties with his
or her employer, after a demand for such performance has been delivered to
the Affected Employee by such employer and such refusal or failure continues
for a period of thirty (30) days following such demand; or (iv)
any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Affected Employee of
confidential information or trade secrets of Parent or any successor or
Affiliate thereof that has a material adverse impact on any such entity.

  

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall terminate each Employee
Benefit Plan that constitutes a "Code Section 401(k) plan" (each such
Employee Benefit Plan, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective prior to the
Closing Date, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to
sponsor and maintain (or cause the Surviving Corporation to sponsor and
maintain) such plan by providing the Company with written notice of such
election not less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that each Company 401(k) Plan with respect
to which Parent has not provided the notice specified in the immediately
preceding sentence (i) has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
CompanyÂ’s or SubsidiaryÂ’s Board of Directors, effective not later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) an executed amendment to
each such Company 401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all
applicable requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder. The form and
substance of such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent.  Parent also agrees that, in the event Parent
requires the Company to terminate any and all Company 401(k) Plans, Parent
shall either (i) allow any Affected Employees who have accounts under the
CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plans to rollover the amounts in such accounts (including
outstanding loans) into ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan or a 401(k) plan of one of
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries or (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to adopt a
401(k) plan and allow any Affected Employees who have accounts under the
CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plans to rollover the amounts in such accounts (including
outstanding loans) into the Surviving CorporationÂ’s 401(k) plan; provided,
however, that neither ParentÂ’s nor any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ 401(k) plan shall
be required to accept such rollover if Parent or such Subsidiary reasonably
determines that the acceptance of any such rollover would reasonably be
expected to jeopardize the qualified status of such plan.

  

(d) To the extent the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent is obligated to make any payment or payments as a
result of the Merger ("Parachute Payments") that would constitute an
"excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Person subject to the excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code an amount necessary to pay such excess tax,
taking into account the taxability of the payment; provided that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in the aggregate for all
Persons, in excess of $900,000.

        

 **SECTION 5.15** Financing.

  

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and
(ii) satisfy or obtain the waiver of all conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub in such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as
soon as reasonably practicable on the same or substantially similar terms.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party of the Commitment Letters or any termination of the Commitment Letters.
 Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment
Letters without first consulting the Company.  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall agree to any amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitments
Letters if such amendment would materially and adversely affect or delay in
any material respect ParentÂ’s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without first obtaining the CompanyÂ’s prior
written consent.

  

(b) The Company shall, to the extent Parent may reasonably request in
connection with any third-party financing Parent and Merger Sub may seek to
obtain in order to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to refinance the existing indebtedness of the Company, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, employees and advisors to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the completion of the Financing,
including: (i) cooperating in the preparation of any offering memorandum,
private placement memorandum, prospectuses or similar documents,
(ii) providing all audited and unaudited financial statements and financial
data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K and of type
and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act to consummate the offering of secured or senior notes, (iii)
making senior management of the Company reasonably available for meetings and
due diligence sessions, (iv) cooperating with prospective lenders,
placement agents, initial purchasers and their respective advisors in
performing their due diligence, (v) entering into customary agreements with
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents and providing and
executing customary closing documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, (vi) entering into or help procure pledge and security documents,
landlord waivers, other definitive financing documents or other requested
certificates or documents, including, without limitation, documents relating
to the release of liens in connection with the CompanyÂ’s existing
indebtedness, (vii) providing reasonable assistance with respect to obtaining
a customary certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters, and (viii) obtaining customary comfort letters
of accountants, audit reports, legal opinions and real estate
title documentation as may be reasonably requested by Parent; provided that
none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment
or similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with any
such third-party financing prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company Board to take
any action to approve any third party financing provided in connection with
the Merger.

        

 **SECTION 5.16** Resignations.

  

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors
and officers of the Company or any Subsidiary designated by Parent to the
Company in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing;
provided that such resignation shall be structured to preserve, or not waive,
the rights of any such director or officer of his or her rights under any
written severance or change of control agreement in effect as of the date of
this Agreement and set forth in _Section 3.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_.

  

 **SECTION 5.17** Environmental Investigation.

  

For 50 days after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall have the right, at
its sole cost and expense, to (a) inspect non-privileged records, reports,
permits, applications, monitoring results, studies, correspondence data and
any other information or documents relevant to the compliance or
noncompliance of the Company and its Subsidiaries with Environmental Laws and
(b) conduct or have conducted environmental audits regarding the facilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and conduct tests of the soil surface or
subsurface waters and air quality at, in, on, beneath or about the facilities
of the Company, and to conduct such other procedures, in each case, as may be
reasonably recommended by an environmental consultant engaged by Parent based
on its professional judgment, in a manner consistent with good engineering
practice; provided that Parent, with the reasonable assistance of Company,
shall seek and obtain appropriate permission to conduct such tests on third-
party property; provided that in each case, such tests and inspections shall
be conducted only (i) during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice to the Company and any relevant third-party and (ii) in a manner that
will not materially interfere with the operation of the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and/or the use of, access to or egress from the
facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries. If after the forging inspection
or audit, an environmental consultant engaged by Parent based on its
professional judgment, in a manner consistent with good engineering practice,
reasonably recommends further inspection or audit, Parent shall have an
additional 30 days to conduct such further investigation or audit. In any
event, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed as to any material
results of the investigations that may reasonably likely indicate that the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(f) would not to be satisfied, and shall,
at the request of the Company, meet with the Company at or prior to 30 days
from the date of this Agreement to provide the status of Parent\'s
investigation.

respective Affiliates shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the

 **SECTION 7.3** Termination Fees.

  

(a) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to:

  

(i) _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ , _7.1(b)(ii)_ , or _7.1(d)(i)_ and (x) at any time
after the date hereof and before such termination a Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Company Board
and (y) within nine (9) months of the termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect
to a Takeover Proposal or any such transaction involving a Takeover Proposal
is consummated; or

  

(ii) _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _7.1(d)(ii)_  hereof,

  

then the Company shall (1) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i)
of this _Section 7.3(a)_ , upon the earlier to occur of the execution of such
definitive agreement and such consummation, (2) in the case of termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ , not later than the close of business on
the Business Day following such termination or (3) in the case of termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, on the date of termination, pay Parent a
non-refundable fee in an amount equal to $16,770,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing to the Company by Parent. For purposes of

        

this paragraph (a), " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in _Section 9.1_, except that all references to "20%" shall be
changed to "50%."

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated under any of the circumstances described
in _Section 7.3(a)_ (but with respect to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ , without regard
to whether any of the circumstances described in clause (y) thereof
have occurred), the Company shall reimburse Parent for all its fees and
expenses, not to exceed $2,000,000 (including attorneyÂ’s fees) incurred in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company

by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing to the Company by Parent, not later than the close of business on the
fifth Business Day following such termination.

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ , then Parent shall pay the Company a
non-refundable fee in an amount equal to $16,770,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing to Parent by the Company. The
Company Termination Fee shall be paid promptly as possible (but in any event
within two Business Days) following such termination by the Company.

  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Co acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements
the Company, Parent and Merger Co would not have entered into this Agreement,
and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 do not constitute a
penalty. If the Company fails to pay as directed in writing by Parent any
amounts due to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 7.3 within the
time periods specified in this Section 7.3 or Parent fails to pay the Company
any amounts due to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3 within the time
periods specified in this Section 7.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall pay the actual and reasonably documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual
payment.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the CompanyÂ’s
right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee from Parent pursuant
to this Section 7.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and stockholders against Parent, Merger Sub, and any of
their respective stockholders, directors, employees, officers, Affiliates or
agents for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for any claims or actions
arising out of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or the
termination or failure to perform under this Agreement, and the CompanyÂ’s
only right shall be to receive the Company Termination Fee as set forth
above.
