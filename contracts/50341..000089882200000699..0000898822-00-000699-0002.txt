the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island and the certificate of
merger (together with the Articles of Merger, the "Certificate of Merger") that

herein as "Trust Account Shares") and other than any shares of Summit Common
Stock held by Summit or FleetBoston in respect of a debt previously contracted
(any such shares of Summit Common Stock, and shares of FleetBoston Common Stock
which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Summit or

right to receive FleetBoston Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to

shares into which the shares of Summit Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e).
Certificates previously representing shares of Summit Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of FleetBoston Common Stock

securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in

                                   ARTICLE II


                               EXCHANGE OF SHARES

            2.1  FleetBoston to Make Shares Available. At or prior to the
Effective Time, FleetBoston shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
a bank or trust company Subsidiary of FleetBoston, or another bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to each of Summit and FleetBoston (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of
FleetBoston Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash
and certificates for shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Summit Common Stock.

            2.2  Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than 10 days after the later of the Closing
Date or the date the Exchange Agent shall have received from Summit a
substantially complete list of the final shareholders of Summit as of the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of one or
more Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed
to by the parties (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of Summit Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange
and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of FleetBoston Common
Stock to which such holder of Summit Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Article I, (ii) a check representing the amount of
any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and (iii) a check representing the amount of any
dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i) and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall




                                      -5-


<PAGE>


forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates.

            (b)  No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
FleetBoston Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable and (ii), at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender, with respect to shares of FleetBoston Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

            (c)  If any certificate representing shares of FleetBoston Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of FleetBoston Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

            (d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Summit of the shares of Summit Capital Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Summit Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time and otherwise as necessary to prepare a list of the final shareholders of
Summit. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of FleetBoston Common Stock as
provided in this Article II.

            (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of FleetBoston Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to FleetBoston Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
FleetBoston. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, FleetBoston
shall pay to each former stockholder of Summit who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i)
the average of the closing-sale prices of FleetBoston Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") as reported by The Wall Street Journal
for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time
by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when




                                      -6-


<PAGE>


expressed in decimal form) of FleetBoston Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

            (f)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Summit for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be paid to
FleetBoston. Any former stockholders of Summit who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to FleetBoston for payment of
the shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the FleetBoston Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Summit Common Stock, as the case may be,
such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
FleetBoston, Summit, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Summit Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

            (g)  In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
FleetBoston, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as FleetBoston
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
FleetBoston Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE III

has duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax

been adequately reserved against or (ii) information returns, Tax returns, Taxes
or other governmental charges as to which the failure to file, pay or make
provision for will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material

for employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by Summit or any of its

would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Summit.

            3.12 Employees. (a) The Summit Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each material employee or director benefit or compensation
plan, arrangement or agreement, and any material bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment,

maintained, or contributed to, as of the date of this Agreement (the "Summit
Benefit Plans") by Summit, any of its Subsidiaries or by any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated (a "Summit ERISA Affiliate"), all of which together
with Summit would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
4001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA").

            (b)  Summit has heretofore made available to FleetBoston true and

including, but not limited to, (i) the actuarial report for such Summit Benefit
Plan (if applicable) for each of the last two years and (ii) the most recent
determination letter from the IRS (if applicable) for such Summit Benefit Plan.

            (c)  Except for such noncompliance as would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Summit, (i) each of Summit Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in compliance with applicable laws,
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, (ii) each of Summit Benefit
Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401 (a) of the
Code is so qualified, and there are no existing circumstances or any events that
have occurred that will adversely affect the qualified status of any such Summit
Benefit Plan, (iii) with respect to each Summit Benefit Plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, the present value (as defined under Section 3(26) of ERISA)
of accumulated benefit obligations under such Summit Benefit Plan, based upon
the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by such Summit Benefit Plan's actuary with respect to such
Summit Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then
current value (as defined under Section 3(26) of ERISA) of the assets of such
Summit Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no Summit Benefit
Plan provides benefits coverage, including, without limitation, death or medical

employees or directors of Summit or its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, other than (A) coverage mandated by applicable
law, (B) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (C)




                                      -14-

ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to Summit, its Subsidiaries or any Summit ERISA
Affiliate of incurring a liability thereunder, (vi) no Summit Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA), (vii) none of Summit, its Subsidiaries or any other person, including
any fiduciary, has engaged in a transaction in connection with which Summit, its
Subsidiaries or any Summit Benefit Plan will be subject to either a material
civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material
Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, and (viii) to the best
knowledge of Summit there are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of
Summit Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto that will have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Summit.

            (d)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of Summit or any of its
affiliates from Summit or any of its affiliates under any Summit Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Summit Benefit
Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits.

            3.13 SEC Reports. Summit has previously made available to
FleetBoston an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
since January 1, 1997 by Summit with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act (the "Summit
Reports") and prior to the date hereof and (b) communication mailed by Summit to
its stockholders since January 1, 1997 and prior to the date hereof, and no such
Summit Report or communication, as of the date thereof, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that
information as of a later date (but before the date hereof) shall be deemed to
modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 1997, as of their
respective dates, all Summit Reports filed under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

            3.14 Compliance with Applicable Law. (a) Summit and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary




                                      -15-


<PAGE>


for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to
each, and have complied in all material respects with and are not in default in
any material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
Summit or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such
license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default
will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Summit.

            (b)  Except as will not have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Summit, Summit and each Summit
Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor,
in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and
federal law and regulation and common law. None of Summit, any Summit
Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of Summit or of any Summit
Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary
account that will have a Material Adverse Effect on Summit, and the accountings
for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material respects
and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

            3.15 Certain Contracts. (a) Neither Summit nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of
any directors, officers or employees, other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the consummation or
stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from
FleetBoston, Summit, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or
incorporated by reference in Summit Reports, (iv) which materially restricts the
conduct of any line of business by Summit or upon consummation of the Merger
will materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in
any line of business in which a bank holding company may lawfully engage, (v)
with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining
agreement) or (vi) (including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights
plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan) any of the benefits of which
will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated,
by the occurrence of any stockholder approval or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits
of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Summit has previously made available to FleetBoston true and
correct copies of all employment and deferred compensation agreements which are
in writing and to which Summit or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 3.14(a), whether or not set forth in Summit Disclosure Schedule, is
referred to herein as a "Summit Contract," and neither Summit nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of, or has received




                                      -16-


<PAGE>


notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which,
either individually or in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on
Summit.

            (b)  With such exceptions that, either individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Summit, (i) each Summit
Contract is valid and binding on Summit or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and is in full force and effect, (ii) Summit and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required to
be performed by it to date under each Summit Contract, and (iii) no event or
condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
will constitute, a material default on the part of Summit or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such Summit Contract.

            3.16 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither Summit nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or
has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
1997, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 1997, has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently
restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any
material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends,
its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business (each
item in this sentence, whether or not set forth in Summit Disclosure Schedule, a
"Summit Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Summit or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 1997, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any
such Summit Regulatory Agreement.

            3.17 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate
swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk
management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of Summit or for
the account of a customer of Summit or any of its Subsidiaries, were entered
into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, to
Summit's knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable
rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal,
valid and binding obligations of Summit or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable
in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies), and are in full
force and effect. Summit and each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all
material respects all of their material obligations thereunder to the extent
that such obligations to perform have accrued; and, to Summit's knowledge, there
are no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.

            3.18 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Summit
included in Summit 1999 10-K and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 1999, since such
date, neither Summit




                                      -17-


<PAGE>


nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become
due) that, either individually or in the aggregate (including if considered
together with liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since December 31, 1999), has had or will have a Material
Adverse Effect on Summit.

            3.19 Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result
in the imposition, on Summit of any liability or obligation arising under common
law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or
threatened against Summit, which liability or obligation will, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Summit. To
the knowledge of Summit, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or
obligation that will, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Summit. Summit is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment,
decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority or third
party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that
will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Summit.

            3.20 Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Summit, to the knowledge of
Summit: (a) Summit and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use (in
each case, free and clear of any liens), all Intellectual Property (as defined
below) used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted; (b) the use of any Intellectual Property by Summit and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person
and is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Summit or any
Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property; (c) no Person is
challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of Summit or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or
licensed to Summit or its Subsidiaries; and (d) neither Summit nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending claim with respect
to any Intellectual Property used by Summit and its Subsidiaries and no
Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Summit or its Subsidiaries is
being used or enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean trademarks, service marks,
brand names, certification marks, trade dress and other indications of origin,
the goodwill associated with the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction
of, and applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including
any extension, modification or renewal of any such registration or application;
inventions, discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not, in any
jurisdiction; patents, applications for patents (including, without limitation,
divisions, continuations, continuations in part and renewal applications), and
any renewals, extensions or reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; nonpublic
information, trade secrets and




                                      -18-


<PAGE>


confidential information and rights in any jurisdiction to limit the use or
disclosure thereof by any person; writings and other works, whether
copyrightable or not, in any jurisdiction; and registrations or applications for
registration of copyrights in any jurisdiction, and any renewals or extensions
thereof; any similar intellectual property or proprietary rights.

            3.21 State Takeover Laws; Summit Rights Agreement. (a) The Board of
Directors of Summit has approved this Agreement and Summit Option Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for purposes of rendering
inapplicable to such agreements and transactions the New Jersey Shareholder
Protection Act, Summit Rights Agreement and, to the best knowledge of Summit,
any similar "takeover" or "interested stockholder" law (all such laws, including
the New Jersey Shareholder Protection Act, "Takeover Statutes").

            (b)  Summit has taken all action, if any, necessary or appropriate
so that the entering into of this Agreement and Summit Option Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will
not result in the ability of any person to exercise any Summit Stockholder
Rights under Summit Rights Agreement or enable or require Summit Stockholder
Rights to separate from the shares of Summit Common Stock to which they are
attached or to be triggered or become exercisable. No "Distribution Date" or
"Stock Acquisition Date" (as such terms are defined in Summit Rights Agreement)
has occurred.

            3.22 Reorganization; Pooling of Interests. As of the date of this
Agreement, Summit has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and as a
"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

            3.23 Opinions. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Summit has
received an opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith to the effect
that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth
therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the stockholders of Summit from a
financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of
the date of this Agreement.

            3.24 Summit Information. The information relating to Summit and its
Subsidiaries which is provided by Summit or its representatives for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document filed with any other
Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate
only to FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(viii) such filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under
the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with the
issuance of the shares of FleetBoston Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement,
no consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental
Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by
FleetBoston of this Agreement and (B) the consummation by FleetBoston of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

            4.5  Reports. FleetBoston and each of its Subsidiaries have timely
filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since
January 1, 1997 with the Regulatory Agencies, and all other reports and
statements required to be filed by them since January 1, 1997, including,
without limitation, any report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the
laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity
or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on
FleetBoston. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in
the ordinary course of the business of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the best
knowledge of FleetBoston, investigation into the business or operations of
FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 1997, except where such
proceedings or investigation will not have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. There (i) is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any
report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of FleetBoston
or any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) has been no formal or informal inquiries
by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of FleetBoston since January 1,
1997, which, in the reasonable judgment of FleetBoston, will have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

            4.6  Financial Statements. FleetBoston has previously provided to
Summit copies of (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of FleetBoston and
its Subsidiaries as of December 31, for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and the
related audited consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the fiscal years 1997 through 1999, inclusive (the
"FleetBoston 1999 Financial Information"), as reported in FleetBoston's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 (the
"FleetBoston 1999 10-K") filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, accompanied
by the audit report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public
accountants with respect to FleetBoston and (ii) the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of Summit and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity
and cash flows of the six month periods then ended, as reported in Summit
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 30, 2000. The
December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet of FleetBoston (including the
related notes, where applicable) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated




                                      -23-


<PAGE>


financial position of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof,
and the other financial statements referred to in this Section 4.6 (including
the related notes, where applicable) fairly present in all material respects the
results of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders' equity and
consolidated financial position of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth,
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in amounts consistent with past
experience in the case of unaudited statements; each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) complies in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP
and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions.

            4.7  Broker's Fees. Neither FleetBoston nor any FleetBoston
Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

            4.8  Absence of Certain Changes or Events. (a) Except as publicly
disclosed in FleetBoston Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since December
31, 1999, no event or events have occurred which has had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

            (b)  Except as publicly disclosed in FleetBoston Reports filed prior
to the date hereof, from December 31, 1999 through and including the date
hereof, FleetBoston and the FleetBoston Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respect in the ordinary course.

            4.9  Legal Proceedings. (a) Neither FleetBoston nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of
FleetBoston's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any
nature against FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the
validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to
which, in any such case, there is a reasonable probability of an adverse
determination and which, if adversely determined, will have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

            (b)  There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction
(other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated bank
holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon FleetBoston, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries that has
had or will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on FleetBoston or the Surviving Corporation.

            4.10 Taxes and Tax Returns. Each of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries
has duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax
returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof (all such
returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid
or made provision for the payment of all Taxes and other governmental charges
which have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal,
state, foreign or local taxing authorities (including, without limitation, if
and to the extent applicable, those due in respect of its properties, income,
business, capital stock, deposits, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls)
other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges which are not yet delinquent
or are being contested in good faith and have not been finally determined, or
(ii) information returns, tax returns, Taxes or other governmental charges as to
which the failure to file, pay or make provision for will not have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. The
federal income Tax returns of FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries have been
examined by the IRS through 1990 and any liability with respect thereto has been
satisfied or any liability with respect to deficiencies asserted as a result of
such examination is covered by adequate reserves. There are no material disputes
pending, or claims asserted for, Taxes or assessments upon FleetBoston or any of
its Subsidiaries for which FleetBoston does not have adequate reserves. Neither
FleetBoston nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such
an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among FleetBoston and its
Subsidiaries). Within the past five years, neither FleetBoston nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.

            (b)  No disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code
for employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by FleetBoston or any of
its Subsidiaries under any contract, plan, program, arrangement or understanding
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

            4.11 SEC Reports. FleetBoston has previously made available to
Summit an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since January
1, 1997 by FleetBoston with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (the "FleetBoston Reports") and prior to the date hereof and (b)
communication mailed by FleetBoston to its stockholders since January 1, 1997
and prior to the date hereof, and no such FleetBoston Report or communication,
as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but
before the date hereof) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. Since January 1, 1997, as of their respective dates, all FleetBoston
Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto.

            4.12 Compliance with Applicable Law. (a) FleetBoston and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and
pursuant to each, and have complied in all material respects with and are not in
default in any material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such
license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default
will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on FleetBoston.

            (b)  Except as will not have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston, FleetBoston and each
FleetBoston Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts
as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor,
in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable state and
federal law and regulation and common law. None of FleetBoston, any FleetBoston
Subsidiary, or any director, officer or employee of FleetBoston or of any
FleetBoston Subsidiary, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any
such fiduciary account that will have a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston,
and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all
material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

            4.13 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither FleetBoston nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or
has been since January 1, 1997, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or
has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or since January 1, 1997,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request of any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any
material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or
risk management policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not
set forth in the FleetBoston Disclosure Schedule, a "FleetBoston Regulatory
Agreement"), nor has FleetBoston or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since
January 1, 1997, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it
is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such FleetBoston
Regulatory Agreement.

            4.14 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate
swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate risk
management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of FleetBoston or
for the account of a customer of FleetBoston or one of its Subsidiaries, were
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and, to FleetBoston's knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and
applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are legal,
valid and binding obligations of FleetBoston or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited




                                      -26-


<PAGE>


by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),
and are in full force and effect. FleetBoston and each of its Subsidiaries have
duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to
FleetBoston's knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults
or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

            4.15 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those liabilities that are
fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
FleetBoston included in the FleetBoston 1999 Financial Information and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 1999, since such date, neither FleetBoston nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
that, either individually or in the aggregate (including if considered together
with liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since December 31, 1999), has had or will have, a Material Adverse
Effect on FleetBoston.

            4.16 Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result
in the imposition, on FleetBoston of any liability or obligation arising under
common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
pending or threatened against FleetBoston, which liability or obligation will,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Summit. To the knowledge of FleetBoston, there is no reasonable basis for any
such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose
any liability or obligation that will, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston. FleetBoston is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
Governmental Authority or third party imposing any liability or obligation with
respect to the foregoing that will have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FleetBoston.

            4.17 Reorganization; Pooling of Interests. As of the date of this
Agreement, FleetBoston has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and as a
"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

            4.18 FleetBoston Information. The information relating to
FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement and the
S-4, or the information relating to FleetBoston and its Subsidiaries that is
provided by FleetBoston or its representatives for inclusion in any other
document filed with any other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement




                                      -27-


<PAGE>


(except for such portions thereof that relate only to Summit or any of its
Subsidiaries) will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. The S-4 will comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

            (c)  FleetBoston and Summit shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of FleetBoston,
Summit or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            (d)  FleetBoston and Summit shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

            6.2  Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the parties shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,

requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other
than reports or documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. None of the
parties nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto
will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

            (b)  Except as provided in Section 9.9, each party to this Agreement
shall hold, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants and advisors

administrative process or, based on the advice of its counsel, by other
requirement of law or any relevant stock exchange, all non-public records,
books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other data and information
(collectively, and including any copies thereof and any reports, analyses,
compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents prepared by the Receiving
Party, "Information") concerning the other party furnished to it (the "Receiving
Party") by the other party or its representatives in connection with entering
into this Agreement or in fulfilling its obligations hereunder, and no Receiving
Party shall release or disclose such Information to any other person, except its
auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers, other consultants and advisors
and, to the extent permitted above, to any Governmental




                                      -33-


<PAGE>


Entity or use such information other than in connection with this Agreement (in
all cases except to the extent the Receiving Party can demonstrate that such
Information or applicable portion thereof (i) is or has become generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure directly or
indirectly by the Receiving Party or its representatives, (ii) was already known
to such party prior to receipt from the other party or its representatives and
were not made known to the Receiving Party by a source that was then prohibited
from disclosing such information, or (iii) becomes available on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Receiving Party or its
representatives provided that such source was not then known by the Receiving
Party to be prohibited from disclosing such information). In the event of a
termination of this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement shall upon request
by the party providing the Information destroy or return to the party providing
the Information all Information, as well as all copies and translations thereof,
provided by the other party or any of its representatives; provided, however,
that upon such request, the Receiving Party may at its option chose not to
return, and shall instead destroy (and certify such destruction by an authorized
officer of the Receiving Party), any reports, analyses, compilations, forecasts,
studies or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party constituting
"Information."

            (c)  No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set
forth herein.

            6.3  Summit Stockholder Approval. Summit shall call a meeting of its
stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
voting upon the requisite stockholder approvals required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger. The Board of Directors of Summit shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Summit the vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement required by the NJBCA and Summit
Certificate and By-Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that the Board of Directors of Summit may withdraw its recommendation
of the Agreement and the Merger if the Board of Directors of Summit determines,
in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

            6.4  Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of FleetBoston and Summit
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts
(a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or
its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be
obtained by Summit or FleetBoston or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

benefits to be provided to employees of Summit and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time ("Covered Employees") shall be substantially the same benefit
plans and programs provided by Summit or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
to such employees as of the date hereof. From and after December 31, 2001, the

accordance with their terms and honor all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees of Summit and its Subsidiaries under Summit Plans
or the applicable contractual commitment, (ii) provide Covered Employees credit
for the most recent period of uninterrupted service (including any bridging or
prior service credit, without regard to whether there has been an interruption
in service, solely to the extent provided by Summit and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof) with Summit or any of its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors)
prior to the Effective Time under employee benefit plans of FleetBoston or its
Subsidiaries (other than FleetBoston's noncontributory cash balance defined
benefit pension plan), (iii) cause any and all pre-existing condition
limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing
condition under comparable Summit Plans) and eligibility waiting periods under
group health plans of FleetBoston to be waived with respect to Covered Employees
(and their eligible dependents) who become participants in such group health
plans and (iv) assume, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to assume, all
contracts and agreements with employees of Summit, which agreements were entered
into prior to the date hereof and which are listed on Section 5.2 of Summit
Disclosure Schedule, and all obligations thereunder. From and after the

12-month anniversary thereof shall be entitled to receive the greater of (i) the
severance payments and benefits under the applicable Summit severance plan or
policy as in effect on the date hereof (without amendment on or after the
Effective Time) and (ii) the severance payments and benefits under FleetBoston's
severance plan or policy as in effect on the date of termination of such Covered
Employee. In addition, FleetBoston will comply with Section 6.7 of Summit
Disclosure Schedule.

            (b)  Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted as preventing
the Surviving Corporation or FleetBoston from amending, modifying or terminating
any FleetBoston Benefit Plans or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or
understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

            6.8  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) In the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which
any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or
employee of Summit or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of Summit or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this
Agreement, Summit Option Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts
to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after
the Effective Time, FleetBoston shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent provided by applicable law, Summit Certificate, Summit By-Laws
and any agreement set forth in Section 6.8 of Summit Disclosure Schedule, each
such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses incurred in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation
to each Indemnified Party as provided by Summit Certificate, Summit By-Laws and
any agreement set forth in Section 6.8 of Summit Disclosure Schedule),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

            (b)  FleetBoston shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
individuals serving as officers and directors of Summit or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy maintained by Summit (provided that FleetBoston may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such;
provided that in no event shall FleetBoston be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Summit
(which current amount is set forth in Section 6.8 of Summit Disclosure Schedule)
for such insurance




                                      -36-


<PAGE>


(the "Insurance Amount), and provided further that if FleetBoston is unable to
maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding
proviso, FleetBoston shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

            (c)  The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

            6.9  Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary
of FleetBoston, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Summit, on the other) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, FleetBoston.

            6.10 Advice of Changes. FleetBoston and Summit shall each promptly
advise the other party of any change or event (i) having a Material Adverse
Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants contained herein.

            6.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of
FleetBoston and Summit shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of FleetBoston Common Stock and Summit Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Summit Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to
their shares of Summit Common Stock and any shares of FleetBoston Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

            6.12 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Assuming that
Summit delivers to FleetBoston the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in
a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of FleetBoston, or a committee of
Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the
receipt by Summit Insiders of FleetBoston Common Stock in exchange for shares of
Summit Common Stock, and of options on FleetBoston Common Stock upon conversion
of options on Summit Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section
16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information
accurate in all respects regarding Summit Insiders, the number of shares of
Summit Common Stock held by each such Summit Insider and expected to be
exchanged for FleetBoston Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and
description of the options on Summit Common Stock held by each such Summit

members and to appoint Mr. T. Joseph Semrod and one of the current outside
directors of Summit Board of Directors (to be mutually agreed upon by
FleetBoston and Summit) to the class of FleetBoston directors with terms
expiring at the 2004 Annual Meeting of FleetBoston Stockholders.

            6.14 Aggregate Capitalization. Summit will not take any action, or
fail to take any action, that results in the aggregate number of shares of
Summit Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including all shares of Summit Common Stock subject to Summit Rights other than
Summit Option Agreement, but not including shares of Summit Common Stock held in
treasury) exceeding 186,365,926.

            6.15 Community Commitments. From and after the Effective Time,
FleetBoston shall use its reasonable efforts to continue the community

the communities currently served by such banks.

to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Summit:

            (a)  by mutual consent of FleetBoston and Summit in a written

enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

<PAGE>


            (c)  by either FleetBoston or Summit if the approval of Summit's
stockholders required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the meeting of
Summit stockholders contemplated by Section 6.3, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

            (d)  by either the Board of Directors of FleetBoston or the Board of
Directors of Summit if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before
the first anniversary of the date hereof unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein; or

            (e)  by either the Board of Directors of FleetBoston or the Board of
Directors of Summit (provided that the terminating party is not then in breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
Summit, in the case of a termination by FleetBoston, or FleetBoston, in the case
of a termination by Summit, which breach, either individually or in the
aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be,
and which is not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party
committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the
Closing Date.

            8.2  Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either FleetBoston or Summit as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of

            8.4  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however,
that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by

or any portion thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form of the
consideration to be delivered to the holders of FleetBoston Common Stock
hereunder, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

                                                            Schedule 6.5(a)(1)



              Form of Affiliate Letter Addressed to Summit Bancorp.


Summit Bancorp.
301 Carnegie Center
Princeton, New Jersey  08543

Ladies and Gentlemen:

            I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of FleetBoston Financial Corporation, a Rhode Island corporation
("FleetBoston"), as the term "affiliate" is used in and for purposes of
Accounting Series Releases Nos. 130 and 135, as amended, of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("Commission"). I have been further advised that pursuant to
the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 1, 2000 (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and betweeen FleetBoston and Summit Bancorp., a New
Jersey corporation ("Summit"), Summit shall be merged with and into FleetBoston
(the "Merger") and each share of the common stock, par value $0.80 per share, of
Summit ("Summit Common Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive 1.02
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of FleetBoston ("FleetBoston
Common Stock"). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

            I represent to and covenant with Summit that, from the date that is
30 days prior to the Effective Time, I will not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of shares of Summit Common Stock held by me and that I will not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of FleetBoston Common Stock, until
after such time as results covering at least 30 days of combined operations of
FleetBoston and Summit after the Merger have been published by FleetBoston in
the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration statement
filed with the Commission, a report to the Commission on Form 10-K, 10-Q, or
8-K, or any other public filing or announcement which includes the results of at
least 30 days of combined operations as contemplated by and in accordance with
the terms of SEC Accounting Series Release No. 35; provided, however, that this
paragraph shall not prevent me from selling, transferring or disposing of such
number of shares of FleetBoston Common Stock or Summit Common Stock as will not,
in the reasonable judgment of accountants to FleetBoston, interfere with or
prevent the Merger being accounted for as a "pooling of interests," taking into
account the nature, extent and timing of such sale, transfer or disposition and
of similar sales, transfers or dispositions by all affiliates of Summit and all
other affiliates of FleetBoston.

            It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms. It is also understood and agreed that
this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect at
such time as financial results covering at least thirty days of combined
operations following the effective date of the Merger have been published as
contemplated by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting Series
Release No. 35.


<PAGE>


            Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of FleetBoston as described in the first
paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to
any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.


                                          Very truly yours,

                                          By:

                Form of Affiliate Letter Addressed to FleetBoston


FleetBoston Financial Corporation
One Federal Street
Boston, Massachusetts  02110

Ladies and Gentlemen:

            I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Summit, a New Jersey corporation ("Summit"), as the term
"affiliate" is (i) defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"), and/or (ii) used in and for purposes of Accounting Series
Releases Nos. 130 and 135, as amended, of the Commission. I have been further
advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of October 1, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between FleetBoston and
Summit, Summit shall be merged with and into FleetBoston (the "Merger") and each
share of the common stock, par value $0.80 per share, of Summit ("Summit Common
Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive 1.02 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of FleetBoston ("FleetBoston Common Stock").
All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

            I represent, warrant and covenant to FleetBoston that in the event I
receive any FleetBoston Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

     (a)       I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
FleetBoston Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

     (b)       I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of FleetBoston Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Summit.

     (c)       I have been advised that the issuance of FleetBoston Common Stock
to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the
Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of Summit I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Summit and
the distribution by me of FleetBoston Common Stock has not been registered under
the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of FleetBoston Common
Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to FleetBoston, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.




<PAGE>


     (d)       I understand that FleetBoston is under no obligation to register
the sale, transfer or other disposition of FleetBoston Common Stock by me or on
my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

     (e)       I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given
to FleetBoston's transfer agents with respect to FleetBoston Common Stock and
that there will be placed on the certificates for FleetBoston Common Stock
issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

            "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
            a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
            of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
            compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
            registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
            registration."

     (f)       I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my
FleetBoston Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, FleetBoston reserves the right to
put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

            "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
            under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
            received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
            under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
            acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
            connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
            Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
            transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
            registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

            It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs
(e) and (f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to FleetBoston a
copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the Act.

            I further represent to and covenant with FleetBoston that, from the
date that is 30 days prior to the Effective Time, I will not sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of shares of Summit Common Stock held by me and that I will
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of FleetBoston Common
Stock received by me in the Merger, until after such time as results covering at
least 30 days of combined operations of FleetBoston and Summitafter the Merger
have been published by FleetBoston, in the form of a quarterly earnings report,
an effective registration statement filed with the Commission, a report to the
Commission on Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K, or any other public filing or announcement




                                      -4-


<PAGE>


which includes the results of at least 30 days of combined operations; provided,
however, that this paragraph shall not prevent me from selling, transferring or
disposing of such number of shares of Summit Common Stock or FleetBoston Common
Stock as will not, in the reasonable judgment of accountants to FleetBoston,
interfere with or prevent the Merger being accounted for as a "pooling of
interests," taking into account the nature, extent and timing of such sale,
transfer or disposition and of similar sales, transfers or dispositions by all
other affiliates of Summit and all affiliates of FleetBoston.

            I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to
(i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii)
any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any
similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my
spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities
or of the equity interest.

            It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms. It is also understood and agreed that
this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon
the later of (i) such time as financial results covering at least thirty days of
combined operations following the effective date of the Merger have been
published as contemplated by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting
Series Release No. 35 and (ii) delivery by the undersigned to FleetBoston of a
copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to FleetBoston, or other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to FleetBoston, to the effect that a transfer of the undersigned's
shares of FleetBoston Common Stock will not violate the Act or any of the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

            Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of Summit as described in the first paragraph
of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          By:
