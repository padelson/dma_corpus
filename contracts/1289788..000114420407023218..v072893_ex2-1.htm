Fund are  together referred to hereinafter as the "Escrow Fund."

 

 

(ii) The  Purchaser shall pay the Option Shares Exercise Price to Kenneth C.
Ricci by  wire  transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the
Seller Representative  at or prior to the Subsequent Closing.

 

 

(iii) Kenneth  C. Ricci shall deliver to the Purchaser all of his rights to
the Option  Shares.

 

 

(iv) The  Purchaser or the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and

or the Escrow Agent are  required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state,  local, provincial or foreign Tax Law, or pursuant to
other applicable judgments,  decrees, injunctions or orders, with respect to
the making of such payment.  To  the extent that amounts are so withheld by

for all purposes of this Agreement as  having been paid to the holder of the
Option Shares in respect of whom such  deduction and withholding was made by
the Purchaser or the Escrow  Agent.

**Section  1.5** **_Pre-Closing  Purchase Price Adjustment - Capital
Expenditures_**

 

 

The  Company and its Subsidiaries have incurred from and after January 1,
2007,  and  anticipate incurring from and after the date hereof through the
Closing, certain  budgeted capital expenditures relating to the Business as
set forth on the  attached _FBO  Capital Expenditure Schedule_.  To the 
extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries incur and pay such expenditures 
(other than expenditures related to those projects identified on the  _FBO 
Capital Expenditure Schedule_   as being "discretionary projects") from and
after January 1, 2007 but prior to the  Closing (the "Reimbursable Cap-Ex
Amount") and the documentation set forth in  _Section  7.1(g)(iv)_   is 
provided to the Purchaser prior to Closing to substantiate the Reimbursable 
Cap-Ex Amount, the Initial Closing Shares Purchase Price shall be increased 
pursuant to _Section  1.4(a)(iii)_   by an  amount per share equal to the
quotient of (a) the Reimbursable Cap-Ex Amount  _divided  by_   (b) 
68,785.69.

 

 

**Section  1.6** **_Pre-Closing  Net Working Capital Adjustment_**

 

 

(a) At  least  five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver its  best  estimate of the balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the  Closing (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet")
and a calculation from the  Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated
Net Working Capital  Calculation") of the estimated Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Net Working  Capital"), determined in accordance with the
definition of Net Working Capital  in _Article  VIII_. 

 

 

(b) For  purposes of this Agreement, Target Net Working Capital means
_negative_   Five  Hundred Seventy Thousand Ninety-Four Dollars (-$570,094).

 

 

(c) If  the  Estimated Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net
Working Capital, then  there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
under this _Section  1.6_. 

 

 

(d) To  the  extent that the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the
Target Net Working  Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital Surplus"), then
the Purchase Price shall  be increased pursuant to _Section  1.4(a)(iv)_  
by an  amount per share equal to the quotient of (i) the Estimated Working
Capital  Surplus _divided  by_   (ii)  68,785.69.

 

 

(e) To  the  extent that the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Net Working  Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital Deficiency"),
then the Purchase Price  shall be decreased pursuant to _Section 
1.4(a)(iii)_   by an  amount per share equal to the quotient of (x) the
Estimated Working Capital  Deficiency _divided  by_   (y)  68,785.69.

**Section  1.7** **_Post-Closing  Net Working Capital Adjustment_**

 

 

Following  the Closing Date, the Initial Closing Shares Purchase Price shall
be adjusted,  if at all, as set forth below:

 

 

(a) The  Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative
within  seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date an unaudited balance
sheet of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on
the Closing Date  (the "Proposed Closing Balance Sheet") and a calculation
from the Proposed  Closing Balance Sheet (the "Proposed Net Working Capital
Calculation") of Net  Working Capital (the "Proposed Net Working Capital"),
determined in accordance  with the definition of Net Working Capital in
_Article  VIII_. 

 

 

(b) On  or  prior to the 45th day following the Purchaser's delivery of the
Proposed Closing  Balance Sheet and the Proposed Net Working Capital
Calculation, the Seller  Representative may give the Purchaser a written
notice stating in reasonable  detail the Seller Representative's objections
(an "Objection Notice") to the  Proposed Closing Balance Sheet or the
Proposed Net Working Capital Calculation.  Any Objection Notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the dollar amount of  any  objection and the basis
therefor. Any determination set forth on the Proposed  Closing Balance Sheet
or the Proposed Net Working Capital Calculation which  is  not specifically
objected to in the Objection Notice shall be deemed acceptable  and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties upon delivery of the Objection  Notice. If
the Seller Representative does not give the Purchaser an Objection  Notice
within such 45-day period, then the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet and  the
Proposed Net Working Capital Calculation shall be conclusive and binding 
upon the Parties and the Net Working Capital set forth in the Proposed Net 
Working Capital Calculation will constitute the Net Working Capital for
purposes  of this _Section  1.7_.  During  such 45-day period, the
Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative with  access to the
Company's books and records and its personnel and accountants as  may be
reasonably necessary for the Seller Representative to review the Proposed 
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Net Working Capital  Calculation.

 

 

(c) Following  the Purchaser's receipt of any Objection Notice, the Seller
Representative and  the Purchaser shall attempt to negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute.  In the event that the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser fail to agree  on  any of the Seller Representative's proposed
adjustments set forth in the  Objection Notice within thirty (30) days after
the Purchaser receives the  Objection Notice, the Seller Representative and
the Purchaser agree that a  mutually acceptable accounting firm of nationally
recognized standing (the  "Independent Auditors") shall, within the 45-day
period immediately following  such 30-day period, make the final
determination of the Net Working Capital  in  accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller  Representative each shall
provide the Independent Auditors with their respective  determinations of the
Net Working Capital. The Independent Auditors shall make  an independent
determination of the Net Working Capital that, assuming  compliance with the
previous clause, shall be final and binding on the Sellers  and the Purchaser
if such independent determination shall be within the range  proposed by the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative in the Proposed Net  Working Capital
Calculation and the Objection Notice. If the Independent  Auditors'
determination of the Net Working Capital is outside of the range  proposed by
the Purchaser and the Seller Representative in the Proposed Net  Working
Capital Calculation and the Objection Notice, then the Party whose 
calculation of Net Working Capital was closer to that of the Independent 
Auditors shall be final and binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser. The
fees,  costs and expenses of the Independent Auditors shall be paid by the
party whose  calculation of Net Working Capital was different by the greater
amount from  that  of the Independent Auditors.

(d) The  term "Closing Balance Sheet" shall mean the Proposed Closing
Balance Sheet delivered  pursuant to _Section  1.7(a)_   as  adjusted, if
at all, pursuant to _Sections  1.7(b)_   and _(c)_. 

 

 

(e) Any  payment received by the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 
1.4(a)(iv)_   shall be  held by the Seller Representative until the Net
Working Capital is finally  determined pursuant to this _Section  1.7_. 

 

 

(i) If  the  Estimated Net Working Capital equals the Net Working Capital as
finally  determined pursuant to this _Section  1.7_ ,  then  there shall
be no adjustment to the consideration paid at Closing pursuant  to 
_Section  1.4_. 

 

 

(ii) To  the  extent that the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital  as  finally determined pursuant to this _Section  1.7_  
(the "Final Working Capital Deficiency"), then the Sellers shall be required
to pay  to the Purchaser, within five Business Days after the calculation of
Net Working  Capital becomes binding in accordance with this _Section  1.7_
,  by wire  transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in writing  by  the Purchaser, an amount per share equal to the
quotient of (i) the Final  Working Capital Deficiency _divided  by_  
(ii)  68,785.69 (provided, that, such payment shall be satisfied first from
the  amount, if any, paid to the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 
1.4(a)(iv)_   and if  any amounts remain owing to the Purchaser following
payment of such funds,  then  from the Escrow Fund (but only up to $29.07582
per share) prior to requiring  the  Sellers to make any payment hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the  Purchaser has not purchased the Option
Shares pursuant to the Option Agreement  prior to the determination of the
Final Working Capital Deficiency, any amounts  required to be paid from the
Escrow Fund or by the Sellers as provided above  shall only be paid with
respect to the Initial Closing Shares. If the Purchaser  purchases the Option
Shares pursuant to the Option Agreement after the  determination of the Final
Working Capital Deficiency, any amounts required  to  be paid from the
Escrow Fund or by the Sellers as provided above shall be paid  with respect
to the Option Shares upon the purchase of the Option Shares. 

 

 

(iii) To  the  extent that the Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to this  _Section  1.7_   exceeds  the Estimated Net Working
Capital (the "Final Working Capital Surplus"), then  the Purchaser shall pay
to the Sellers, within five Business Days after the  calculation of Net
Working Capital becomes binding in accordance with this  _Section  1.7_ , 
on a  pro rata basis based upon each Seller's ownership of the Initial
Closing Shares  and the Option Shares immediately prior to the Closing Date,
by wire transfer  of  immediately available funds to the accounts designated
in writing by the Seller  Representative, an amount per share equal to the
quotient of (x) the Final  Working Capital Surplus _divided  by_   (y) 
68,785.69. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Purchaser has not purchased 
the  Option Shares pursuant to the Option Agreement prior to the
determination of  the  Final Working Capital Surplus, any amounts required
to be paid by the Purchaser  as provided above with respect to the Option
Shares shall be paid to the Seller  Representative, who shall deposit such
amounts into an escrow account with  the  Escrow Agent for disbursement to
Kenneth C. Ricci or the Purchaser as provided  below. If the Purchaser
purchases the Option Shares pursuant to the Option  Agreement after the
determination of the Final Working Capital Surplus but  on or  prior to
November 12, 2007, then the Seller Representative shall promptly  disburse
the amounts deposited into escrow pursuant to the immediately preceding 
sentence to Kenneth C. Ricci by wire transfer of immediately available funds 
to  the accounts designated in writing by Kenneth C. Ricci. If the Purchaser
has  not  purchased the Option Shares pursuant to the Option Agreement on or
prior to  November 12, 2007, then the Seller Representative shall promptly
disburse the  amounts deposited into escrow as provided above to the
Purchaser by wire  transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in writing  by  the Purchaser.

(iv) The  amount, if any, retained by the Seller Representative as a result
of any payment  pursuant to _Section  1.4(a)(iv)_   following the payments
required pursuant to _Section  1.7(e)(iii)_   shall be  distributed by the
Seller Representative to the Sellers in the same manner  as  described in
_Section  1.7(e)(iii)_. 

 

 

**Section  1.8** **_Tax  Benefit of Certain Payments_**

 

 

All  payments of the type and nature described in _Section  1.4(a)(ii)_  
above,  any bonus, compensation or similar payments actually made to, or
received by,  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or prior to
the Closing  relating directly or indirectly to the consummation of the
Closing, and any  other transaction-related costs, expenses and fees actually
incurred by the  Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
"Transaction Expenses")  and paid on or prior to the Closing will be deemed
to be paid, for all  accounting and Tax reporting purposes, immediately prior
to the consummation  of  the Closing.  To the  extent that the Transaction
Expenses are entitled to be deducted by the Company  under applicable Tax
laws (the "Company Deductible Transaction Expenses"), then  the  Initial
Closing Shares Purchase Price shall be increased pursuant to  _Section 
1.4(a)(iii)_   by an  amount per share equal to the quotient of (a) twenty 
percent (20%) of the Company Deductible Transaction Expenses, up to a
maximum  of  Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) in the aggregate, _divided 
by_   (b)  68,785.69.

 

 

**Section  1.9** **_Seller  Representative_**

 

 

(a) Allied  Capital Corporation is hereby appointed by each Seller (and their
successors  and  assigns) as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Seller
Representative")  for  each Seller, for and on behalf of such Sellers, (i)
to enter into and perform  the Escrow Agreement, to authorize delivery of
cash from the Escrow Fund in  satisfaction of claims pursuant to this
Agreement, to object to such deliveries,  to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand  arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with  respect to such claims, and
to take all actions necessary or appropriate in  the  reasonable judgment of
the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of  the  foregoing, (ii) to
take any other action expressly delegated to the Seller  Representative under
the other terms of this Agreement and (iii) to execute  any  amendment,
waiver or consent of this Agreement or the Escrow  Agreement.  Any  notice
to any Seller required or permitted under this Agreement may be satisfied  by
notice to the Seller Representative.

 

 

(b) The  Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder  as the Seller Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise  of  reasonable judgment. Sellers shall severally
indemnify the Seller Representative  and hold the Seller Representative
harmless against any loss, liability or  expense incurred without negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on the  part  of the Seller Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the  acceptance or administration of
the Seller Representative's duties hereunder,  including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel retained by  the  Seller Representative.
Any party dealing with the Seller Representative is  entitled to rely on the
actions taken by, and consents and approvals given  by,  the Seller
Representative. A Party shall be entitled to rely on the Seller 
Representative's actions, consents and approvals notwithstanding any
knowledge  of the relying Person. No Person shall have any liability for
relying on the  Seller Representative in the foregoing manner.

(c) Concurrent  with the execution hereof, each of the Initial Closing
Sellers has delivered  to  the Seller Representative certificates
representing such Seller's Initial  Closing Shares, except as provided below,
along with stock powers executed  in  blank, and hereby authorizes the
Seller Representative to transfer such shares  to Purchaser at the Closing
subject to the satisfaction of all of Sellers' conditions to Closing. Each of
the Initial Closing Sellers hereby authorizes  the  Seller Representative to
deliver such certificates to Purchaser in connection  with the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in exchange  for the
contemporaneous payment of the portion of the Initial Closing Shares 
Purchase Price to which such Seller is entitled pursuant to the terms
hereof.  3,013.88 of the Initial Closing Shares owned by Directional Aviation
Group,  LLC  (the "Escrowed DAG Shares") are currently being held by US
Bank, NA, successor  to Wachovia Bank, N.A. pursuant to the Escrowed Shares
Escrow Agreement (the "US  Bank Escrow Agreement") among Wachovia Bank,
N.A., Allied Capital Corporation,  Directional Aviation Group, LLC and
Bluechip Investment Company dated March  17,  2005, as amended on January
27, 2006 to, among other things, add Corporate  Wings-CGF, LLC and Corporate
Wings-Cleveland, LLC as parties thereto. Because  the Escrowed DAG Shares are
being held in escrow to secure certain indemnity  obligations in favor of the
Company and its Subsidiaries until July 27, 2007,  these shares will not be
delivered to the Seller Representative concurrent  with  the execution
hereof. In the event that the Closing has not taken place prior  to  the
release of the Escrowed DAG Shares from escrow and this Agreement has not 
been terminated pursuant to _Section  9.1_ ,  Directional Aviation Group,
LLC hereby authorizes the Seller Representative  to  instruct the escrow
agent under the US Bank Escrow Agreement to deliver the  Escrowed DAG Shares
to the Seller Representative to be held in accordance with  this _Section 
1.9_.  In the  event that the Closing occurs prior to the release of the
Escrowed DAG Shares  from escrow, Directional Aviation Group, LLC hereby
authorizes the Seller  Representative to instruct the escrow agent under the
US Bank Escrow Agreement  to deliver the Escrowed DAG Shares to the
Purchaser. If this Agreement is  terminated pursuant to _Section  9.1_ , 
then  the Seller Representative will be required to return to the respective
Initial  Closing Sellers any stock certificates and stock powers delivered to
the Seller  Representative hereunder by such Initial Closing Sellers.

 

 

(d) If  the  Seller Representative receives a payment from the Purchaser
pursuant to  _Section  1.4(a)(iv)_ ,  the  amount of any such payment
shall be deposited into an escrow account separate  from the Escrow Fund with
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall hold, invest  and disburse the funds
in accordance with the terms and conditions of an escrow  agreement between
the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent. The escrow  agreement will
permit the Seller Representative to instruct the Escrow Agent  to  disburse
the escrow deposit and any investment income earned thereon to the  Sellers
and/or the Purchaser in a manner that will satisfy the Seller 
Representative's obligations under _Section  1.7(e)_   hereof.  Any fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid from the funds deposited  with
the Escrow Agent.

Corporation hereby demands full repayment by the Company of the outstanding 
principal and all accrued and unpaid interest, fees, prepayment premiums and 
penalties, if any, of the Indebtedness described in item 2 on the
_Indebtedness  Schedule_.

airport authorities. All contact with the airport authorities regarding  the
Airport Estoppels will be coordinated through the Company. Purchaser will 
furnish the airport authorities with such evidence and assurances as the
airport  authorities reasonably request regarding the Purchaser's
structure,  organization, creditworthiness, insurance coverage and
operating  experience.

 

 

(d) In  the  event that any airport authority to which an Airport Estoppel
is delivered  pursuant to _Section  5.1(c)_   does not  respond to the
estoppel request within sixty-five (65) days following the  Execution Date,
each such airport authority that is designated as a "Required  Authority" on
the attached _Airport  Estoppel Schedule_   (each,  unless and until
removed from the attached _Airport  Estoppel Schedule_   in  accordance
with this _Section  5.1(d)_ ,  a "Required Authority") shall be
automatically removed as a Required Authority  from the attached _Airport 
Estoppel Schedule_.  In the  event that an airport authority has not
responded to an estoppel request within  forty (40) days following the
Execution Date, the Company shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to
provide the Purchaser and its representatives with access  to such airport
authority to permit the Purchaser an opportunity to obtain  a  response to
the estoppel request within the prescribed 65-day period. In the  event that
any airport authority to which an Airport Estoppel is delivered  pursuant to
_Section  5.1(c)_   advises  the Company or the Purchaser within sixty-five
(65) days following the Execution  Date that: (i) it does not, as a matter of
policy or otherwise, respond to  requests for estoppel or furnish estoppel
letters; or (ii) it does not agree  to  the form of Airport Estoppel for
reasons other than an assertion by such airport  authority of a material
violation or breach of the FBO Lease by the Company  or a  Subsidiary, each
such airport authority that is a Required Authority shall  be  automatically
removed as a Required Authority from the attached _Airport  Estoppel
Schedule_.  The  removal of any Required Authority from the attached
_Airport  Estoppel Schedule_   pursuant  to this _Section 5.1(d)_  is 
referred to as an "Automatic Elimination."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) In  the  event that an Airport Estoppel is not received from any
Required Authority  within ninety-five (95) days following the Execution Date
and such airport  authority has not been subject to an Automatic Elimination
pursuant to  _Section  5.1(d)_ ,  the  Purchaser may on or before the
fifth (5th)  day  following such ninety-fifth (95th)  day  elect to remove
such airport authority from the list of Required Authorities  on  the
attached _Airport  Estoppel Schedule_.  In the  event that the Purchaser
elects not to remove any such airport authority from  the list of Required
Authorities on the attached _Airport  Estoppel Schedule_ ,  the  Seller
Representative may, on or before the tenth (10th)  day  following such
ninety-fifth (95th)  day  after the Execution Date, terminate this Agreement
or extend the estoppel period  with respect to such airport authority for an
additional 30-day period ending  on  the one hundred twentieth-fifth (125th)
day after the Execution Date. In the  event such Airport Estoppel has not
been obtained within one hundred twenty-five  (125) days after the Execution
Date, the Seller Representative may elect to  extend such estoppel period for
an additional thirty (30) days ending on the  one  hundred fifty-fifth
(155th) day after the Execution Date or terminate this  Agreement, unless the
Purchaser waives compliance for purposes of the Closing.  In the event such
Airport Estoppel has not been obtained within one hundred  fifty-five (155)
days after the Execution Date, the Seller Representative may  elect to extend
such estoppel period for up to an additional thirty (30) days  ending on the
one hundred eighty-fifth (185th) day after the Execution Date  or  terminate
this Agreement, unless the Purchaser waives compliance for purposes  of  the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that an Airport 
Estoppel is not received from a Required Authority within one hundred 
twenty-five (125) days after the Execution Date, the Seller Representative 
shall  have the right to designate and remove, subject to the limitation
below, one  such Airport Estoppel from a Required Authority (a "Seller
Elimination") by  providing notice thereof to the Purchaser on or prior to
the one hundred  eighty-fifth (185th) day after the Execution Date. A Seller
Elimination will  only be available with respect to an Airport Estoppel from
any of the Required  Authorities set forth on the attached _Seller 
Elimination Schedule_.  If any  Airport Estoppel has not been obtained from
any Required Authority (excluding  any Required Authority subject to an
Automatic Elimination and any Required  Authority subject to a Seller
Elimination) within one hundred eighty-five (185)  days following the
Execution Date, the Purchaser or the Seller Representative  may terminate
this Agreement.

 

 

(f) In  the  event that any Required Authority responds to the estoppel
request within  sixty-five (65) days following the Execution Date and
indicates that consent  is  required of such Required Authority
(notwithstanding the absence of any consent  requirement in the FBO Lease
between such airport authority and the Company)  in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company  and  the Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly  as
practicable, consent from such Required Authority. These efforts would 
include submitting a consent request in the form requested by the Required 
Authority or, if the Required Authority does not request a particular form, 
in a  form reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative.  If a  Required Authority conditions its consent on making
modifications to the  applicable FBO Lease, the Purchaser will agree to such
modifications as long  as  the modifications do not materially impact the
Business or consolidated  financial results, including as a result of
material obligations to finance  capital expenditures imposed by a Required
Authority. If any consent requested  of a Required Authority is not obtained
from such Required Authority within  ninety-five (95) days following the
Execution Date, the Purchaser may on or  before the fifth (5th)  day 
following such ninety-fifth (95th)  day  elect to remove such airport
authority from the list of Required Authorities  on  the attached _Airport 
Estoppel Schedule_.  In the  event that the Purchaser elects not to remove
any such airport authority from  the list of Required Authorities on the
attached _Airport  Estoppel Schedule_ ,  the  Seller Representative may, on
or before the tenth (10th)  day  following such ninety-fifth (95th)  day 
after the Execution Date, terminate this Agreement or extend the consent
period  with respect to such airport authority for an additional 30-day
period. In  the  event such consent has not been obtained during such
additional 30-day period,  the Seller Representative may elect to extend such
consent period for an  additional thirty (30) days or terminate this
Agreement, unless the Purchaser  waives compliance for purposes of Closing.
In the event such consent has not  been obtained during such additional
30-day period, the Seller Representative  may elect to extend such consent
period for up to an additional thirty (30)  days  or terminate this
Agreement, unless the Purchaser waives compliance for purposes  of the
Closing. If a requested consent has not been obtained from any Required 
Authority within one hundred eighty-five (185) days following the Execution 
Date, the Purchaser or the Seller Representative may terminate this 
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Except  as  expressly provided above, in no event shall the Purchaser,
the Sellers, the  Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to: (i) make any
payments to obtain  any  Airport Estoppel or consent; or (ii) accept or
obtain any change in the terms  of  an FBO Lease to obtain any Airport
Estoppel or consent.

 

 

(h) The  Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the
Purchaser with  obtaining replacement licenses and associated permits, and
any associated  required consents or approvals, in each case, from the
Federal Communications  Commission as of or following the Closing to enable
the Company and the  Subsidiaries to continue to operate the Business
immediately following Closing  insofar as matters related to the Federal
Communications Commission is concerned  in a manner consistent in all
material respects with its operation prior to  Closing, which efforts shall
include providing the Purchaser with information  about the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be required for such licenses,  permits, consents or
approvals.

shall not  preclude the Company or any Subsidiary from amending or modifying

**Section  5.3** **_Access  to Records_** ** _;  Assistance_**

 

 

(a) From  the  date of this Agreement through the Closing, subject to the
terms of the  Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries  to, permit the Purchaser to have access at reasonable
times, and in a manner  so  as not to interfere with the normal business
operations of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries, to all books, records
(including tax records), contracts, and  documents of or pertaining to the
Business. Without the prior written consent  of  the Company, the Purchaser
shall not contact any of the Company's directors,  officers or employees, any
airport authorities, or any suppliers to, or  customers of, the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to the transactions  contemplated hereby.

(b) On  or  before the 45th day following the end of each fiscal quarter
ending on or before  the Closing (to the extent such 45th day falls on a date
prior to the Closing  Date), the Company will furnish to the Purchaser an
unaudited quarterly  consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end  of  such fiscal quarter, and the related
unaudited statements of cash flow and  income for the quarter then ended. On
or before the 30th day following the  end  of each month ending on or before
the Closing (to the extent such 30th day  falls  on a date prior to the
Closing Date), the Company will furnish to the Purchaser  an unaudited
monthly consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its  Subsidiaries as of
the end of such month, and the related unaudited statements  of cash flow and
income for the month then ended, in a form consistent with  monthly financial
statements historically prepared by the Company. The Company  shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Purchaser's sole cost and  expense,
to obtain comfort letters from the Company's accountants regarding 
information about the Company and the Subsidiaries as reasonably requested 
by  the Purchaser in order to comply with disclosure requirements applicable
to  any  of the Purchaser's Affiliates, and the consent of such accountants
to the  inclusion of that information in appropriate filings with the
Securities and  Exchange Commission. If the Closing occurs after June 30,
2007, the Company  will  furnish to the Purchaser, promptly after the
issuance of the audit report  thereof by its accountants, the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the  Company and its Subsidiaries and related
statements of cash flow and income  for  the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied  on  a consistent basis. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that a material inducement  to the Company and
Sellers entering into this Agreement is the absence of a  condition to
closing predicated upon the Purchaser's ability to obtain financing  to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, 
the  closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
be  conditioned upon the receipt of any such financing, and the Purchaser
hereby  agrees that absent willful or intentional breach of this _Section 
5.3(b)_   by the  Company the condition set forth in the last clause of
_Section  7.1(a)_   shall be  deemed satisfied. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will cooperate, and will  cause the Company's accountants and
other representatives to cooperate, with the  Purchaser and its accountants
and other representatives, at the Purchaser's sole  cost and expense, to
provide information and access to employees of the Company  and its
Subsidiaries to assist the Purchaser and its accountants and other 
representatives with the preparation of financial statements for and other 
disclosure about the Company and its Subsidiaries that are compliant with 
Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with
applicable  Legal Requirements or listing agreements with securities
exchanges; provided,  however, that: (i) the preparation of financial
statements for and other  disclosure about the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are compliant with  Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or otherwise in
accordance with applicable  Legal Requirements or listing agreements with
securities exchanges is not a  condition to Closing; and (ii) the failure to
have financial statements prepared  for and other disclosure about the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are  compliant with Regulation S-X of the
Securities Act or otherwise in accordance  with applicable Legal Requirements
or listing agreements with securities  exchanges shall not be a breach of the
covenant set forth above.

 

 

(c) From  and  after the Execution Date, the Seller Representative shall
cooperate fully (and  prior to the Closing shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to cooperate  fully), as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the Purchaser, in  connection with the filing of Tax Returns. From and
after the Closing Date,  the  Seller Representative shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably  requested by the Purchaser, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and  any  audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. In each case,  such  cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Purchaser's request) the  provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such  Tax Return
filing, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees  available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information  and 
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Purchaser shall
reimburse  the Seller Representative for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by  the  Seller Representative in connection with its compliance
with this _Section  5.3(c)_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) From  the  date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Sellers and
the Company shall  promptly notify the Purchaser if the City of Atlanta
initiates a formal request  for proposal process or similar request regarding
the rental of real property  _for  FBO operations or related business_ at 
the  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (the "Atlanta
Hartsfield FBO").  The Sellers and the Company shall permit the Purchaser to
be involved in all  aspects of the preparation and submission to the City of
Atlanta of any proposal  regarding  a new lease or extension or modification
of the existing lease  at the  Atlanta Hartsfield FBO, and shall not submit,
or allow to be submitted by any  of  their respective Affiliates, any such
proposal without the prior written consent  of the Purchaser, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or  conditioned.

the Company shall  promptly notify the Purchaser in writing if any

the representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements of the Sellers or
the Company or the conditions to  the  obligations of the Parties under this

this Agreement pursuant to _Section  9.1_   below  within ten (10) Business
Days after receiving notification of such development:  (i) the written
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.4_  shall be  deemed to have amended the
Schedules, to have qualified the representations  and  warranties contained
in _Articles  III_   or  _IV_   above,  and to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise  might have existed
hereunder by reason of the development; (ii) the Purchaser  shall be deemed
to have waived both its right to terminate this Agreement and  the closing
condition set forth in _Section  7.1_   with  respect to the matters
disclosed in such updated disclosure _Schedule_ ;  and  (iii) the Purchaser
shall be precluded from asserting any claims against the  Company or any of
the Sellers, whether before or after the Closing, by reason  any such
development.

 

 

(c) From  the  date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Purchaser
shall promptly notify  the Sellers in writing if any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser set  forth in this Agreement was untrue when made
or subsequently has become untrue;  provided that no such notice shall affect
the representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements of the Purchaser or
the conditions to the obligations  of  the Parties under this Agreement.

offering they may pursue following prior notice to the Sellers and the
Company  of such disclosure) and provided such disclosure is made in
accordance with  and  pursuant to Legal Requirements (including applicable

the fullest  extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all of the

Persons for acts or  omissions by such Covered Persons occurring prior to the
Closing Date to the  extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the
date of this Agreement,  whether pursuant to charter documents, bylaws or

Subsidiary, individual indemnity  agreements, board resolutions or otherwise,
but solely to the extent described  on the attached _D andO  Indemnification
Schedule_  and with  respect to claims by Persons other than the parties to

with respect to any claims by Persons  other than the parties to this
Agreement against such Covered Persons arising  out of such acts or

indirect subsidiary or Affiliate  thereof: (i) purchase, invest in or fund

benefit plans  in effect on the Closing or provide the individuals employed
by the Company  and  the Subsidiaries on the Closing Date with employee

the Straddle Period.

 

 

(c) After  the  Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall provide
each other, and the  Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries

request in: (a) filing any Tax  Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund; (b) determining any Tax  liability or a right to refund of Taxes; (c)

agreed terms to facilitate  the change in ownership and operation of the

The  Company shall cause its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to be

that, the  foregoing Basket Amount shall not apply to any claim based on

contrary: (i) no Seller shall  have any liability under _Section  6.2(a)(i)_
  in  excess of its or his percentage interest in the Escrow Fund, which
percentage  interest is set forth on an exhibit to the Escrow Agreement, and
the Purchaser's  sole and exclusive recourse for monetary damages against any
Seller related  thereto shall be limited to such Seller's percentage interest

the  aggregate amount of all indemnification obligations of the Sellers
pursuant  to  _Section  6.2_   or  _Section  5.19_   released  from
the Escrow Fund to Purchaser Indemnitees, and the Purchaser's sole and

which  indemnification is sought under this Agreement, there shall be
deducted the  amount of: (i) any insurance actually paid to such party as a
result of any  such  loss; and (ii) any Net Income Tax Benefit attributable
to such Losses. For  purposes of this Agreement, "Net Income Tax Benefit"
shall be an amount equal to  the present value of the net reduction in the
liability for Income Taxes of  the  Company and the Subsidiaries during any
period as a consequence of such Loss.  The present value amount of the Net
Income Tax Benefit shall be determined  by:  (i) using a discount rate equal
to four percent (4%), (ii) discounting back  to  the date on which the
applicable indemnity payment is due, and (iii) assuming  that the Net Income
Tax Benefit is used to reduce net income after all other  tax  deductions,
and using such other reasonable assumptions regarding the date  (or  dates)
on which such Net Income Tax Benefit will be realized.

 

 

(c) The  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that although the Purchaser
Indemnitees are  entitled to assert claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section  5.19_   or  _Section  6.2_   against  the Sellers, the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recovery from  the Sellers or
the Escrow Fund prior to pursuing in good faith all of the  remedies
available to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to such claims 
against the applicable third parties who have agreed to indemnify the
Company  and its Subsidiaries pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement among  the  Company, Mercury Air Group, Inc. and Allied Capital
Corporation dated October  28, 2003, as amended, or the stock purchase
agreements, asset purchase  agreements or merger agreements entered into
between such third parties and  the  Company and its Subsidiaries as listed

in the event that any such third party is subject to  a  voluntary or
involuntary petition under the federal bankruptcy laws or any  state 
insolvency law or the appointment of a receiver, fiscal agent or similar
officer  by a court for such third party's business or property, Purchaser
shall be  entitled to recovery from the Sellers or the Escrow Fund prior to

have a Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material  Adverse Effect or (B)
the aggregate liability arising from the claim could  reasonably be expected
to exceed the Indemnifying Party's liability to the  Indemnified Party.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding  _Section  6.5(b)(i)_   above,  the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such  claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that

Party without any liability of such Indemnified  Party.

 

 

(c) _Manner  of Payment by the Purchaser_.  Any  indemnification
obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section  6.3_   shall be  paid to
the Seller Indemnitees on a pro rata basis based upon each Seller's 
ownership of the Initial Closing Shares and the Option Shares immediately
prior  to the Closing Date, if applicable, by wire transfer of immediately
available  funds to the accounts designated in writing by the Seller
Indemnitees within  15  days after the determination thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Manner  of Payment by Sellers_.  Any  indemnification obligations of
the Sellers pursuant to _Section  6.2_   or  _Section  5.19_   shall be 
paid to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by

pay any such deficiency to the  Purchaser Indemnitees by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the  accounts designated in writing by the
