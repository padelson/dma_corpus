the Buyer and the Buyer shall bear all costs, penalties, fines and liabilities
of any other nature whatsoever (in each case, whether imposed on the Buyer,
the Sellers or any Group Company) resulting from not making any such filing,

removed or redacted) and a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content with
the Buyer prior to its notification, submission or filing with the competent
Governmental Authorities, (ii) consider and take into account all reasonable
comments or suggestions made by the Sellers Agent in this respect, and (iii)
where practicable, invite the Sellers Agent and its advisors to attend any
meetings or telephone conversations with the relevant Governmental

telephone conversations will be led by the Buyer and its advisors; 

---|---|---

make, as soon as possible and in any event within twenty Business Days after

Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
followed as soon as practicable by a full filing, with a view to obtain the
Merger Control Clearance within the shortest possible time, and supply
promptly any additional information and documents that may be requested by any
competent Governmental Authorities. The Buyer will use its best efforts to
obtain the Merger Control Clearance within the first phase of the Merger
Control Clearance process; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(c)

 |

do all things necessary or appropriate under applicable Laws to obtain the

Governmental Authority may require or impose in order to grant the Merger
Control Clearance, including divesting, disposing of, or taking actions that
limit the Buyers freedom of action with respect to any of the businesses or
assets of the Group or the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, any of the
Buyers obligations under this Clause 3.3 and any actions taken or omissions
in relation thereto shall not have any consequences on the Purchase Price or
the other terms and conditions of this Agreement;

     |

(d)

 |

not take any actions (including entering into any transaction, agreement or
other arrangement) which are reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay
or interfere with the satisfaction of the Merger Control Clearance Condition; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(e)

 |

subject to applicable Law and instructions of the relevant Governmental
Authority, keep the Sellers Agent or the Sellers counsel regularly informed
of the processing of the filings referred to above and in particular, if it
becomes aware of anything that may reasonably be 

---|---|--- 
 



9 delayed or denied and promptly provide the Sellers Agent or the Sellers
counsel with all non-privileged or non-commercially sensitive documents and
information concerning the filings and any material communication exchanged
with the relevant Governmental Authorities; and 
---|--- 



     |

(f)

 |

give notice to the Sellers Agent or the Sellers counsel of the satisfaction
of the Merger Control Clearance Condition mentioned in Clause 3.1 within two
Business Days of its becoming aware of the same (including as the case may be
a copy of the Merger Control Clearance decision). 

---|---|--- 
 



   



 |

Each Seller agrees, within the limits of its respective powers and at its sole
cost and expense, to fully co-operate with the Buyer so that it and its
advisers are promptly provided with such assistance and information and
documentary material as may be reasonably necessary for the Buyer to make the

If, after Completion, the Buyer becomes aware of any Leakage it may notify the
Sellers Agent (in writing) of such Leakage (a Leakage Notice) setting out
(i) the nature of the Leakage in reasonable detail; (ii) the relevant sub-

which would be necessary to put the relevant Group Company, the Direct
Investors Entity or the Private Investment Entity into the financial position
it would have been in had there been no Leakage (the Leakage Amount), or if
such amount is not known, a reasonable estimate of the Leakage Amount; and
(iv) if any calculation is relevant, the Buyers calculation of such Leakage
Amount. If the Sellers Agent does not dispute the Leakage Amount
within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the Leakage Notice, the
Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed the relevant Leakage Amount included in
the Leakage Notice. Any Leakage Notice given after Completion must be made by
the later of (a) 1 March 2018 and (b) six months after the Completion Date.

If the Sellers Agent intends to dispute any Leakage Amount included in any
Leakage Notice it shall give notice in writing of such fact to the Buyer
within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the Leakage Notice specifying
which matters are in dispute (a Leakage Dispute Notice). To the extent that
the Sellers Agent and the Buyer cannot reach agreement on the relevant
Leakage Amount within fifteen (15) Business Days after service of such Leakage
Dispute Notice (the Leakage Agreement Period), the Buyer or the Sellers Agent
may refer the dispute to such person at an independent firm of chartered
accountants of international repute as the Buyer and the Sellers Agent may
agree or, failing such person accepting such appointment or such agreement
within five (5) Business Days after the last day of the Leakage Agreement
Period, to such person as the President for the time being of the Dutch
Institute of Chartered Accountants ( _Nederlandse_ ___Beroepsorganisatie_ _van
Accountants (NBA)_ ) or its successor organisation, nominate (the Expert).
Such referral shall be on the basis that the Expert is to make a decision on
the dispute and notify the Buyer and the Seller of its decision within ten
(10) Business Days of receiving the reference or such longer reasonable
period as the Expert may determine.

---|---|--- 



    

6.6

 |

If any Leakage Amount has been agreed or determined before Completion, it
shall be included in the Pre-Completion Statement in accordance with Clause
5.2(a). If any Leakage Amount is agreed or determined after Completion, the
relevant Seller(s) shall as an exclusive remedy pay to the Buyer within
five (5) Business Days following the date of such agreement or determination,
an amount equal to such Leakage Amount. Any amount payable by the Sellers
under this Clause 6 shall be deemed so far as possible to constitute a

(B)

 |

such amendment or waiver would not make more onerous on it the conditions
