Japan (" _Kuraray_ "), Kuraray Holdings U.S.A., Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), KJ Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Calgon Carbon Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Kuraray and Parent have approved this
Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") and the other Transactions, in each case, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of the Company and Merger Sub has (a)
determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, (b) approved and declared advisable the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the

and

 

WHEREAS, Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with, and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Jones Day, 500 Grant Street, Suite 4500,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day

 



-1-  after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions (other than any
condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to satisfaction or waiver of any such condition) set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VII_ or on such other date as is mutually agreed to in writing
by the parties to this Agreement. The date on which the Closing shall occur is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective_ _Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause
the Merger to become effective by executing and filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") at the Closing (or at such other time or date as Kuraray and the
Company may agree in writing) in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by Kuraray and the
Company in writing, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effect_ _of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises
and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
the Company and Merger Sub, the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of the Company (the " _Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as is set
forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable Law,
subject to the obligations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
the Company and Merger Sub, the amended and restated bylaws of the Company
(the " _Amended and Restated Bylaws_ ") shall be amended so as to read in
their entirety in the form as is set forth on  _Exhibit_ __ _ B_ hereto,
and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, with the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law,
subject to the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their 

 



-2-  successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, in
each case, as may be amended from time to time.

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested
in or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub or
otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable
to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Kuraray, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Shares_ ") or any other securities of the Company or the holders of any
securities of Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)_) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to
receive $21.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") or any book-entry Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the
manner provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. All such Shares, when so converted,
will no longer be outstanding, will automatically be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist. Each holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,
without interest.

 

(b) Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) Share owned by
Kuraray or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Kuraray
immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) Dissenting Share will no
longer be outstanding, will automatically be cancelled and retired and will
cease to 

 



-3-  exist, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to
such Shares subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to the right of the
holder thereof to receive any payment under  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Kuraray or Parent shall select a paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger to receive the
funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_.
At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Kuraray shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account
for the benefit of holders of Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ "), the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ upon the surrender of such holders
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_. The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Kuraray or Parent shall
appoint the Paying Agent shall be in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company.

 

(b) 

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter, Kuraray shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in form reasonably agreed
by Kuraray and the Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or the Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may thereafter surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such
holder. Upon delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal in accordance with the instructions thereto and the surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Kuraray shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an

 



-4-  amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) so
surrendered. Until so surrendered, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other
than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_) will
represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration
relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares are registered, it will be a
condition to such payment that the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax is not applicable.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, the holder of such Shares will be
given a copy of the letter of transmittal and the instructions thereto
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ and will be instructed to comply with
such instructions in order to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
such holders Shares. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable
upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares
which immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.

 

(d) On the date which is one year after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall deliver to Kuraray, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Kuraray may designate in its discretion, the undistributed portion of the
Payment Fund, including any interest received with respect thereto, and any
Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to the
Transactions, which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
previously delivered to Kuraray, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and
thereafter such holders (other than with respect to any Shares contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_) will be entitled to look to Kuraray, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or 

 



-5-  similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration payable thereon upon
due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest on such Merger Consideration. Immediately prior to the
date on which any Merger Consideration would escheat or otherwise become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Kuraray, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as Kuraray may designate, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Kuraray, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person will be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) 

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary other
than  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)(ii)_, Kuraray, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares,
and from amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under any Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or
deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares or other securities in respect of which
such deduction and withholding were made.

(ii) If Kuraray determines that any portion of a payment made pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ is subject to withholding Tax pursuant to Sections 897
and 1445 of the Code, Kuraray shall promptly notify the Company in writing of
such determination and provide the Company with a written explanation
setting forth the reasons for such withholding. Kuraray shall provide any
such notification and written explanation to the Company no later than 20 days
prior to the Closing Date. During the ten day period following the delivery of
such notification and written explanation, the Company shall review such
written explanation and shall notify Kuraray in writing of any disagreement
with such explanation and any proposal for the reduction of withholding Tax.
Kuraray and the Company shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement and minimize any required withholding during the five day period
following the Companys response to Kurarays notification and written
explanation.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall terminate and be converted
into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share set forth in such
Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each
holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights under or with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The
Option Cash Payment shall be made by the Surviving Corporation to the
applicable holder promptly following the Effective Time (and no later than
the later of (x) five Business Days following the Effective Time and (y) the
end of the first payroll period of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time).

 



-7- (b) Each unvested share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding as
of the Effective Time shall vest, and the holder thereof shall receive (i)
payment with respect to each such vested share of Company Restricted Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, and (ii) a cash payment equal to any
outstanding cash dividends that have accumulated but not been paid by the
Company with respect to such shares of Company Restricted Stock.

 

(c) Each Company Phantom Stock Unit Award that is outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time shall terminate and be converted into

cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Phantom Stock Unit Award, including any dividends credited with
respect thereto, and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Phantom Stock Unit
Award Cash Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Phantom Stock Unit Award shall cease to have any rights under or with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Phantom Stock Unit Award Cash
Payment. The Phantom Stock Unit Award Cash Payment shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation to the applicable holder promptly following

following the Effective Time and (y) the end of the first payroll period of
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time).

 

(d) Each Company Performance Share Award that is outstanding or payable as
of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall terminate and be
converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of
Shares underlying such Company Performance Share Award (assuming payout at
100% of target) and (B) the Merger Consideration, plus (ii) the cash dividends
that would have been paid from the effective date of the Company Performance
Share Award through the Effective Time, had the Company Performance Share
Award represented Shares issued and outstanding during such period (assuming
payout at 100% of target) (collectively, the " _Performance Share Award Cash
Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Performance
Share Award shall cease to have any rights under or with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Performance Share Award Cash Payment. The
Performance Share Award Cash Payment shall be made by the Surviving

Compensation Committee shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

 

Section 2.4 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Shares that have not been voted for
adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal has been
properly demanded in accordance with, and at all times the holder of such
Shares has been in compliance with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting
Shares_ _"_ ) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at or after the Effective Time, but instead at the

 



-8-  Effective Time shall become entitled to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws, loses or becomes ineligible for such appraisal or
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such
holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share, and each such
Share will be deemed to have converted as of the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest. The Company shall give Kuraray prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and
Kuraray shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Kuraray, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to take or commit to take any such action.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company shall occur as a
result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to provide the holders thereof the
same economic effect contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be
construed to permit the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Kuraray,
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person to take any action otherwise prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

Shares (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)_) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to

by Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub.

represents all the action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement
and the Transactions the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL to the extent,
if any, such section would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement and the
Transactions. No other "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium" or other antitakeover Law applies to this Agreement or the

Parent of any of its Affiliates from exercising its ownership of Shares
acquired in the Merger (collectively, together with Section 203 of the DGCL,

information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub in certain
"data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions.

makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
any "Confidential Information" as defined in the Secrecy Agreement, dated
January 10, 2017, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied on any
representation, warranty or other statement by any Person on behalf of Kuraray
or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the representations and warranties of
Kuraray, Parent and Merger Sub expressly contained in this Agreement,

__

 



-40-   _Section_ _5.2(c)_ ) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ")
constituting, relating to or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or,
if acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the Company, any of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries Representatives, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ by the Company. The Company shall cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any
Person (other than Kuraray, Parent, their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) that existed or was taking place at or prior to the execution
of this Agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and, with
respect to any such solicitation, discussion or negotiation that has existed
or been taking place during the 12 months prior to the date hereof, request
that such Person promptly destroy (and certify destruction of) or return to
the Company all non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Until the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (but in any event
within 24 hours) after receipt thereof, notify Kuraray orally and in writing
of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for information relating
to, or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
any such Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii) the material
terms and conditions of such Company Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry
(including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such material
terms and conditions).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ or any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time prior to
obtaining the Stockholder Approval the Company Board receives a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which
Company Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2_, then (A) the Company and its Representatives may deliver a written
communication to such Person or group of Persons solely for the purpose of
clarifying the terms and conditions thereof (it being understood that a copy
of such written communication and any of such Persons or group of Persons
responses thereto shall be promptly delivered to Kuraray within 24 hours of
delivery or receipt, as applicable), and (B) if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and that a failure to take
any of the following actions would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Law, then the Company and its
Representatives may (i) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with such Person or group of Persons, (ii) furnish, pursuant to such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or

-41-  Kuraray any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 5.2(c)(ii)_ which was not previously provided to Kuraray or its
Representatives and (iii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person or group of Persons with respect to such

(d) With respect to any Company Takeover Proposal for which the Company or
its Representatives take any action described in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, the
Company shall (i) keep Kuraray informed on a reasonably current basis
regarding material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any
such Company Takeover Proposal, the material details related thereto
(including material amendments as to price and other material terms made by
the Person or group of Persons making such Company Takeover Proposal),
and (ii) promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after receipt thereof,
provide Kuraray with copies of all material documents and other material
written communications relating to such Company Takeover Proposal exchanged
between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person or group of Persons (or any
Representative thereof) making such Company Takeover Proposal, on the other
hand.

 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(e)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(g)_, the Company Board shall
not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, fail to make or modify, or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, fail to make or modify, in a
manner adverse to Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation,
(C) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication (it being understood that the
Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal until the close of business as of the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of a tender offer in connection with such Company
Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without
such action being considered an adverse modification), (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, a Company
Takeover Proposal or (E) agree or resolve to take the actions set forth in
the foregoing _clauses (A)_ through _(D)_ (the actions described in this
_clause (_ _i_ _)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that did not
result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (i) the 

 



-42-  failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
the Company has given Kuraray at least three Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the
reasons therefor and include an unredacted copy of any relevant Company
Acquisition Agreement and related proposed transaction agreements and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Company Superior
Proposal), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith with Kuraray and its Representatives during such
notice period to enable Kuraray to propose in writing an offer binding on
Kuraray to effect revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal, in the opinion of
the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C)
following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith such binding offer by Parent and Kuraray to revise
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the relevant Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal even if the revisions proposed in such binding offer
were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of any material change to any
of the material terms or conditions of any such Company Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Kuraray an additional notice
consistent with that described in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ above and the notice
period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be only two
Business Days).

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company may, in response to an
Intervening Event, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company has given Kuraray at least five
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the
Intervening Event and the reasons for the Company Adverse Recommendation
Change), (ii) if Kuraray requests, the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Kuraray and its
Representatives during such notice period after giving any such notice to
enable Kuraray to propose in writing an offer binding on Parent and Kuraray to
effect revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a
manner that would obviate the need for making such Change of Recommendation,
and (iii) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any proposal by Kuraray to revise the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that a
failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



-43- (h) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or in _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the Company Boards
determination in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, in each case, if any such disclosure would otherwise be a violation of
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(e)_, then such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to
thereto, the Company shall provide Kuraray and its counsel the reasonable

convene and hold a meeting of the Companys record date stockholders
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether the

Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or

to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable or (iii) for a single

-45- Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approval Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use,
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Law to consummate as promptly as practicable
the Transactions, including (i) the preparation and filing as promptly as
practicable of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to
consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all actions necessary to obtain
(and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act or
the DPA and in connection with approvals of or filings with any Governmental
Entity) required to be obtained or made by Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection
with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) taking all actions necessary to remove (and to cooperate with
each other in removing) any impediment to consummating the Transactions, and
(v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to
use, all reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the
Merger and shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result
in not obtaining, any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or
exemption by, any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Kuraray to obtain the consents and waivers set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter from applicable
third parties in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ that (i) Kuraray shall, upon request of
the Company, promptly reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation, and (ii) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to, prior to the Closing, in connection with
obtaining such consents and waivers, incur any liability (other than any
liability contemplated by the foregoing _clause (i)_ ), execute or amend any
Contract or take any other action, in each case, except as is conditioned on
the Closing. Kuraray, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that
(x) obtaining any consent or waiver contemplated by the foregoing sentence is
not a condition to the Closing, and affirms its obligations to consummate the
Transactions (subject to the conditions contained in _Article VII_ )
irrespective and independently of the receipt of any such consents or waivers
and (y) a failure to comply with the foregoing sentence shall not constitute
the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.

 



-46- (b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and upon the terms and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Company, Kuraray, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the matters contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
including by (i) permitting, to the extent practicable, the other to review
and discuss in advance, and considering in good faith the views of the other
in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed oral)
communication with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions, (ii) cooperating with the other to furnish such other
with necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the parties mutual cooperation in
preparing any necessary filings or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; (iii)
promptly consulting with, and providing any necessary information to, the
other parties to this Agreement with respect to all filings made by such party
with any Governmental Entity; (iv) promptly informing the other parties to
this Agreement of any material communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any of the Transactions and, if such communication is in writing,
furnish the other parties (or their counsel) with copies of such
communication; and (v) furnishing the other parties with copies of all
correspondence and filings between it and any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions. Materials shared by any party to this
Agreement with any other party may be appropriately redacted or
otherwise limited in disclosure (A) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, (B) as necessary to comply with any regulatory requirements, and
(C) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege
or confidentiality concerns. To the extent practicable, no party shall
participate, nor permit any of its Representatives to participate, in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions unless it notifies the other parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the other
parties the opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings or other
substantive interactions with any such Governmental Entity.

(c) The Company and Kuraray shall file or cause to be filed (i) as promptly
as practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and (ii) as promptly
as practicable, any other filings and/or notifications that may be necessary
or, in the reasonable opinion of Kuraray, advisable under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of the Company, Kuraray and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, provide to any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Company, Kuraray, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, including the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, all non-privileged
information and documents that are required or reasonably requested by any
such Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws or by Kuraray
or Parent in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



-47- (d) If any party to this Agreement or any Representative of such parties
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party will use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and
after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an appropriate
response in and certification of compliance with such request. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Kuraray, Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company shall, without the other parties prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter
into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit
to any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending, suspending,
lengthening or otherwise tolling the expiration or termination of any waiting
period under, or otherwise delaying receipt of any of the clearances,
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Furthermore, the Company shall not, without
Kurarays or Parents prior written consent, (i) commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of the capital stock or other equity or voting
interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or Kuraray,
Parent, Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (ii) agree to
commitments with respect to the business, products, governance, personnel,
assets or activities of Kuraray, Parent, Company or of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as of prior to Closing), or otherwise limit
Parents freedom of action with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates after the Closing, in each case, in order to obtain any of the
clearances, consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

 

(e) Each of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or
state or foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). Each of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub,
and the Company shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take such
action as may be required to cause early termination (if possible), or other
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement.

 

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(g)_, if and to the extent
necessary to obtain clearance or approval of the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law, each of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub, together with their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates and, solely to the extent requested by
Kuraray or Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates will (i)
use reasonable best efforts to oppose, contest,

 



-48-  resist or remove, including through litigation or appeal of any motion or
action of a Governmental Entity, any impediment to obtaining the necessary
clearances or approvals under any Antitrust Law, prior to the Outside Date;
and (ii) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting
interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, prior to the Outside Date; and
(iii) agree to commitments with respect to the business, products,
governance, personnel, assets, activities or sensitive governmental customers
of the Company and its Affiliates (as of prior to Closing), prior to the
Outside Date.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall be required, in order to gain any clearances or approvals
under the Antitrust Laws, to (i) commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub
or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (ii) agree to commitments with
respect to the business, products, governance, personnel, assets or activities
of Kuraray, Parent, the Company or of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (as of prior to Closing), or otherwise limit Kurarays or Parents
freedom of action with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates after the Closing, in the case of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , if such commitments or other obligations would be, individually or
in the aggregate, materially adverse to the business, assets, properties,
results of operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Kuraray and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, as applicable.

(h) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.3_, Kuraray, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval. Such reasonable best efforts shall
include promptly after the date hereof preparing, prefiling, and then filing
with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA with respect to the
Transactions, and providing any additional or supplemental information,
certifications and agreements requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch
of the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within the timeframes
required by the DPA, unless CFIUS agrees in writing to an extension of such
timeframe. With respect to Parent, such reasonable best efforts shall include
negotiating and concluding a binding mitigation agreement with CFIUS under
Section 721(l) of the DPA that CFIUS may require as a condition of granting
CFIUS Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Kuraray, nor Parent, nor
any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to take or commit to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to (i) sell, divest, license or
otherwise dispose of, or otherwise limit Kurarays or Parents freedom of

 



-49-  action with respect to, any capital stock or other equity or voting
interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (as of prior to the Closing), taken as a whole; or (ii) sell,
divest, license or otherwise dispose of, or otherwise limit Kurarays or
Parents freedom of action with respect to, any capital stock or other equity
or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products
or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries if, in the case of the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , such commitments or other obligations
would be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the
business, assets, properties, results of operations, or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
Kuraray and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event that CFIUS notifies Kuraray, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company that CFIUS (A) has completed its review or investigation and
(B) intends to send a report to the President of the United States
recommending that the President suspend or prohibit the Transactions, Kuraray
and the Company may, upon the mutual written consent of Kuraray and the
Company, request a withdrawal of any filing or notification made to CFIUS.
Each party hereto shall afford the other the opportunity to review and comment
in advance on any submissions to CFIUS to be made by the submitting party,
except for personal identifier information or other information proprietary
to the submitting party. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that the President takes
final action to prohibit the Transactions (a " _CFIUS Turndown_ "), none of
Kuraray, Parent or the Company shall have any further obligation to seek the
CFIUS Approval.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, Kuraray, Parent and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare and submit, as promptly as practicable but

commenced or, to the Knowledge of the parties, threatened against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting the parties that, if pending as of or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to _Article III_ o _r Article IV_ , as applicable, or that

the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not

party receiving such notice, nor shall any such notice operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision of
this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
a failure to comply with this _ Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not constitute the
failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the
underlying Change would independently result in the failure of such condition
to be satisfied.

 

Section 6.5 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide Parent and its
Representatives, from time to time prior to the earlier of the Effective Time

access during normal business hours for the purpose of consummating the
Transactions to (a) the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, assets,
books, Contracts, personnel and records and (b) such other information as
Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial condition and
operations; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall

times or in a manner that the Companys Representatives reasonably believe is
likely to disrupt the ordinary course operations of the businesses of the

respective Affiliates and Representatives to keep confidential any non-public

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Kuraray, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party, to the extent set forth in the respective constituent
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Contract or form
of Contract filed with the SEC, with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel)
in connection with any Action, whenever asserted, to the extent based on
or arising out of (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or (ii)
acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) or taken at the request of the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company (or any such other Person), in each case under the foregoing
_clause (i)_ or _clause (ii)_ , at, or at any time prior to, the Effective
Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party).

(b) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Kuraray, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will jointly and severally provide exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to each Indemnified Party for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the full extent such
exculpation, indemnification or advancement rights exist in favor of the
Indemnified Parties under the respective constituent documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in any Contract or form of Contract filed with the
SEC, in each case to the extent they are enforceable under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period will continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom

 



-52-  expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to repay such advances if it shall be
determined by a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent,
from and after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time,
will cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers, indemnification and advancement of expenses than are
set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Companys constituent
documents and/or available under applicable Law, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(c) Parent will obtain as of the Effective Time a "tail" insurance policy
or policies with a reporting period of six years from the Effective Time
covering directors and officers and fiduciary liabilities and covering each
Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with at least the same coverage
and scope, and in amounts, and containing terms and conditions, that are no
less favorable to such Persons than such policy in effect on the date hereof,
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, including
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Kuraray,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay premiums for any "tail"
insurance policies under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(c)_ which, in the
aggregate, exceed 300% of the then-existing annual premiums; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such 300% amount.
Kuraray, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their reasonable best
efforts (but in no event less effort than expended with respect to their own
current directors and officers) to cause such policy or policies to be
maintained in full force and effect, for their full term, and to honor all of
their obligations thereunder.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or
actual litigation, claim, or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions
that are potentially subject to indemnification under this _Section_ __ _
6.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ "), Kuraray, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
cooperate with the Indemnified Parties in the Indemnified Parties defense of
such Claim, shall provide access to information, properties and individuals as
may be reasonably requested, and shall furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. None of Kuraray, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim
for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of, and no
admission of wrongdoing in respect of, such Claim, or (ii) such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or entry of
judgment (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 



-53- (e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and/or
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Companys constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Kuraray, Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ (and the "tail policy" obtained pursuant thereto) may not
be terminated, canceled or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law, as established by a final nonappealable judgment or (ii) the affected
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ applies will be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_).

 

(f) In the event Kuraray, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Kuraray, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Parent and Merger Sub Compliance_. Kuraray shall cause
Parent, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub, to comply with all of their
respective obligations under or related to this Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate and consult with one another, and the Company shall give Kuraray
the opportunity to consult in the defense, settlement or prosecution of, any
Action (including derivative claims) brought by any one or more stockholders
of the Company against the Company, members of the Company Board or any of
the Companys officers with respect to the Transactions. In connection with
the foregoing, the parties will take steps to reasonably permit the disclosure
of information without jeopardizing the attorney-client privilege or other
applicable protections. The Company shall keep Kuraray reasonably informed
with respect to the status of any such Action brought against the Company,
members of the Company Board or any of the Companys officers and the Company
shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such Action or
consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Kuraray (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
furtherance of and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to prevail in such
litigation so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 



-54- Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall honor all Company Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time. For a period of 18 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who were employed as of the Effective Time (the " _Company
Employees_ _"_ ): (i) salary, wage, commission, incentive compensation and
bonus opportunity that is no less favorable in the aggregate (and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, need not
include equity compensation or equity compensation opportunity as part of such
aggregate) than the salary, wage, commission, incentive compensation
(including, for purposes of determining the aggregate value of compensation
and compensation opportunity, equity compensation and equity compensation
opportunity) and bonus opportunity that was provided to such Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) employee retirement,
welfare and other benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the employee retirement, welfare and other benefits provided to such Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(taking into account such Company Employees service as required pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_).

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, level of benefits
and benefit accruals (but not level of benefits or benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) providing benefits to
any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors before the Effective Time, to at
least the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any corresponding employee
benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of each New
Plan providing welfare benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause
all pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
spouse and covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her spouse and covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the corresponding Company Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
Transactions ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee

 



-55-  and his or her spouse and covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any New Plan that is insured, such amounts
shall be taken into account only to the extent the insurer consents thereto.
Kuraray or Parent shall, or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, credit each Company
Employee with the accrued and unused vacation, personal and sickness days to
which such Company Employee is entitled through the Effective Time.

 

(c) No provision in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, whether express or implied,
shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), any other participant in any
Company Plan or any other Person; (ii) create any rights to continued
employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Kuraray, Parent or any
of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or in any way limit the ability of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Kuraray, Parent or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment of any individual at
any time and for any reason; or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Kuraray, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

 

Section 6.11 _Parent Approval_. Immediately following the execution of

Company shall, and from and after the Effective Time, Kuraray, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules
and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event within ten days after the Closing Date) and
the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

 

Section 6.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each Person who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions, Kuraray, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company and their respective boards of directors shall grant such
reasonable approvals and take such reasonable actions as are necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Takeover Statute on the Transactions.

 



-56- Section 6.15 _Control of Operations_. Without limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
(a) give Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time and
(b) the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
Kurarays, Parents or Merger Subs operations prior to the Effective Time.

over its operations.

any kind, including consequential damages and any other damages (whether or
not communicated or contemplated at the time of execution of this Agreement),
arising out of any fraud or any knowing and intentional breach by such party
prior to such termination, it being understood that the failure of Kuraray,
Parent or Merger Sub to effect the Closing when required under the terms of
this Agreement shall constitute a knowing and intentional breach. No party
claiming that such fraud or breach occurred will have any duty or otherwise
be obligated to mitigate any such damages, and such party will be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at law or in equity with respect to such
fraud or breach, including in the case of a breach by Kuraray, Parent
or Merger Sub, liability to the Company for damages, determined taking into
account all relevant factors including the loss of the benefit of the

provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ or (iii) by either Kuraray or the

and (A) prior to such termination a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been

or prior to the 12 month anniversary of such termination the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or a Company
Takeover Proposal is consummated

 



-61-  (provided that solely for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(iii)(B)_,
the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the
definition of Company Takeover Proposal except that all references to 15%
shall be deemed references to 50%), the Company shall pay Kuraray the

of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, on the earlier of the date of the Company
Acquisition Agreement or upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the relevant Company Takeover Proposal. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a
non-refundable cash amount equal to $33,200,000. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, payment of the Termination Fee shall
constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such termination as
described in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective former, current or future directors, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have no further liability of any
kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination

8.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_. In no event shall the Termination Fee be
paid more than once.

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are integral parts of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, Kuraray, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner
any amount due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub commences an Action that
results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Kuraray
interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount
was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set
forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 1%, together with reasonable fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and expenses) incurred in

written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, and (b) this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.12_
are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the

-65- Section 9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to
be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in order that the Transactions are fulfilled
to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.9 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising
out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed

without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of Laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

(b) Any action, suit or proceeding based upon, arising out of or related
to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any

federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court
of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of
the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such
court in any such action, suit or proceeding, waives any objection it may now
or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum,
agrees that all claims in respect of the action, suit or proceeding shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law
or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party
in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any
action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.9(b)_.

Section 9.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties
hereto and any be enforceable by their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part,
(a) by Kuraray or Parent without the prior written consent of the Company or
(b) by the Company without the prior written consent of Kuraray.

 



-66- Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree
that (i) the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate
for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall
not be construed or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to
specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Transactions and without that right, none of the
Company, Kuraray, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement.
Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The parties acknowledge
and agree that any party entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction
and any party against whom such injunction is entered expressly waives any
bond or security in connection therewith.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, any of the parties may pursue both a grant
of specific performance to the extent permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_
and the payment of damages as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_. 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER_ _OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT

Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person
who is not specified in Article VI but whom the corporation has the power or
obligation to indemnify under applicable law, or otherwise. _EXHIBIT B_

_Section_ __ _ 1.01_. _Annual Meeting; Election of Directors_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors by resolution shall designate the time, place
and date of the annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of
directors and the transaction of such other business as may come before it.

 

(b) The stockholders may elect the Board of Directors by written consent in
lieu of the annual meeting. If the consent is less than unanimous, it will
constitute a consent in lieu of the annual meeting only if all of the
directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at
the effective time of the consent were (i) vacant at the effective time and
(ii) filled by action of the consent.

(c) If the annual meeting is not held on the date designated for it or if
the Board of Directors has not been elected by written consent in lieu of an
annual meeting, the standing directors shall cause the meeting to be held as
soon as it is convenient.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.02_. _Special Meetings_.

 

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may

Delaware, as shall be fixed by the person or persons calling the meeting and
stated in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting.

(b) The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that a
stockholders meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication. Further, the board of directors may,
in its sole discretion, authorize stockholders and proxyholders not
physically present at a meeting of stockholders to, by means of remote
communication and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of
Directors may adopt: (i) participate in a meeting of stockholders and (ii) be
deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such
meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication. If the Board of Directors authorizes a meeting solely by
remote communication, the Corporation must (A) implement reasonable measures
to verify that  each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of
remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (B) implement reasonable
measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of
the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C)
maintain a record of any vote or other action taken at the meeting by means of
remote communication by any stockholder or proxyholder.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.03_. _Notice of Meetings of Stockholders._

 

(a) Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a
meeting, written notice of the meeting shall be given, unless that notice
shall be waived, which shall state the place, if any, means of remote
communication, if any, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The
written notice of any meeting shall be given, personally or by mail, not less
than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

 

(b) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned
meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.04_. _Quorum_.

 

(a) At all meetings of the stockholders, the holders of one-third of the
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business.

 

(b) When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken
by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders.

(c) The stockholders present may adjourn the meeting despite the absence of
a quorum and at any such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of
voting stock shall be represented, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting had a quorum been
there present.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.05_. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

 

In order to determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment
of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled
to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange
of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix,  in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than
ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to
any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.06_. _Stockholder s Right of Inspection_.

 

(a) Stockholders of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall
have the right, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof,
during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the
Corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books
and records, and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall
mean a purpose reasonably related to such persons interest as a stockholder.
In every instance where an attorney or other agent shall be the person who
seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by
a power of attorney or such other writing which authorizes the attorney or
other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath
shall be directed to the Corporation at its registered office in the State
of Delaware or at its principal place of business.

(b) The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list or the books
of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1.07_. _Consent in Lieu of Meeting_.

 

(a) Any corporate action, with respect to which the vote of the
stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted by any provision
of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, or these By-
laws, may be taken without that vote and meeting, and that vote and meeting
may be dispensed with, if that corporate action has been consented to in
writing by the holders of a majority (or, if with respect to a particular
corporate action the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
or these By-laws specifies a greater percentage, by the holders of that
percentage) of the stock that would have been entitled to vote upon that
action if a meeting were held. Prompt notice shall be given to
all stockholders of the taking of any corporate action pursuant to the
provisions of that paragraph unless that action has been consented to in
writing by the holders of all of the stock that would have been entitled to
vote upon that action if a meeting were held.

(b) A stockholder or proxyholder may consent to action by means of a
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission. The stockholder, the
proxyholder or a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or
proxyholder must transmit the consent. The consent shall be deemed to be
written, signed and dated if the transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the transmission
was transmitted by the stockholder, proxyholder or authorized person(s), and
(ii) the date on which it was transmitted. The date on which the transmission
is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which the consent was signed. (c) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent
in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for all
purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that the
reproduction is of the entire original writing.

expressly conferred upon it herein, by statute, by the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or otherwise, is hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers as may be exercised by the Corporation, except as expressly
provided otherwise by the DGCL, by the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation or by these By-laws.

(c) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Board of
Directors, by resolution or resolutions, may create and issue, whether or not
in connection with the issue and sale of any shares of stock or other
securities of the Corporation, rights or options entitling the

stock of any class or classes or any other securities of the Corporation, such
rights or options to be evidenced by or in such instrument or instruments as
shall be approved by the Board of Directors. The terms upon which, including
the time or times, which may be limited or unlimited in duration, at or within

shall be fixed and stated in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors providing for the creation and issue of such rights or
options, and, in every case, set forth or incorporated by reference in the
instrument or instruments evidencing such rights or options. In the absence of
actual fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board of Directors as to
the consideration for the issuance of such rights or options and the
sufficiency thereof shall be conclusive. If the shares of stock of the
Corporation to be issued upon the exercise of such rights or options shall be
shares having a par value, the price or prices so to be received therefor
shall not be less than the par value thereof. If the shares of stock so to be
issued shall be shares of stock without par value, the consideration therefor
shall be determined in the manner provided in Section 153(b) of the DGCL.

_Section_ __ _ 2.02_. _Qualifications and Number of Directors_.

therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

_Section_ __ _ 2.05_. _Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships_.

 

Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors
then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director,
and the directors so chosen shall hold office until their successors shall be
duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal. When one or more directors shall resign from the Board, effective at
a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who
have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become
effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as herein provided in
the filling of other vacancies.

(a) At all meetings of the Board of Directors, one-third of the entire
Board, but not less than two directors, shall constitute a quorum for the

notice to the directors or waiver thereof.

(c) Unless waived, notice of each special meeting of the Board of
Directors, stating the time and place of the meeting, shall be given to each
director by delivered letter, by telegram or by personal communication either
over the telephone or otherwise, in each such case not later than the second
day prior to the meeting, or by mailed letter deposited in the United States
mail with postage thereon prepaid not later than the seventh day prior to the

thereof need not state the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

of such committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member and all
alternate members designated to serve in the place and stead of such member,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from

unanimously appoint another director to act at the meeting in the place and
stead of such absent or disqualified member.

 

(b) Any committee may exercise the power and authority of the Board of
Directors to the extent specified by the resolution establishing such
committee, or the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws; provided,
however, that no committee may take any action that is expressly required by
the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to be taken by
the stockholders and/or the Board of Directors and not by a committee thereof.
Each committee shall keep a record of its acts and proceedings, which shall
form a part of the records of the Corporation in the custody of the Secretary,
and all actions of each committee, shall be reported to the Board of
Directors at the next meeting of the Board.

 

(c) Meetings of committees may be called at any time by the Chairman of the
Board, if any, the President or the chairman of the respective committee. At
least fifty percent of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business and, except as expressly limited by this
section, the act of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which
there is a quorum shall be the act of such committee. Except as expressly
provided in this section or in the resolution designating the committee, a

and/or such other authority, duties and powers as may be assigned to him from
time to time by the Board of Directors or the President. The other officers,
and agents, if any, shall have the authority, perform the duties and exercise
the powers in the management of the Corporation usually incident to the

 _Capital Stock_

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.01_. _Stock Certificates_.

 

The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates in such
form as any officer may approve; provided, however, the Board of Directors
may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all
classes or series of the Corporations stock shall be uncertificated shares.
Each certificate for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise
identified. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to
have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the
President or a Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or the Secretary, of the
Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation.
Where such certificate is signed (1) by a transfer agent other than the
Corporation or its employee, or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation
or its employee, the signatures of the officers of the Corporation may be
facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature
has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such officer at the date of issue.

_Section_ __ _ 4.02_. _Transfers_.

DGCL. 

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.03_. _Registered Holders_.

bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, any
security, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice thereof, except as
otherwise provided by the DGCL.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4.04_. _New Certificates_.

 

The Corporation shall issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any
certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, if the owner: (1) so requests before the Corporation has notice
that the shares of stock represented by that certificate have been acquired by
a bona fide purchaser; (2) files with the Corporation a bond sufficient
(in the judgment of the directors) to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss or theft of
that certificate or the issuance of a new certificate; and (3) satisfies any
other requirements imposed by the directors that are reasonable under the
circumstances. A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond
when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper so to do. _ARTICLE V_

 

 _Indemnification_

 

 _Section_ __ _ 5.01_. _Indemnification_.

 

Directors and officers of the Corporation shall be indemnified as of right to

actual or threatened civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit or proceeding (whether brought by or in the name of the Corporation or
otherwise) arising out of their service to the Corporation or to
another organization at the request of the Corporation. Persons who are not
directors or officers of the Corporation, including each person who at the
request of the Corporation has served as a director, officer, employee, or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (individually, including directors or officers of the Corporation,
an "Indemnified Person" and collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") may
be similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the extent authorized
at any time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The Corporation may
purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Indemnified Person
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in respect of
such service whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
him against such liability by law or under the provisions of this Article. The
provisions of this Article shall be applicable to actions, suits or
proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or
omissions occurring before or after the adoption hereof, and to Indemnified
Persons who have ceased to render such service, and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of the directors, officers and
other persons referred to in this Article V.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 5.02_. _ Payment of Indemnification_.

 

Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
by the corporation as authorized in this Article V. Such expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by Indemnified Persons may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.

_Section_ __ _ 5.03_. _ Exclusivity_.

 

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, these By-
Laws or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of
the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in this Article
V shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this
Article V shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person
who is not specified in Article V but whom the Corporation has the power
or obligation to indemnify under applicable law, or otherwise. _ARTICLE VI_

 _Section_ __ _ 6.04_. _Notices and Mailing_. Except as otherwise provided in
the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, all notices
required to be given by any provision of these By-laws shall be deemed to have
been given effectively if given in person or by telephone, mail addressed to
the recipients address as it appears on the records of the Corporation,
facsimile, email or by other means of electronic transmission.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.05_. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to
be given under the DGCL or the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
or these By-laws, a waiver thereof, in writing signed by, or by electronic
transmission by, the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before
or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice and such meeting
except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting,
at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the
ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need to be
specified in any waiver of notice.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.06_. _Amendment of By-laws_.

 

These By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed or new By-laws may be
adopted at any meeting of the Board of Directors. The fact that the power to
amend, alter, repeal or adopt the Bylaws has been conferred upon the Board of
Directors shall not divest the stockholders of the same powers. _EXHIBIT C_

 

Forum Selection Bylaw

See attached. ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.01 _Forum for Certain Actions_. Unless a majority of the Board of
Directors, acting on behalf of the Corporation, consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another
state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state
court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive
forum for, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction with regard to, (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii)
any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current
or former director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a
claim against the Corporation or any of its current or former directors,
officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Corporation or these By-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against
the Corporation or any of its current or former directors, officers or other
employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware,
in all cases subject to the courts having personal jurisdiction over all
indispensible parties named as defendants. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of this Section 10.01 is filed in a court other
than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "Foreign Action") in the
name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have notice of
this Section 10.01 and to have consented to (i) the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of
Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce
this Section 10.01 (an "Enforcement Action") and (ii) having service of
process made upon such stockholder in any such Enforcement Action by service
upon such stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such
stockholder. Failure to enforce the provisions of this Section 10.01 would
cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled
to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the provisions of this Section 10.01.
