     2.1  The Separation and Redemption


     (a)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned on the
reasonable determination by Parent that all of the conditions in Article VII
hereof to the obligation of Parent and Spinco to effect the Merger have been, or
will immediately thereafter be, satisfied, Parent shall transfer the HDD
Business to Spinco and thereafter redeem the HDD Common Stock in exchange for
Spinco Common Stock by means of the Separation and the Redemption in a tax-free
transaction. The Separation and the Redemption shall be effected in accordance
with Section 2.4 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Separation
Documents and on such other terms (including, without limitation, any amendments
to the charter documents of Spinco) as are reasonably satisfactory, in form and
substance, to Parent and Company, as well as in compliance with all applicable
Laws.

     (b)  No certificates representing shares of Spinco Common Stock shall be
issued to former holders of record of shares of HDD Common Stock in connection
with the Redemption. Instead, an entry shall be made in the books and records of
Parent (or the transfer agent for HDD Common Stock) to reflect the entitlement
of each such former holder of record of shares of HDD Common Stock to an equal
number of shares of Spinco Common Stock, in exchange and replacement for such
shares of HDD Common Stock, as a result of the Redemption. Without the need for
any action by Parent, Spinco or former holders of Certificates, upon the
Redemption all Certificates shall, for all purposes (including the provisions of
Section 2.8 hereof), be deemed to represent a number of shares of Spinco Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of HDD Common Stock represented thereby
immediately prior to the Redemption.

the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Spinco, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Spinco shall continue as the
surviving corporation of

                                      -13-

corporation after the Merger, Spinco is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."

     2.3  Effective Time; Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing (or such later time as may
be agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate
of Merger) being referred to herein as the "Effective Time") as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined below). The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to be specified by
the parties hereto, which time and date shall be no later than the 5th business

mutually agree in writing (the date upon which the Closing actually occurs being
referred to herein as the "Closing Date").

shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Spinco and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of Spinco and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     2.5  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation.

          (a)  Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Spinco shall be amended and restated to read in

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

          (a)  Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors of Company effective
as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of seven

Agreement, Parent has designated Michael Brown as its director. If Mr. Brown is

          (a)  Spinco Common Stock.

               (i)  Each share of Spinco Common Stock to which a pre-Redemption
holder of record of shares of HDD Common Stock became entitled in the Redemption
(other than any shares of Spinco Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.7(a)(ii) hereof) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted (subject to Sections 2.7(a)(iii) and Section 2.7(a)(iv) hereof) into
the right to receive 1.52 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Company Common Stock,
upon the surrender of the applicable Certificate in the manner provided in
Section 2.8 hereof (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
Section 2.10 hereof); provided, however, that the Company, may, by written
notice given to Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time, increase the
Exchange Ratio to the extent that it determines such increase to be necessary or
advisable in order to have reasonable assurance that the shares of Company
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will, in the aggregate, represent at
least 50.1%, and in the Board's sole discretion up to not more than 51%, of the
combined voting power of all shares of Company Common Stock that will be
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

               (ii)   Each share of Spinco Common Stock held in the treasury of
Parent, or owned by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or any consideration therefor.

               (iii)  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Spinco Common Stock or Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

               (iv)   No fraction of a share of Company Common Stock shall be
issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each pre-Redemption holder
of record

                                      -15-
<PAGE>   20

of shares of HDD Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Company Common Stock as a result of the Merger (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Company Common Stock to be received by such
holder) shall receive from Company an amount of cash (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) such fraction, by (y) the average closing price of one (1) share
of Company Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market.

               (v)    Each of the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.8(a)
hereof) and Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise deliverable in connection with the Merger to any holder
or former holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under the Code or any other
applicable provision of Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been delivered or otherwise paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been delivered or paid in connection with the Merger pursuant to
this Agreement.


          (b)  Parent Stock Option Plans and Stock Options. Each option to
purchase HDD Common Stock held by a Transferred Employee under the Parent Stock
Option Plans outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be assumed by Company in
accordance with Section 6.10 hereof.


          (c)  Parent Convertible Notes.  Pursuant to a supplemental indenture
reasonably satisfactory, in form and substance, to Parent and Company and
executed at the Closing, Company shall become obligated, upon conversion of any
of Parent's 7% convertible notes after the Effective Time, to issue to the
holder thereof a number of shares of Company Common Stock calculated (in
accordance with the Exchange Ratio) to reflect the number of shares of HDD
Common Stock that would have been issued to such holder if such holder had
converted such note immediately before the Effective Time.

          (d)  Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for one (1) duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any

condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Company or any agent designated by
Company any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock in any name other than that of

satisfaction of Company or any agent designated by it that such tax has been

design, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of the products or services
of Company and its Subsidiaries (including products currently under development)
has not, does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual
Property of any third party or, to the knowledge of Company, constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction.

          (h)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice
from any third party that the operation of the business of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any act, product or service of Company or any of its

sale or disposition of Company Intellectual Property.

          (l)  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any
license, sublicense or other agreement relating to material Company Intellectual
Property. Neither the execution of this Agreement or any ancillary agreement
contemplated hereby nor the consummation of the Merger will contravene, conflict
with or result in an impairment of Company's right to own or use any of the
material Company Intellectual Property or any intellectual property of any third
party.

          (m)  To the knowledge of Company, it has at all times been Company's
practice and procedure to require all employees of Company and its Subsidiaries
to execute an agreement (containing no exceptions or exclusions from the scope
of its coverage) regarding the protection of proprietary information and the

performed for Company by such employees, the current form of which has been

     3.12  Compliance; Permits; Restrictions.

          (a)   Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with,
or in default or violation of (i) any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties and assets are bound or affected; or (ii) any material

conflicts, defaults or violations which, neither individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. To the knowledge of Company, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority is pending or threatened against Company or its
Subsidiaries, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to
conduct the same, except for investigations which, neither individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. There is no material agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any business
practice of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of material
property by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by
Company and any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or currently proposed
to be conducted.

               (b)  Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities for
the operation of its respective business of Company, failure to hold which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company (collectively, the "Company Permits").
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of the Company Permits.

     3.13  Litigation.  There are no Actions pending, or as to which Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of assertion nor, to the
knowledge of Company, is there a threatened Action against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company, or which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent,
enjoin, alter or delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

     3.14   Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Except for fees payable to Salomon Smith
Barney pursuant to an engagement letter, dated September 26, 2000, a copy of
which has been provided to Parent, Company has not incurred, nor will it incur,
directly or

                                      -27-
<PAGE>   32

indirectly, any Liability for brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions
or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     3.15   Employee Benefit Plans.

            (a)   Section 3.15(a) of the Company Schedules contains a complete
and accurate list of all employee compensation, incentive, fringe or benefit
plans, programs, policies, commitments, agreements or other arrangements
(whether or not set forth in a written document and including, without
limitation, all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) covering any active or former employee, director or consultant of Company
("Company Employee" which shall for this purpose mean an employee of Company or
a Code Affiliate of Company), any Subsidiary of Company, or with respect to
which Company has or, to its knowledge, may in the future have Liability
(collectively, the "Company Plans"). Company has provided or will make available
to Parent prior to the Closing: (i) true and complete copies of all documents
embodying each Company Plan including, without limitation, all amendments
thereto, all trust documents related thereto, and all material written
agreements and contracts relating to each such Company Plan; (ii) the most
recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in
connection with each Company Plan; (iii) the most recent summary plan
description together with the summary(ies) of material modifications thereto, if
any, required under ERISA with respect to each Company Plan; (iv) all IRS
determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters relating to each
Company Plan; (v) all material correspondence to or from any Governmental
Authority relating to each Company Plan; (vi) all forms and related notices
required under the COBRA; (vii) the most recent discrimination tests for each
Company Plan; (viii) the most recent actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for
each Company Plan; (ix) if the Company Plan is funded, the most recent annual
and periodic accounting of the Company Plan assets; and (x) all material
communication to Company Employees relating to any Company Plan and any proposed
Company Plan, in each case, relating to any amendments, terminations,
establishments, increases or decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or
vesting schedules, or other events which would result in any material liability
to Company or any Code Affiliate.

     (b)    Each Company Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all Laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Company Plans. No Action (excluding claims
for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Company Plan activities) has
been brought, or to the knowledge of Company, is threatened, against or with
respect to any Company Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened by the IRS or the DOL with
respect to any Company Plans. All contributions, reserves or premium payments
required to be made or accrued as of the date hereof to the Company Plans have
been timely made or accrued. Any Company Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section
501(a) of the Code (i) has either obtained a favorable determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified
status from the IRS or still has a

                                      -28-
<PAGE>   33

remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination; and (ii) incorporates or has been
amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act
of 1986, as amended. To the knowledge of Company, no condition or circumstance
exists giving rise to a material likelihood that any such Company Plan would not
be treated as qualified by the IRS. Company does not have any plan or commitment
to establish any new Company Plan, to modify any Company Plan (except to the
extent required by applicable Law or the applicable Company Plan or to conform
any such Company Plan to the requirements of any applicable Law, in each case as
previously disclosed to Parent in writing, or as required by the terms of this
Agreement), or to enter into any new Company Plan. Each Company Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent, Company or any of its
Code Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses).

               (c)   Neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
Code Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code and at no time has Company contributed to or been
requested to contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined
under ERISA. Neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer or
director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
Liability or penalty under Section 4975 through 4980B of the Code or Title I of
ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section
4975 of the Code and Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
Company Plan which could subject Company or its Affiliates to material
Liability.

          (d)   None of the Company Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable
Law, and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has represented, promised
or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits
to any Company Employee, former employee, director, consultant or other person,
except to the extent required by applicable Law.

          (e)   Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by or
subject to (and none of its respective properties or assets is bound by or
subject to) any arrangement with any labor union. No employee of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is represented by any labor union or covered by any
collective bargaining agreement and, to the knowledge of Company, no campaign to
establish such representation is in progress. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened labor dispute involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any group of its employees nor has Company or any of its
Subsidiaries experienced any labor interruptions over the past three (3) years,
and Company and its subsidiaries consider their relationships with their
employees to be good. Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable material Laws respecting employment, employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours.

               (f)  Neither the execution and delivery by Company of this
Agreement or the Separation Documents, nor the performance by Company of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, nor the consummation by Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any stockholder, director or Company Employee or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan or otherwise; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan; or (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

               (g)  Each Company International Employee Plan (as defined below)
has been established, maintained and administered in material compliance with
its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
Laws that are applicable to such Company International Employee Plan.
Furthermore, no Company International Employee Plan has unfunded Liabilities
that, as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully
accrued. Except as required by applicable Law, no condition exists that would
prevent Company or Parent from terminating or amending any Company International
Employee Plan at any time for any reason. For all purposes of and under this
Agreement, "Company International Employee Plan" means each Company Plan that
has been adopted or maintained by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
informally or formally, for the benefit of current or former employees of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United States.

          3.16   Absence of Liens. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets
(real, personal and mixed) used in its business, free and clear of any Liens,
except (i) Liens reflected in the Company Financial Statements; (ii) Liens for
Taxes not yet due and payable; and (iii) Liens which are not material to Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          3.17    Environmental Matters.

                  (a) (i) To the knowledge of Company, Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with and have been in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws (which compliance includes, but is not limited to,
the possession by Company and its Subsidiaries of all permits and other
governmental authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof), except where failures to be
in compliance would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company. Since December 31, 1997, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any communication (written or oral),
whether from a Governmental Authority, citizens' group, employee or otherwise,
alleging that Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in such compliance,
except where failures to be in compliance would not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

(ii) There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
     threatened against Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the

                                      -30-
<PAGE>   35
knowledge of the Company, against any entity or business whose liability for
any Environmental Claim Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

                 (iii)   There are no present or, to the knowledge of
Company, past actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or
incidents, including, without limitation, the release or presence of any
Hazardous Material that could form the basis of any Environmental Claim against
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Company, against any
entity or business whose liability for any Environmental Claim Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by
operation of law that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

            (b)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any indemnity or other agreement relating to liability under any Environmental
Laws or relating to Hazardous Materials, except for indemnity or similar
provisions contained in Company contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     3.18   Labor Matters. There are no material controversies pending or, to
the knowledge of Company, threatened, between Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective employees. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by
Company or its Subsidiaries nor does Company know of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees. As of the date of
this Agreement, Company has no knowledge of any strikes, slowdowns, work
stoppages or lockouts, or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     3.19   Agreements, Contracts and Commitments.

            (a)    Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by:

                   (i)   any employment or consulting agreement, contract or
commitment with any executive officer or member of the Board of Directors of
Company, other than those that are terminable by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on no more than thirty (30) days' notice without Liability or
financial obligation to Company;

                   (ii)  any agreement or plan, including, without limitation,
any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan or stock purchase plan, any
of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of benefits of which
will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

                                      -31-
<PAGE>   36

                 (iii)  any agreement of indemnification or any guaranty other
than any agreement of indemnification entered into in connection with the sale
or license of products or services in the ordinary course of business;

                 (iv)   any agreement, contract or commitment containing any
covenant limiting in any respect the right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to engage in any line of business or to compete with any person or granting any
exclusive distribution rights;

                 (v)    any agreement, contract or commitment currently in force
relating to the disposition or acquisition by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the date of this Agreement of a material amount of assets not in the
ordinary course of business or pursuant to which Company has any material
ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business enterprise other than its Subsidiaries; or

                 (vi)   any mortgages, indentures, guarantees, loans or credit
agreements, security agreements or other agreements or instruments relating to
the borrowing of money or extension of credit.

           (b)   Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
knowledge of Company any other party to a Company Contract (as defined below),
is in breach, violation or default under, and neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under, any of the material terms or conditions of any of the
agreements, contracts or commitments to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound that are
required to be disclosed in the Company Schedules pursuant to this Agreement
(any such agreement, contract or commitment, a "Company Contract") in such a
manner as would permit any other party to cancel or terminate any such Company
Contract, or would permit any other party to seek material damages or other
material remedies (for any or all of such breaches, violations or defaults, or
all of them in the aggregate).

     3.20  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Other Filings. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in Section 6.1
hereof) will at the time it is declared or ordered effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 6.1 hereof)
shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders
of Company and the stockholders of Parent, at the time of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1 hereof) or the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1 hereof) and at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
false or misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary

solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders' Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting which has become false or misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder that are
applicable by reason of the Proxy Statement constituting a proxy statement of
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub which
is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

     3.21   Board Approval.  The Board of Directors of Company has, as of the
date of this Agreement, made the determinations set forth in the fifth recital
to this Agreement.

     3.22   State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of Company has
approved the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such approval is sufficient to
render inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Related
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby the provisions
of Section 203 of Delaware Law to the extent, if any, such section is applicable
to the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Merger,
this Agreement, the Company Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, with the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and property and to carry on its business as now being conducted and
as currently proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to conduct business
and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the

<PAGE>   38

     4.2    Charter Documents.  Parent and Spinco have delivered or made
available to Company a true and complete copy of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent and the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Spinco and similar governing charter instruments of each of its
Significant Subsidiaries, each as amended to date, and each such instrument is
in full force and effect. None of Parent or Spinco, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent governing charter instruments.

     4.3    Capital Structure.

            (a)    The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of

shares; and (ii) 5,253,591 shares were available for future grant. All shares of

and conditions set forth in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
would be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

each outstanding option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock as of September

subject to each such option, the exercise price of each such option, the number
of shares as to which each such option was vested as of such date, the vesting
schedule for each such option and whether the exercisability of each such option
will be accelerated in any way as a result of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for any other reason, and
indicates the extent of acceleration, if any.

     (b)    At the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of Spinco will
consist of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share. At the
Effective Time, the number of shares of Spinco Common Stock which are issued and
outstanding shall be equal to the number of shares of HDD Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Redemption (the "Spinco Common Stock")
and no shares of Preferred Stock will be issued and outstanding. All outstanding
shares of

                                      -34-

or other instrument to which Spinco is a party or by which Spinco or its
properties or assets are bound. All shares of Spinco Common Stock subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions set forth in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized and

          (c)  There are no equity securities, partnership interests or other
similar ownership interests of any class or series of capital stock of Parent,
or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such
equity securities, partnership interests or other similar ownership interests
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except for securities Parent owns,
directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, there are no equity
securities, partnership interests or other similar ownership interests of any
class or series of capital stock of any Subsidiary of Parent, or any securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such equity securities,
partnership interests or other similar ownership interests issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are no options, warrants, equity securities,
partnership interests or other similar ownership interests, calls, rights

<PAGE>   46

with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
any of their respective properties and assets are bound or affected; or (ii) any

HDD Business. To the knowledge of Parent, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority is pending or threatened against Parent or its

conduct the same, except for investigations which, neither individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the HDD Business or Spinco. There is no material agreement, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
impairing any business practice of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any

will hold upon the consummation of the Separation) all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities for
the operation of the HDD Business, failure to hold which would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the HDD Business or Spinco (collectively, the "Parent Permits"). Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the
Parent Permits.

     4.13      Litigation.  There are no Actions pending, or as to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of assertion nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, is there a threatened Action against Parent or any of its

Effect on Spinco, or which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin,
alter or delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as is not material to Spinco.

(whether or not set forth in a

                                      -42-
<PAGE>   47

written document and including, without limitation, all "employee benefit plans"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) covering any active or former
employee, director or consultant of Parent to be transferred in the Separation
to Spinco ("Parent Employee" which shall for this purpose mean an employee of
Parent or a Code Affiliate of Parent to be transferred in the Separation to
Spinco), any Subsidiary of Parent, or with respect to which Parent has or, to
its knowledge, may in the future have Liability, (collectively, the "Parent
Plans"). Parent has provided or will make available to Company prior to the
Closing: (i) true and complete copies of all documents embodying each Parent
Plan including, without limitation, all amendments thereto, all trust documents
related thereto; and all material written agreements and contracts relating to
each such Parent Plan; (ii) the most recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and
all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under
ERISA or the Code in connection with each Parent Plan; (iii) the most recent
summary plan description together with the summary(ies) of material
modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each Parent
Plan; (iv) all IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters
relating to each Parent Plan; (v) all material correspondence to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to each Parent Plan; (vi) all forms and related

Parent Plan, in each case, relating to any amendments, terminations,
establishments, increases or decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or
vesting schedules, or other events which would result in any material liability
to Parent or any Code Affiliate.

               (b)  Each Parent Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all Laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Parent Plans. No Action (excluding claims for
benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Parent Plan activities) has been
brought, or to the knowledge of Parent, is threatened, against or with respect
to any Parent Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened by the IRS or the DOL with respect to any
Parent Plans. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be
made or accrued as of the date hereof to the Parent Plans have been timely made
or accrued. Any Parent Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code (i) has
either obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination; and (ii) incorporates or has been
amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 and subsequent legislation. To the knowledge of Parent, no condition or
circumstance exists giving rise to a material likelihood that any such Parent
Plan would not be treated as qualified by the IRS. Parent does not have any plan
or commitment to establish any new Parent Plan, to modify any

                                      -43-
<PAGE>   48

Parent Plan (except to the extent required by applicable Law or the applicable
Parent Plan or to conform any such Parent Plan to the requirements of any
applicable Law, in each case as previously disclosed to Company in writing, or
as required by the terms of any Parent Plan or this Agreement), or to enter into
any new Parent Plan. Each Parent Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without
liability to Company, Parent or any of its Code Affiliates (other than ordinary
administration expenses).

               (c)  Neither Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
Code Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code and at no time has Parent contributed to or been
requested to contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined
under ERISA. Neither Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer or
director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
Liability or penalty under Section 4975 through 4980B of the Code or Title I of
ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section
4975 of the Code and Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
Parent Plan which could subject Parent or its Affiliates to material Liability.

               (d)  None of the Parent Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by
applicable Law, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree
benefits to any Parent Employee, former employee, director, consultant or other
person, except to the extent required by applicable Law.

               (e)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by or
subject to (and none of its respective properties or assets is bound by or
subject to) any arrangement with any labor union. No employee of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is represented by any labor union or covered by any
collective bargaining agreement and, to the knowledge of Parent, no campaign to
establish such representation is in progress. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened labor dispute involving Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and any group of its employees nor has Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries experienced any labor interruptions over the past three (3) years,
and Parent and its subsidiaries consider their relationships with their
employees to be good. Parent is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable material Laws respecting employment, employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours.

               (f)  Neither the execution and delivery by Parent of this
Agreement or the Separation Documents, nor the performance by Parent of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder, or the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any stockholder, director or Parent Employee or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Parent Plan or otherwise,

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   49

(ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent Plan,
or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits.

               (g)  Each Parent International Employee Plan (as defined below)
has been established, maintained and administered in material compliance with
its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
Laws that are applicable to such Parent International Employee Plan.
Furthermore, no Parent International Employee Plan has unfunded Liabilities
that, as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully
accrued. Except as required by applicable Law, no condition exists that would
prevent Parent or Company from terminating or amending any Parent International
Employee Plan at any time for any reason. For all purposes of and under this
Agreement, "Parent International Employee Plan" means each Parent Plan covering
employees to be transferred in the Separation to Spinco that has been adopted or
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether informally or formally,
for the benefit of current or former employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries outside the United States.

     4.16      Absence of Liens.  Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has good
and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets
(real, personal and mixed) used in the HDD Business, free and clear of any
Liens, except (i) Liens reflected in the Parent Financial Statements; (ii) Liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable; and (iii) such Liens as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the HDD Business.

     4.17      Facilities.  Section 4.19 of the Parent Schedules provides an
accurate and complete list of any facility or real property, including without
limitation, any improvement, equipment, structure, building or fixture that is
currently owned, used, occupied, controlled or rented in connection with the HDD
Business (collectively, the "Parent Facilities"), and Parent has provided
Company true and complete copies of all leases, licenses or other agreements
relating to Parent's use or occupancy of the Parent Facilities (collectively,
the "Parent Leases"). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
knowledge of Parent any other party to a Parent Lease, is in material breach,
violation or default under, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under, any
of the terms or conditions of any Parent Lease.

     4.18      Sufficiency of HDD Assets and Parent Intellectual Property. The
Parent Intellectual Property constitutes and includes all of the Intellectual
Property used in the HDD Business, or necessary for the conduct of the HDD
Business, as the HDD Business is currently conducted. The HDD Assets, together
with the Parent Intellectual Property and the rights conferred under the
contracts assigned to (or the economic benefits of which are conferred on)
Spinco in the Separation pursuant to the Separation Documents, constitutes and
includes all of the property and assets, tangible and intangible, and all
agreements and rights, used in the HDD Business, or necessary for the conduct of
the HDD Business, as the HDD Business is currently conducted.

     4.19      Environmental Matters.

               (a)  (i)   To the knowledge of Parent, the HDD Business is in
compliance and has been in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws
(which compliance includes, but is not limited to, the possession by the HDD
Business and its Subsidiaries of all permits and other governmental
authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with
the terms and conditions thereof), except where failures to be in compliance
would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Spinco or the HDD Business. Since December 31, 1997, neither Parent,
Spinco nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has received any communication
(written or oral), whether from a Governmental Authority, citizens' group,
employee or otherwise, indicating that the HDD Business is not in such
compliance, except where failures to be in compliance would not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco or
the HDD Business.

                    (ii)  There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against the HDD Business or, to the knowledge of
Parent, against any entity or business whose liability for any Environmental
Claim Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have retained, assumed or
been allocated, or that Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries may or will assume, be
allocated or otherwise acquire, that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco or the HDD
Business.

                    (iii) There are no present or, to the knowledge of Parent,
past actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents,
including, without limitation, the release or presence of any Hazardous Material
that could form the basis of any Environmental Claim against Parent (in
connection with the HDD Business), Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation or, to the knowledge of Parent, against any entity or
business whose liability for any Environmental Claim Spinco or any of its
Subsidiaries has or may have retained, assumed or been allocated, or that Spinco
or any of its Subsidiaries may or will assume, be allocated or otherwise
acquire, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

               (b)  Neither Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
indemnity or other agreement, or will after the Separation be subject to any
indemnity or other agreement, relating to liability under any Environmental Laws
or relating to Hazardous Materials, except for indemnity or similar provisions
contained in Parent Contracts that were entered into in the ordinary course of
Parent's business.

     4.20      Labor Matters. Except as would not be material to the HDD
Business, there are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective employees. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract applicable to persons employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries nor does Parent know of any activities or proceedings of any

                                      -46-
<PAGE>   51

labor union to organize any such employees. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no knowledge of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts,
or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

     4.21      Agreements, Contracts and Commitments.

               (a)  Except as would not be material to the HDD Business, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by:

                    (i)    any employment or consulting agreement, contract or
commitment with any officer or director or higher level employee or member of
the Board of Directors of Parent, other than those that are terminable by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries on no more than thirty (30) days' notice without
Liability or financial obligation to Parent;

                    (ii)   any agreement or plan, including, without limitation,
any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or
stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the
vesting of benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

                    (iii)  any agreement of indemnification or any guaranty
other than any agreement of indemnification entered into in connection with the
sale or license of products or services in the ordinary course of business;

                    (iv)   any agreement, contract or commitment containing any
covenant limiting in any respect the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to engage in any line of business or to compete with any person or granting any
exclusive distribution rights;

                    (v)    any agreement, contract or commitment currently in
force relating to the disposition or acquisition by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement of a material amount of assets not
in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to which Parent has any material
ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business enterprise other than its Subsidiaries; or

                    (vi)   any mortgages, indentures, guarantees, loans or
credit agreements, security agreements or other agreements or instruments
relating to the borrowing of money or extension of credit.

               (b)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
knowledge of Parent any other party to a Parent Contract (as defined below), is
in breach, violation or default under, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under, any of the material terms or conditions of any of the
agreements, contracts or commitments to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound that are

                                      -47-
<PAGE>   52

required to be disclosed in the Parent Schedules pursuant to this Agreement (any
such agreements, contracts or commitments are "Parent Contracts") in such a
manner as would permit any other party to cancel or terminate any such Parent
Contract, or would permit any other party to seek material damages or other
material remedies (for any of such breaches, violations or defaults, or all of
them in the aggregate).

     4.22      Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Other Filings.  None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement (as defined in
Section 6.1 hereof) will at the time it is declared or ordered effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 6.1
hereof) shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
stockholders of Parent and the stockholders of Company, at the time of the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1 of this Agreement) or
the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 6.1 of this Agreement)
and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not false or misleading, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Parent Stockholders' Meeting or the Company
Stockholders' Meeting which has become false or misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder that are
applicable by reason of the Proxy Statement constituting a proxy statement of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Company or Merger Sub which
is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

     4.23      Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Parent has, as of the
date of this Agreement, made the determinations set forth in the fourth recital
to this Agreement.

     4.24      State Takeover Statutes.  The Board of Directors of Parent has
approved the Merger, this Agreement, the Parent Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such approval is sufficient to
render inapplicable to the Merger, the Redemption, this Agreement, the Parent
Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby the
provisions of Section 203 of Delaware Law to the extent, if any, such section is
applicable to the Merger, the Redemption, this Agreement, the Parent Related
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies to or purports to
apply to the Merger, the Redemption, this Agreement, the Parent Related
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

     4.25      Fairness Opinion.  Parent has received a written opinion from
Lehman Brothers, dated as of the date hereof, to the effect that as of the date
hereof, the Exchange

                                      -48-
<PAGE>   53

Ratio is fair to the holders of HDD Common Stock from a financial point of view
and has delivered to Company a copy of such opinion.

(i) Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy

the stockholders of Parent in connection with the meeting of the stockholders of
Company to consider the approval of the Company Stockholder Proposal (the
"Company Stockholders' Meeting") and in connection with the meeting of the

comments of the SEC, use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared or ordered effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to its respective stockholders at the earliest practicable time. As
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Company and Parent shall prepare

Act. Each party hereto shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or for additional information, and shall supply the other party or
parties hereto with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. Each
party hereto shall comply in all material respects with all requirements of Law
applicable to such party in connection with the Proxy Statement and the

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to convene and hold the Company
Stockholders' Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting. Parent shall take all action

                                      -52-
<PAGE>   57

necessary in accordance with Delaware Law, the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and its Bylaws to convene the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, to be
held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effected under the Securities Act, for the purpose of voting upon the approval
of the Parent Stockholder Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders' Meeting on the same day and at the same
time as the Company Stockholders' Meeting. Subject to Section 6.2(c) and Section
6.2(d) hereof, Parent and Company shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
Company Stockholder Proposal, in the case of Company, and in favor of the
approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposal, in the case of Parent, and shall
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Requisite
Vote, in the case of Company's stockholders, and the Parent Requisite Vote, in
the case of Parent's stockholders, in each case as required by Delaware Law and
all other applicable legal requirements (including, without limitation, the
rules of Nasdaq, in the case of Company, and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange, in the case of Parent).

          (b)  Subject to Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.2(d) hereof: (i) the
Board of Directors of Company shall recommend that the stockholders of Company
vote in favor of approval of the Company Stockholder Proposal at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, and the Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend that
the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the approval of the Parent
Stockholder Proposal at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy
Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of
Company has recommended that the stockholders of Company vote in favor of
approval of the Company Stockholder Proposal at the Company Stockholders'
Meeting, and a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Parent has

Parent Stockholder Proposal at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii)
neither Board of Directors, nor any committee thereof, shall withdraw, amend or
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse
to the other party hereto, its respective recommendation.

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Company from
withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of
approval of the Company Stockholder Proposal by the stockholders of Company if
(i) a Company Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to Company and is not
withdrawn; (ii) neither Company nor any of its representatives shall have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.4(a) hereof; and (iii)
the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Offer, the
withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation is
necessary in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law.
Nothing contained in this Section 6.2(c) shall limit Company's obligation to
convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of whether the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn,
amended or modified). For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Superior Offer"

                                      -53-
<PAGE>   58

shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to
consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company, pursuant to which the stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the
equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) a
sale or other disposition by Company of assets (excluding inventory and used
equipment sold in the ordinary course of business) representing in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of Company's assets immediately
prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any person or group (including
by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Company), directly
or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, in each case
on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be more favorable to
the Company stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms of the
Merger; provided, however, that no such offer shall be deemed to be a Company
Superior Offer if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Company to be obtained by such third party
on a timely basis.

          (d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Parent from
withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of Parent if (i) a Parent Superior Offer (as defined below) is
made to Parent and is not withdrawn; (ii) neither Parent nor any of its
representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section
6.4(b) hereof; and (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that, in light of such Parent
Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such
recommendation is necessary in order for the Board of Directors of Parent to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2(d) shall limit Parent's
obligation to convene and hold the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of
whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent shall have been
withdrawn, amended or modified). For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent
Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a
third party to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving Parent, pursuant to which the holders of HDD
Common Stock immediately preceding such transaction hold less than fifty percent
(50%) of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (ii) a sale or other disposition by Parent of assets (excluding
inventory and used equipment sold in the ordinary course of business)
representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of assets
that would have been part of the HDD Business and transferred to Spinco if the
Separation had taken place; or (iii) the acquisition by any person or group
(including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by

                                      -54-

Parent), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire
beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of
the voting power of the then outstanding HDD Common Stock, in each case on terms
that the Board of Directors of Parent determines, in its reasonable judgment
(after consultation with its financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
Parent stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided, however, that no
such offer shall be deemed to be a Parent Superior Offer if any financing
required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
committed and is not likely, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Parent, to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

          (e)  Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, Parent or
their respective Boards of Directors from complying with Rule 14-2 and Rule 14d-
9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act with respect to a tender or
exchange offer made by a third party for any or their respective securities.

     6.3  Access to Information; Confidentiality.

          (a)  Each party hereto shall afford the other party hereto and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the properties, books, records and personnel of the other
party hereto during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of product development
efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of such party, as the
other party hereto may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained
in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b)  The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 14, 2000 (the

obligation under this Section 6.13(a) by purchasing one or more "tail" or "run-
off" policies providing the required coverage for such six-year period.

shall, nor shall either permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to, take or
cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to disqualify the

untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

<PAGE>   68

          (a)    As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Company and Parent each shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ, Notification and Report Forms relating to the Merger and
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by the HSR
Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to
by the parties hereto. Company and Parent each shall promptly (i) supply the
other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings; and (ii) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of
any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.
Each of Company and Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the early termination or expiration of the waiting periods applicable to
all such filings as soon as reasonably practicable.

          (b)    Each of Company and Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Law, each of Company and Parent shall cooperate and use all
commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such
Action.

     6.17 Separation Agreements. The parties will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to execute all agreements relating to the Separation in
substantially the forms attached hereto as Schedules 1 through 6.

     6.18 Employee Matters.

          (a)    Transferred Employees. Non-Transferred Employees. Within twenty
(20) days prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, Parent shall provide to
Company a list of all corporate employees providing services to the HDD Business
(the "Corporate HDD Employees") and all other employees primarily engaged in the
HDD Business up to a maximum of 2,600 individuals (the "Non-Corporate HDD
Employees"). Commencing not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Redemption
Date, Company shall notify Parent of the names of the Non-Corporate HDD
Employees and Corporate HDD Employees to whom Company (in its sole discretion)
and Spinco shall make written offers of employment (the "Spinco Offerees").
Spinco and the Company agree to hire the Spinco Offerees who accept their offer
of employment in writing. The Company agrees to hire, or be responsible for the
Approved Severance Costs (as provided in Section 6.18(b) below) of the Non-
Corporate HDD Employees and 535 Corporate HDD Employees provided that such
Corporate HDD Employees shall be identified by the Company in its sole
discretion ("Identified Corporate HDD Employees"). Parent agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company and Spinco with the
delivery of written offers of employment. Spinco Offerees and Identified
Corporate HDD Employees who accept their employment offers in writing and
commence work with Spinco or the Company pursuant to such offers shall be
referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." All other Non-Corporate HDD

                                      -64-
<PAGE>   69

Employees and Identified Corporate HDD Employees shall be referred to herein as
     "Non-Transferred Employees."

     (b)  Certain Terminations of Employment of Non-Transferred Employees. In
the event that any Non-Transferred Employee is terminated by Parent primarily
because of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement within thirty (30)
days prior to the Effective Time but after the signing of this Agreement, or in
the case of any Non-Transferred Employee who is terminated within nine (9)
months after the Effective Time (the "Discharge Period"), then the Company shall
be responsible for severance costs payable pursuant to the severance policy
agreed to by Parent and Company and attached as Schedule 6.18(b) of the Parent
Schedules (the "Approved Severance Costs") for such employee, provided, however,
that the aggregate number of Identified Corporate HDD Employees for whom Company
has responsibility to pay Approved Severance Costs shall not exceed 535 less the
number of Identified Corporate HDD Employees who are Transferred Employees.
Parent shall disclose to the Company the Non-Transferred Employees terminated or
to be terminated within the Discharge Period prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall withhold an amount equal to the Approved Severance Costs from the monies
otherwise transferable to Spinco pursuant to the transfer of the HDD Business as
specified in Section 2.1 hereof to pay for such Approved Severance Costs (the
"Severance Reserve"). Following the Discharge Period, Parent shall provide the
Company with a final accounting of the Approved Severance Costs associated with
terminations of employment of the Non-Transferred Employees (the "Actual
Severance"). Parent shall issue a check or an invoice to the Company for the
difference (including interest at 6.20%), if any, between the Severance Reserve
and the Actual Severance. Company agrees to pay Parent for fifty percent (50%)
(one hundred percent (100%) for Messrs. Gannon and Shoquist) of the severance
costs, up to the maximum Company payment reflected on Parent Schedule 6.18(b),
associated with the termination of employment of those members of Parent's
senior management team as agreed to and set forth on Parent Schedule 6.18(b)
("Identified Senior Management") that arise primarily due to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and which termination occurs within 9 months
following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any
member of Identified Senior Management (i) becomes employed by Company within
the Discharge Period, or (ii) rejects a Company employment offer within the
Discharge Period for a position with comparable pay and within forty (40) miles
of such member's current office location, the Company will not be required to
pay Parent for severance costs associated with such person. Except for the
Approved Severance Costs and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement,
the Company is not responsible or liable for any claim for severance benefits or
other cash or equity compensation under any severance plan, program, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or agreement covering severance or change of
control benefits between Parent and any individual providing services to Parent.

     (c)  Liability for Terminated Employees. Parent shall be responsible and
assume all liability for all notices, benefits or payments (other than those
required to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 6.18(b) above) due to any
Non-Transferred Employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments due
to any government

                                      -65-
<PAGE>   70

authority, pursuant to any applicable foreign, federal, state or local law,
common law, statute, rule or regulation with respect to the employment,
discharge or layoff of employees by Parent prior to the Effective Date,
including but not limited to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act and COBRA and any rules or regulations thereunder. Such severance benefits
shall be made consistent with the severance methodology for such individuals
discussed with the Company prior to the signing of this Agreement. The Company
and Spinco shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices,
benefits or payments due to any Transferred Employees, and all notices,
payments, fines or assessments due to any government authority, pursuant to any
applicable foreign, federal, state or local law, common law, statute, rule or
regulation with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by
the Company or Spinco after the Effective Time, including but not limited to the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and COBRA and any rules or
regulations thereunder.

          (d)    401(k) Plan-to-Plan Transfer. Parent and Company each covenant
and agree, as soon as administratively feasible following the Effective Time, as
follows: (i) to facilitate a plan-to-plan transfer of the account balances of
Transferred Employees in Parent's 401(k) plan; (ii) Parent agrees to provide the
Company with information concerning the Transferred Employees who are
participants in the Parent 401(k) Plan, including such participants' Parent
401(k) Plan account balances, vesting, outstanding loan balances, and any
additional information which may be necessary in order to administer a transfer
of assets; and (iii) Parent and the Company shall make reasonable efforts to
take any and all actions necessary to accomplish the plan-to-plan transfer as
soon as administratively feasible following the Effective Time.

    6.19  Affiliate Agreements. Parent will use commercially reasonably efforts
to cause its Affiliates to execute and deliver agreements with the Company in a
form customary for transactions of the nature of the Merger and reasonably
acceptable to both parties prior to the Closing.

     taking of such vote, a third party has publicly announced, and not publicly
     withdrawn, a Parent Acquisition Proposal and within twelve (12) months
     following the termination of this Agreement a Parent Acquisition (as
     defined below) is consummated; or

                          (2) if following the date hereof and prior to the

                   (iii)  Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Company would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain

reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3(c) at the prime rate
of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made. Payment of the fees described in this Section 8.3(c) shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement.

               (iv)   For the purposes of this Section 8.3, "Parent Acquisition"
means any of the following transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement): (A) a merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Parent pursuant to which the aggregate percentage equity interest in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction held by the former holders
of HDD Common Stock represents 50% or less of the aggregate equity interest in
Parent represented by their shares of HDD Common Stock immediately before the
transaction; (B) a sale or other disposition by Parent of assets representing in
excess of fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate fair market value of assets that
would have been part of the HDD Business and transferred to Spinco if the
Separation had taken place; or (C) the acquisition by any person or group
(including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Parent),
directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the voting
power of the HDD Common Stock then outstanding.

     8.4  Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

     8.5  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally permitted, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto; and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
right.
