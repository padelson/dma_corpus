ii  4     PLAN AND AGREEMENT OF MERGER   DATED AS OF   APRIL 30,
2001   AMONG   DEL WEBB CORPORATION,   PULTE CORPORATION   AND  
PULTE ACQUISITION CORPORATION    This is a Plan and Agreement of Merger
dated as of April 30, 2001 (the "Agreement"), among Del Webb Corporation (the
"Company"), a Delaware corporation, Pulte Corporation ("Pulte"), a Michigan
corporation, and Pulte Acquisition Corporation ("Acquisition"), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pulte.   WHEREAS, the Boards
of Directors of the Company and Pulte deem it advisable and in the best
interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders that the
Company and Pulte engage in a business combination in order to advance the
long-term strategic business interests of the Company and Pulte.   WHEREAS,
the combination of the Company and Pulte shall be effected by the terms of
this Agreement through a merger as outlined below (the "Merger").   WHEREAS,
in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and
Pulte have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 2.3), other than shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Pulte
or directly or indirectly by the Company, will be converted into the right to
receive shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Pulte ("Pulte
Common Stock") as set forth in Article I.   WHEREAS, as a condition to the
willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, William J. Pulte and
his affiliated trusts (collectively, the "Principal Stockholder") and the
Company have entered into a Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Voting Agreement"), providing, among other things, that the Principal
Stockholder will vote in favor of the Pulte Meeting Matters (as defined in
Section 3.2(b)).    5   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and this Agreement constitutes a plan of reorganization under the
Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   MERGER OF ACQUISITION AND THE COMPANY  
1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Acquisition will
be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). Except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, when the Merger becomes effective,
(i) the real and personal property, other assets, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of the Company will continue as
those of the Surviving Corporation, unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger,
(ii) the separate existence of Acquisition will terminate, and Acquisition\'s
real and personal property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers, purposes and franchises will be merged into the Surviving
Corporation, which will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Acquisition in accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) the Merger will have
the other effects specified in the DGCL (including, without limitation,
Section 259 of the DGCL).   1.2 Certificate of Incorporation. From the
Effective Time until subsequently amended in accordance with applicable law,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.3 By-Laws. The By-Laws of Acquisition as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation from the Effective Time until they are amended in
accordance with their terms, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable law.   1.4 Directors. The directors of
Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time and will serve in
accordance with the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are elected and qualified, or until such earlier time
as they resign or are removed in accordance with the By-Laws until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   1.5
Officers. The officers of the Company immediately before the Effective Time
will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
and will hold office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, and in
accordance with the By-Laws of the Surviving     2  6  Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be
an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.   1.6 Further Assurances. If at any time
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation determines or is advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, obligation, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either
the Company or Acquisition acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver all documents, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
Acquisition or otherwise, and to take all other actions and do all other
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, obligation, title and interest in, to and under such
rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   1.7 Stock of
the Company.   (a) Except as provided in Sections 1.7(e) and 1.7(f), at the
Effective Time each share of Company Common Stock which is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into and become the
right to receive, the number (the "Exchange Ratio") of shares of Pulte Common
Stock, described in Section 1.7(b) below (the "Merger Consideration").  
(b) The Merger Consideration for a share of Company Common Stock will be as
follows:   (i) If the Market Value (computed as provided in Section 1.7(c))
of a share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or greater than $33.00 but less
than $39.00, the Merger Consideration will be one share of Pulte Common Stock
for each share of Company Common Stock.   (ii) If the Market Value of a
share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or greater than $39.00 but less than
$45.04, the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock will
be the number of shares of Pulte Common Stock equal to $39.00 divided by the
Market Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock.   (iii) If the Market Value
of a share of Pulte Common Stock is equal to or greater than $45.04, the
Merger Consideration will be 0.866 shares of Pulte Common Stock for each
share of Company Common Stock.   (iv) If the Market Value of a share of
Pulte Common Stock is equal to or greater than $30.00 but less than $33.00,
the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock will be the
number of shares of Pulte Common Stock equal to $33.00 divided by the Market
Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock.     3  7   (v) If the Market
Value of a share of Pulte Common Stock is less than $30.00, the Merger
Consideration will be 1.1 shares of Pulte Common Stock for each share of
Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Market Value of a
share of Pulte Common Stock is less than $27.00, the Company will have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(j).   (c) The
"Market Value" of a share of Pulte Common Stock will be the average of the
Last Sale Price of a share of Pulte Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") for the fifteen trading days ending on and including
the third NYSE trading day prior to the day of the meeting at which the
stockholders of the Company vote upon the Merger. The "Last Sale Price" of
a share of Pulte Common Stock on a day will be the last sale price of a share
of Pulte Common Stock reported on the NYSE consolidated tape prior to 4:00
p.m. on that day.   (d) As a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as provided herein or
by law.   (e) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company, by Pulte or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company or Pulte immediately before the Effective Time will, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and cease to exist and no payment will be made
with respect to any of those shares.   (f) No fractional shares of Pulte
Common Stock will be issued as a result of the Merger. Any holder of Company
Common Stock who, but for this Section 1.7(f), would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Pulte Common Stock as a result of the Merger will
receive, instead of that fraction of a share, cash equal to the result of (i)
the Last Sale Price on the Merger Date (as defined in Section 2.1) times (ii)
the fraction.   1.8 Stock of Acquisition. At the Effective Time, each share
of stock of Acquisition ("Acquisition Stock") which is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, a certificate which represented
Acquisition Stock will automatically become and be a certificate representing
the number of shares of the Surviving Corporation common stock into which the
Acquisition Stock represented by the certificate was converted.   1.9
Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Pulte Common Stock are
changed into a different number of shares by reason of a reclassification,
recapitalization, split up, combination or exchange of shares, or any
dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to the
Company Common Stock or Pulte Common Stock with a record date between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
will be adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as that contemplated     4  8  by this Agreement if
the reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend had not taken place.   1.10 Distributions with Regard to Company
Common Stock.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition and the Company
will jointly designate a bank or trust company to act as Distributing Agent
in connection with the Merger (the "Distributing Agent"). Immediately before
the Effective Time, Pulte will provide the Distributing Agent with the shares
of Pulte Common Stock which will have to be distributed to holders of
Company Common Stock under Section 1.7(a) and the cash required to make the
payments for fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.7(f).   (b) Until they
are distributed, the shares of Pulte Common Stock held by the Distributing
Agent will be deemed to be outstanding but the Distributing Agent will not
vote those shares or exercise any rights of a shareholder with regard to
them. If any dividends are paid with regard to shares of Pulte Common Stock
while they are held by the Distributing Agent, the Distributing Agent
will hold the dividends, uninvested, until shares of Pulte Common Stock
are distributed to particular former holders of Company Common Stock, at
which time the dividends which have been paid with regard to the shares of
Pulte Common Stock which are being distributed will be paid, without
interest, to the persons to whom the shares are being distributed.   (c)
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the
Distributing Agent to mail to each person who was a record holder of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates in order to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration. When the Distributing Agent receives a
Certificate, together with a properly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents, the Distributing Agent will
distribute to the holder of the Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the
letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration with regard to the shares
represented by the Certificate, and the Certificate will be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, the
surrendered Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer, and the person who surrenders the Certificate must provide
funds for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
distribution to a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that the tax has been paid. After the Effective Time, a Certificate which has
not been surrendered will represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (and any dividends paid after the Effective Time with regard to
shares of Pulte Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration), without
any interest.   (d) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Surviving Corporation will accept an affidavit and indemnification reasonably
satisfactory to it instead of the Certificate and will pay the Merger
Consideration to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock which had
been represented by the Certificate.     5  9   (e) At any time which
is more than six months after the Effective Time, Pulte may require the
Distributing Agent to deliver to it any shares of Pulte Common Stock which
had been made available to the Distributing Agent and have not been disbursed
to former holders of Company Common Stock and any dividends received by the
Distributing Agent in respect of such undisbursed Pulte Common Stock which
are then held by the Distributing Agent, and after the Pulte Common Stock and
dividends have been delivered to Pulte, former stockholders of the Company
must look to Pulte for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
the Certificates held by them. None of Pulte, the Surviving Corporation or
the Distributing Agent will be liable to any former stockholder of the
Company for any Merger Consideration which is delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (f) After the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not record any transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, and the stock ledger of the Company will be
closed. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
for transfer, they will be canceled and treated as having been surrendered
for the Merger Consideration described in Section 1.7(b).   1.11
Determinations Regarding Documents. The Company (or, after the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation) will have the discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part, to determine whether letters of transmittal accompanying
Certificates have been properly and timely completed, signed and submitted
and to determine whether or not to disregard immaterial defects in particular
letters of transmittal. The decision of the Company (or, after the Merger,
the Surviving Corporation) with regard to those matters will be conclusive
and binding. None of Pulte, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Distributing Agent will have any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in a letter of transmittal submitted to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Pulte, as applicable. The Distributing Agent or
another person or entity agreed to by the Company and Pulte will make all
computations contemplated by Section 1.7 and those computations will be
conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Common Stock.   1.12
Company Stock Options.   (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option (as defined in Section 3.1(f)) which is outstanding at the Effective
Time will accelerate and vest and at the election of the holder thereof (i)
will become the right to receive a sum in cash equal to (A) the amount, if
any, by which the per share exercise price of the option is less than the
Market Value of the Merger Consideration for a share of Company Common Stock,
times (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the option in full (irrespective of vesting provisions) or, (ii) if the
holder does not so elect, will be converted into an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Option
Plan (as defined in Section 3.1(f)) pursuant to which such Company Stock
Option was granted (but taking into account any changes thereto, including
the acceleration thereof, provided for in such Company Stock Option Plan or
in such option by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby), that number of shares of Pulte Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the
nearest whole share of Pulte Common Stock, at a     6  10  price per
share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share
exercise price specified in such Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange
Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code. If such holder has elected to receive cash, in order to receive
the amount to which the holder is entitled under this Section, the holder
must deliver to the Surviving Corporation prior to the date of the Company\'s
Merger Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 4.4) (i) any certificate
or option agreement relating to the option and (ii) a document in which the
holder acknowledges that the payment the holder is receiving is in full
satisfaction of any rights the holder may have under or with regard to the
option. Pulte will pay the cash amount due under this Section 1.12(a) to a
holder of a Company Stock Option promptly after the Merger and after the
Surviving Corporation receives from the holder the items described in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence. At the Effective Time, the restricted
stock of the Company will accelerate and vest in accordance with its
terms.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Pulte
shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plans (including that, in connection with the Merger and pursuant to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans, the Company Stock Options have
become fully vested and exercisable) and, unless the holder has elected to
receive cash, the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 1.12 after giving effect to the
Merger and the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan). To the
extent permitted by law, Pulte shall comply with the terms of the Company
Stock Option Plans and shall take such reasonable steps as are necessary or
required by, and subject to the provisions of, such Company Stock Option
Plans, to have the Company Stock Options which qualified as incentive stock
options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock
options of Pulte after the Effective Time.   (c) Pulte shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Pulte Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Company Stock
Options in accordance with this Section 1.12. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Pulte shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as
the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect
to the shares of Pulte Common Stock subject to such options and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals
who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements
under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), where applicable, Pulte shall administer the Company Stock
Option Plans in a manner consistent with the exemptions provided by Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   1.13 Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, no certificates representing shares of Pulte Common Stock
or cash shall be     7  11  delivered to a Person who may deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company in accordance with Section 4.9 hereof for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), until such Person has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement
(as defined in Section 4.9) to Pulte.   ARTICLE II   EFFECTIVE TIME OF
MERGER   2.1 Date of the Merger. Unless this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with Article VI, the day on which the
Merger is to take place (the "Merger Date") will be the first business day
after the day on which all the conditions set forth in Article V have been
satisfied or waived. The Merger Date may be changed with the consent of the
Company and Pulte.   2.2 Execution of Certificate of Merger. On the day
before the Merger Date, Acquisition and the Company will each execute a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), which will be in proper
form for filing under the DGCL, and deliver it to Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP for filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware. When
all the conditions in Article V have been satisfied or waived, Pulte and the
Company will (i) cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware on the Merger Date and (ii) cause all other
documents which must be recorded or filed as a result of the Merger to be
recorded or filed.   2.3 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger will
become effective when the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary
of State of Delaware, or at such other time and date as are agreed upon by
Pulte and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (that being
the "Effective Time").   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  
3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Pulte prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (each section
of which qualifies and is a correspondingly numbered representation
and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein), the Company
represents and warrants to Pulte and Acquisition as follows:   (a) Except
as set forth on Section 3.1-A of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
and each of its subsidiaries (each corporation or other entity of which a
company owns directly or indirectly 51% or more of the equity being a
"subsidiary" of that company), is an entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except
where the failures to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
have such power and authority, in the aggregate,     8  12  would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below)
on the Company, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership
or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary other than in
such jurisdictions where the failures so to qualify or to be in good
standing, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company which were previously furnished or
made available to Pulte are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" on a company means a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results of operations,
properties, assets, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of that
company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of that
company to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than a material adverse effect resulting from (A) a
change in laws, rules or regulations of governmental agencies, (B) a change
in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), (C)
a change or occurrence affecting the homebuilding industry generally, or (D)
a change in general economic conditions (including, without limitation, a
change in interest rates).   (b) The Company has all corporate power and
authority necessary to enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All corporate actions
necessary to authorize the Company to enter into this Agreement and carry out
the transactions contemplated by it, other than approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, have been
taken. This Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and is a valid
and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms.   (c) Except as set forth on Section 3.1-C of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or of any document to be delivered in accordance with this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by any document to be delivered in accordance with this
Agreement will violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Company, or (ii) any law, order, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity (as defined below) having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except, in the case of (ii), for violations, breaches, or
defaults which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the

Schedule delivered by Pulte to the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "Pulte Disclosure Schedule") (each section of which qualifies
and is a correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to
the extent specified therein), each of Pulte and Acquisition represents and
warrants to the Company as follows:   (a) Pulte and each of its
subsidiaries, including Acquisition, is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failures to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority, in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary other than in such
jurisdictions where the failures so to qualify or to be in good standing, in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Pulte. The copies of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of
Pulte which were previously furnished or made available to the Company are
true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date
of this Agreement. Acquisition is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pulte and has
engaged in no activities other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.     20  24   (b) Each of Pulte and
Acquisition has all corporate power and authority necessary to enable it to
enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All corporate actions necessary to authorize each of Pulte and
Acquisition to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions
contemplated by it, other than the approval of (i) the issuance of shares of
Pulte Common Stock in the Merger and (ii) the adoption of a stock option plan
(or the amendment of a Pulte Stock Option Plan) to allow for the conversion
of the Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.12 (collectively, the
"Pulte Meeting Matters") by the stockholders of Pulte, have been taken,
including all actions required to satisfy the conditions contained in Section
5.1(k). This Agreement has been duly executed by each of Pulte
and Acquisition and is a valid and binding agreement of each of Pulte
and Acquisition, enforceable against each of Pulte and Acquisition in
accordance with its terms.   (c) Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or of any document to be delivered in accordance with this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by any document to be delivered in accordance with this
Agreement will violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, (i) the Articles of Incorporation of Pulte or the Certificate
of Incorporation of Acquisition or the By-laws of either Pulte or
Acquisition, or (ii) any law, order, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over Pulte or any of its subsidiaries, including
Acquisition, except in the case of (ii), for violations, breaches,
or defaults which, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.   (d) Except as shown on Section 3.2-D
of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule or except as expressly contemplated herein,

Acquisition to fulfill all its obligations under this Agreement, other than
governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, consents or other
governmental actions the absence of which, in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.   (e) The Board of
Directors of Pulte, by resolutions duly adopted by the requisite vote of

Corporation Act ("MBCA"). To the knowledge of Pulte, except for Chapters 7A
and 7B of the MBCA (which have been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover

of Pulte or any other securities of Pulte other than issuances of

agreement that expressly limits the ability of Pulte or any of its
subsidiaries to compete in or conduct any line of business or compete with
any person or entity in any geographic area or during any period of time
except to the extent that any such limitations, in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.   (x)

Section 3.2-X(i) of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule (or as otherwise permitted
by this Agreement): (a) neither Pulte nor any ERISA Affiliate has any formal

amendments, modifications to, or adoptions of, any Pulte Benefit Plan that,
in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material

except shown on Section 3.2-X(ii) of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule or as, in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Pulte: (a) if intended to qualify under Section 401(a), 401(k) or

of fiduciary duty have occurred; (d) no non-exempt prohibited transaction
within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA has occurred; (e) as of the date

shown on Section 3.2-X(iv) of the Pulte Disclosure Schedule, neither Pulte
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liabilities under Title IV of ERISA
(including Sections 4063-4064 and 4069 of ERISA) that have not been satisfied
in full except as, in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material     29  33  Adverse Effect on Pulte or
that have not been reflected on Pulte\'s consolidated financial
statements.   (v) With respect to each Pulte Benefit Plan that is a
"welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), except as shown on

Pulte or any of its subsidiaries beyond their termination of employment,
other than (i) as may be required under Part 6 of Title I or ERISA, (ii) at
the expense of the participant or the participant\'s beneficiary, or (iii)
as, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Pulte.   (vi) Except with respect to payments under the
agreements and programs shown on Section 3.2-X(vi) of the Pulte Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not entitle any individual to severance pay or any tax "gross-up"
payments with respect to the imposition of any tax pursuant to Section 4999
of the Code or accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount, of compensation or benefits due to any individual with respect to any
Pulte Benefit Plan.   (vii) Except as shown on Section 3.2-X(vii) of the
Pulte Disclosure Schedule, there is no Pulte Benefit Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan", as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or
which is covered by Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.   (viii) Pulte has
furnished or made available to the Company, within a reasonable period prior
to the Effective Time, complete and accurate (in all material respects)
documentation with respect to all Pulte Benefit Plans, including, but not
limited to, plan documents, summary plan descriptions and other material
employee communications, benefit computations and methodologies, benefit
costs, participant lists, government filings, and funding status.   (y)
Pulte acknowledges that each of the executives of the Company listed on
Section 3.2-Y of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be entitled to, and
shall receive, upon consummation of the Merger payment of the
amounts provided for in each executive\'s respective employment or severance
agreement following a change of control and termination without cause, as
such terms are defined in such agreement. The foregoing acknowledgment does
not in any way create any inference that any of the Company\'s employees that
are not listed on Section 3.2-Y of the Company Disclosure Schedule do or do
not have similar rights.   (z) To the knowledge of Pulte, none of Pulte,
any of its subsidiaries or any directors, officers, agents or employees of
Pulte or any of its subsidiaries has (i) used any funds for unlawful
contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to
political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payments to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties
or campaigns or violated any provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
of 1977, as amended, or (iii) made any other unlawful payments, which, in the
case of (i), (ii), or (iii), in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Pulte.    30  34   ARTICLE IV

the subject of this Agreement, and each of them will take all reasonable
steps within its control (including providing information to the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice) to cause the waiting periods
required by the HSR Act to be terminated or to expire as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Pulte will each provide information and
cooperate in all other respects to assist the other in making its
filing under the HSR Act.   4.4 Stockholders\' Meetings. Each of Pulte and
the Company will take all action which is necessary in accordance with
applicable law and its Articles of Incorporation (Pulte) or Certificate of
Incorporation (the Company) and By-Laws to call and convene a special meeting
of its stockholders (each, a "Merger Stockholders Meeting") as soon as
practicable to consider and vote, in the case of the Company, upon adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and, in the case of Pulte,
approval of the Pulte Meeting Matters. The proxy statement distributed by
each of Pulte and the Company with respect to its Merger Stockholders Meeting
will include the recommendation of its Board of Directors that its
stockholders vote to adopt, in     34  38  the case of the Company,
this Agreement and approve the Merger, and, in the case of Pulte, the Pulte
Meeting Matters, unless the Board of Directors of Pulte or the Company has
determined, after consultation with its counsel, that such Board of Directors
is required by its fiduciary duties to state that it no longer recommends
that the stockholders of Pulte or the Company, as the case may be, vote in
favor of adoption of the Pulte Meeting Matters or this Agreement and
the Merger. Each of Pulte and the Company will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies or votes in favor
of adoption of, in the case of the Company, this Agreement and approval of
the Merger, and, in the case of Pulte, the Pulte Meeting Matters.   4.5
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.   (a) Pulte will prepare and
file with SEC as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 relating to the shares of Pulte Common
Stock to be issued as a result of the merger (the "Registration Statement").
The Registration Statement will include a joint proxy statement (the "Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus") of Pulte and the Company relating to the Merger
Stockholders Meetings. Pulte and the Company will cooperate to provide all
information which is required to be included in the Registration Statement or
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in a timely manner so the
Registration Statement can be filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably
practicable. Pulte will cause the Registration Statement, and Pulte and the
Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, to comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules under them. Pulte will use its
best efforts, and the Company will cooperate with Pulte, to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the staff of the SEC as
promptly as practicable after it is filed (including without limitation,
responding to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the
Registration Statement) and to keep the Registration Statement effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of Pulte and the Company
will, as promptly as practicable, provide to the other copies of any written
comments received from the SEC with regard to the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and will advise the other of any
comments with respect to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus which are received orally from the staff of the SEC.
Pulte will use its best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of
Registration Statement, any qualifications, permits or approvals which are
necessary under any state securities laws in order to carry out the Merger,
and Pulte will pay all expenses incident to obtaining those qualifications,
permits or approvals. Pulte will provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form
S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide the Company with a
copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of both parties,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations.   (b) Pulte and Acquisition each
represents and warrants to the Company, and the Company represents and
warrants to Pulte, that none of the information supplied by it for    
35  39  inclusion, or included in a document filed by it which is
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will (i) in the case of the Registration Statement and
each amendment, at the time the Registration Statement is filed or becomes
effective and at the Effective Time, and (ii) in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement to it, at the time it
is mailed to stockholders and at the time of the Merger Stockholders
Meetings, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If at any time before the Effective Time an event occurs with
respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with respect to Pulte
or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, which is required to be
described in the Registration Statement or in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be filed with the SEC
as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by law, will be
distributed to the stockholders of Pulte, the Company or both of them.
Neither Pulte nor the Company will make any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus without the
approval of the other, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld (and
will under no circumstances be withheld to the extent the amendment or
supplement is required to cause the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to comply with applicable law). Pulte will advise the
Company promptly after it receives notice that the Registration Statement has
become effective or that any supplement or amendment to it has been filed,
that any stop order relating to the Registration Statement has been issued,
or that the qualification or registration of the Pulte Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger under any state securities law has been
suspended, of any request by the staff of the SEC for an amendment of the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or of the
receipt of comments or requests for additional information from the staff of
the SEC or the response to any such comments or requests for
additional information.   (c) The Company and Pulte each will cause its
Merger Stockholders Meetings to be held not later than 45 days after the day
on which the Registration Statement becomes effective.   (d) The Company\'s
Board of Directors will not take any action, other than causing the Company
to terminate this Agreement if it is entitled to do so under Article VI,
which prevents the Company\'s stockholders from voting upon the Merger, and
Pulte\'s Board of Directors will not take any action, other than causing
Pulte to terminate this Agreement if it is entitled to do so under Article
VI, which prevents Pulte\'s stockholders from voting upon the Pulte Meeting
Matters.   4.6 No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from
Others.   (a) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will, and
the Company will use its best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries\'
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and
other agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
or disclosing information) any inquiry or the making of any offer or proposal
by any corporation, partnership, trust, person or other entity or group (a
"Third Party") with respect to, or that could     36  40  reasonably
be expected to lead to, any merger, consolidation, share acquisition, asset
purchase, share exchange, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer
or similar transaction involving the acquisition of all or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
at a whole, or a significant equity interest in (including by way of tender
offer), or a recapitalization or restructuring of, the Company or any of its
material subsidiaries (any of those transactions being a "Company
Acquisition Transaction"), or (ii) negotiate, explore or otherwise
communicate in any way with any Third Party with respect to any possible
Company Acquisition Transaction, or enter into, approve or recommend any
agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or
otherwise fail to consummate the Merger or any other of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided however, that the Company may, in
response to a proposal which was not solicited after the date of this
Agreement, furnish information to, and engage in discussions or negotiations
with, a Third Party, if, but only if, (A) the Company\'s Board of Directors
determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor, that
the Third Party is financially capable of completing the transaction which is
the subject of the proposal and that, if completed, that transaction would
result in greater value to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger and
would be more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger
and (B) before furnishing or disclosing any non-public information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, the Third Party, the Company
receives from the Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreements, each dated as of January 9, 2001, between
Pulte and the Company, which confidentiality agreement does not provide for
any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or any payments by the
Company. Nothing in this Section 4.6(a) will prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act with regard to a tender offer or an exchange offer or
prohibit the Company from selling assets or properties in the ordinary course
of business.   (b) The Company will (i) no later than the end of the first
business day after the Company receives an inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to a possible Company Acquisition Transaction or a request for non-
public information relating to the Company in connection with a possible
Company Acquisition Transaction or for access to its or any of its
subsidiaries, properties, books or records by any Third Party that informs
the Company\'s Board of Directors that the Third Party is considering making,
or has made, a proposal or offer with respect to a Company Acquisition
Transaction (any such inquiry proposal, offer or request being an
"Acquisition Proposal"), notify Pulte in writing of the inquiry, proposal,
offer or request, (ii) in that written notice, indicate in reasonable detail
the identity of the Third Party (including the name of the Third Party) and
the terms and conditions of the proposal or offer, (iii) promptly notify
Pulte of any determination by the Company\'s Board of Directors that the
Company should furnish information to, or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, any Third Party, and (iv) keep Pulte informed of the
progress of any discussions or negotiations with any Third Party.   (c) The
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than Pulte)
which have been conducted before the date of this Agreement with respect to
any possible Company Acquisition Transaction and will inform any such
parties of the Company\'s obligations under this Section 4.6.     37 
41    (d) Neither Pulte nor any of its subsidiaries will, and Pulte will
use its best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries\' respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and other
agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
or disclosing information) any inquiry or the making of any offer or proposal
by any Third Party with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any merger, consolidation, share acquisition, asset purchase, share
exchange, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction involving the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the
assets of Pulte and its subsidiaries, taken at a whole, or a significant
equity interest in (including by way of tender offer), or a recapitalization
or restructuring of, Pulte or any of its material subsidiaries, that would
impede, delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such merger, consolidation
or other transaction being a "Pulte Acquisition Transaction"), or (ii)
negotiate, explore or otherwise communicate in any way with any Third Party
with respect to any possible Pulte Acquisition Transaction, or enter into,
approve or recommend any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it
to abandon, terminate or otherwise fail to consummate the Merger or any other
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
4.6(d) will prohibit the Board of Directors of Pulte from complying with Rule
14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender offer or
an exchange offer or prohibit Pulte from selling assets or properties in the
ordinary course of business.   4.7 Pulte\'s and Acquisition\'s Efforts to
Fulfill Conditions. Pulte and Acquisition each will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 to be
fulfilled on or before the Merger Date.   4.8 Company\'s Efforts to Fulfill
Conditions. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 to be fulfilled on or before the

Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Pulte a letter identifying all
persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may be deemed at the time this
Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company,
"affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the
date thereof. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each
person identified on such list to deliver to Pulte not less than 30 days
prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit 4.9 hereto (an "Affiliate Agreement").   4.10
Consulting Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, the consulting

amount set forth thereon in full satisfaction of the Company\'s obligations
under such consulting agreement.   4.11 Directors. The Board of Directors of
Pulte has agreed to elect to the Board of Directors of Pulte, effective as of

Merger):   (a) By mutual written consent of the Company and Pulte.   (b)
By the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of

Date, if earlier.   (c) By Pulte (provided that Pulte is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein) if (i) it is determined that any of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement was not complete and
accurate in all material respects (or that any of those representations and

fault of the terminating party, the Merger Date is later than September 30,

provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.1(d) will not be available to any party whose failure to
perform or observe in any material respect any of its obligations under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger
Date to occur on or before that date.   (e) By either Pulte or the Company
if any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority issues
an order (other than a temporary restraining order), decree or ruling, or
takes any other action, restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger, and that order, decree, ruling or other action becomes final and
nonappealable.   (f) By either Pulte or the Company, if the stockholders of
the Company fail to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger at the

Company, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors, shall have determined in good faith that
approving and entering into an agreement in connection with a Company Bona

in a transaction more favorable to its stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however,
that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 6.1(i)
unless (i) the Company shall have provided Pulte with at least five business
days advance notice of such termination and (ii) concurrent with the
termination, the Company pays Pulte the fee required by Section 6.3(e). A
"Company Bona Fide Proposal" shall mean a Company Acquisition Proposal which

reasonably capable of being consummated by the person making the proposal,
taking into account regulatory, legal, financial and other relevant
matters.   (j) By the Company, if the Market Value of a share of Pulte

liability for any material breach of this Agreement which occurs before this
Agreement is terminated.     43  47   (b) In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either party pursuant to Section 6.1(f) or by Pulte
pursuant to Section 6.1(g), if the stockholders of the Company fail to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger at the Company\'s Merger Stockholders
Meeting, then so long as at the time of such termination Pulte is not in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, the Company shall make payment to Pulte (within five
business days of notice of demand for payment), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an aggregate of not more than $5 million for
reimbursement of reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Pulte
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon
presentation of reasonable documentation of such fees and expenses.   (c) In

Company shall consummate or enter into any agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal that would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company shall make
payment to Pulte (within five business days of notice of demand for payment)
by wire transfer of immediately available funds of a termination fee in the
amount of $32 million.   (e) In the event of termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(i), so long as at the time of such
termination Pulte is not in material breach of any representation, warranty,

benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) solely as a result of this
transaction; (B) to the extent possible under applicable plan documents, and
subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable insurers,

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to any claim,
liability, loss, damage, cost or expense (whenever asserted or claimed) based
in whole or in part, or arising in whole or in part out of, any act or
omission by that person at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with
that person\'s duties as a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to the same extent and on the same
terms (including with respect to advancement of expenses) provided in the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, or in any indemnification
agreements, in effect on the date of this Agreement. Pulte or the Surviving
Corporation will pay all reasonable expenses, including attorney\'s fees,
that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations of Pulte and the Surviving Corporation under this

and conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons who are
currently covered by the Company\'s policies and with carriers comparable in
terms of credit worthiness to those which have written the policies
maintained by the Company at the date of this Agreement and (ii) neither
Pulte nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to pay an annual premium
for that insurance in excess of three times the annual premium relating to
the year during which this Agreement is executed, but if they are not able to
maintain the required insurance for an annual premium for that amount, they
will purchase as much coverage as they can obtain for that amount.

Attention: Joseph J. Giunta  Facsimile No.: (213) 687-5600   9.11 Governing
Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed under, the substantive
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be
performed solely in such state.   9.12 Amendments. This Agreement may be
amended only by a document in writing signed by both the Company and Pulte,
at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company and Pulte, but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with
the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval.   9.13 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, some of which may be
signed by fewer than all the parties or may contain facsimile copies of pages
signed by some of the parties. Each of those counterparts will be deemed to
be an original copy of this Agreement, but all of them together will
constitute one and the same agreement.   9.14 Extension; Waiver. At any time
prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.     50 
54   9.15 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements, shall survive the Effective Time,
except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein
(including Section 9.3) that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Effective Time and this Article IX.   9.16
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   9.17 Submission
to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each of Pulte and the Company irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined
in the Chancery or other Courts of the State of Delaware, and each of Pulte
and the Company hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each of Pulte and the Company hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts
for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process (b) that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.   9.18
Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.   9.19 Section 16. Pulte, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to provide that, with respect to
each Section 16 Affiliate (as defined below), (i) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) any other dispositions of
the     51  55  Company\'s equity securities (including derivative
