                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of April 12,
2001, by and among ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),

with Parent, "Buyers"), and HORSESHOE GAMING HOLDING CORP., a Delaware

                                   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, Joliet, a wholly owned subsidiary of HGHC, is engaged primarily
in the business of casino gaming in Joliet, Illinois;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of JAC and Joliet, have
determined that a business combination between JAC and Joliet is in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders and accordingly have
agreed to effect the Merger provided for in this Agreement upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

        WHEREAS, Parent, the sole shareholder of JAC, has determined the Merger
to be in the best interest of JAC and has approved the Merger; and

        WHEREAS, HGHC, the sole shareholder of Joliet, has determined the Merger
to be in the best interest of Joliet and has approved the Merger.

                                   AGREEMENT:

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual
covenants, representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and for
the purpose of prescribing the terms and conditions of the Merger, and such
other provisions as are deemed necessary or desirable, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

        Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, JAC shall be merged with and into Joliet
in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois (the "Merger"). As a result
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of JAC shall cease and Joliet
shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

        Section 1.02 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger shall take place (a) at the offices of
Winston & Strawn, 35 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601 on such date as
is determined in accordance with Section 9.01 and


                                       2
<PAGE>   8

upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles VII and
VIII of this Agreement; or (b) at such other place, time and/or date as the
parties hereto may otherwise agree.

        Section 1.03 Effective Time. If all of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in this Article I have been fulfilled or waived as provided herein and
this Agreement shall not have been terminated as provided in Article X hereof,
the parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") to be properly executed and filed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Illinois and the terms of this Agreement on or before the Closing Date.
The parties hereto also shall take such further actions as may be required under
the laws of the State of Illinois in order to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois (the "Effective Time").

        Section 1.04 Legal Effect. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties
of, the merging corporations, as provided under applicable law and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

        Section 1.05 Merger Consideration. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the consideration to be received by HGHC from
Parent upon the consummation of the Merger shall be an aggregate amount,
calculated consistent with the methodology set forth in the sample calculation
attached as Schedule 1.05, (the "Merger Consideration") equal to: (a) FOUR
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($465,000,000), plus (b) Net Working Capital
(or the deficit in Net Working Capital if a negative number), minus (c) Existing
Debt, plus (d) the aggregate amount of cash expended on or after April 1, 2001
and prior to the Closing by Joliet for the purchase of assets or property that
are listed on Schedule 1.05(d) ("Capital Expenses"). For purposes of the
Closing, the Buyers and the Sellers shall make a good-faith estimate of the
Merger Consideration based upon the anticipated amounts of (x) Net Working
Capital and Existing Debt after a review of the most recent ascertainable
financial information of Joliet available three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and (y) Capital Expenses (the "Estimated Merger Consideration").
The Estimated Merger Consideration shall be paid by Parent at the Closing as
follows:

               (i) TWO MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED
SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS ($2,476,264) (the "Bonus Escrow"), which is equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the amount to fund the Retention Bonus Plan, will be
paid to the Escrow Agent to be held in trust in accordance with Section 1.08
below;

               (ii) THIRTEEN MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
($13,950,000) (the "Indemnification Escrow") will be paid to the Escrow Agent to
be held in trust in accordance with Section 1.09 below; and

               (iii) The difference obtained by subtracting the amount paid as
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above from the Estimated Merger Consideration
will be paid to HGHC at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with written wire


                                       3
<PAGE>   9

instructions to be provided by HGHC to Parent not later than one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date.

        Section 1.06 Merger Consideration Determination. The Surviving
Corporation shall prepare a statement of Net Working Capital, Existing Debt and
Capital Expenses as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement") within thirty
(30) days following the Closing Date so as to determine the Merger
Consideration. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the accounting principles applied in the
preparation of the historical financial statements of Joliet, based upon
Joliet's historical accounting principles and past practices including the use
of Joliet's methodology for establishing reserves for accounts receivable, slot
club liability, chip liability and any other account subject to estimate or
judgment. If, based on the Merger Consideration as finally determined by the
parties in accordance with this Section 1.06, (a) the Merger Consideration is in
excess of the Estimated Merger Consideration, then (i) Parent shall forthwith
pay the difference between the Merger Consideration and the Estimated Merger
Consideration to HGHC together with interest on the amount of such difference
from the Closing Date through the date of payment at a rate of nine percent (9%)
per annum; or (b) the Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then HGHC shall forthwith pay the difference between the
Estimated Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration to Parent together
with interest on the amount of such difference from the Closing Date through the
date of payment at a rate of nine percent (9%) per annum.

        HGHC shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement
from Surviving Corporation (the "Dispute Period") to dispute any of the elements
of the Closing Statement (a "Dispute"). If HGHC does not give written notice of
a Dispute (a "Dispute Notice") within the Dispute Period to Parent, then the
Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by HGHC in
the form in which it was delivered by the Surviving Corporation and shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any Dispute Notice issued by HGHC
shall set forth in reasonable detail the elements and amounts with which it
disagrees. During the fifteen (15) day period following receipt by Parent of
such Dispute Notice, Parent and HGHC shall attempt to resolve such Dispute and
agree in writing upon the final content of the disputed Closing Statement and
the appropriate Merger Consideration adjustment based thereon.

        If Parent and HGHC are unable to resolve any Dispute within the fifteen
(15) day period after Parent's receipt of a Dispute Notice, then the parties
shall engage Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T"), or, if D&T is unable to serve , then
Parent and HGHC shall by mutual agreement select another nationally recognized
certified public accounting firm who is not rendering (and during the preceding
two (2) year period has not rendered) services to Parent or HGHC or any of their
respective Affiliates, to act as arbitrators (the "Arbitrating Accountant") to
settle such Dispute as soon as practicable. In connection with the resolution of
any Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant shall have access to all documents,
records, work papers, facilities and personnel necessary to perform its function
as arbitrator and shall be authorized by both parties to follow such procedures
and the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association
which in the sole exercise of its professional judgment shall be deemed
appropriate. HGHC and Parent shall have all reasonable rights to discovery in
connection with the arbitration pursuant to the federal rules of civil
procedure. The Arbitrating Accountant's award with respect to any


                                       4
<PAGE>   10

Dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment may be
entered on the award. The costs and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall
be shared equally between Parent and HGHC.

        The chief financial officer of HGHC, on the one hand, and the chief
financial officer of the Parent, on the other hand, and their respective
designated agents, during the Dispute Period, shall have all rights of access to
corporate records of, with respect to HGHC, the Surviving Corporation and with
respect to Buyers, HGHC to the extent related to this Agreement or Joliet, if
HGHC provides Parent with a Dispute Notice during the Dispute Period, until such
time as the Dispute raised therein is resolved by the Arbitrating Accountant.

        Section 1.07 Deposit. On the third (3rd) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement, the Buyers shall deposit THIRTEEN MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($13,950,000) (the "Deposit"), with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to an escrow agreement to be substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Deposit Escrow Agreement"). If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, then the Deposit shall be paid as set forth in
Section 10.02. Upon fulfillment of the Buyers' obligations under Sections
5.04(a) and (b) and delivery of copies of the same to the Sellers pursuant to
Section 5.04(d), the Deposit shall be released to Parent promptly pursuant to
the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

        Section 1.08 Bonus Escrow. At the Closing and in accordance with Section
1.05(i), the Buyers will deposit the Bonus Escrow to fund the Retention Bonus
Plan from the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be held by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
(the "Bonus Escrow Agreement"). The Bonus Escrow shall be used to pay the
employee bonuses under the Retention Bonus Plan pursuant to Section 6.02.

        Section 1.09 Indemnification Escrow. At the Closing and in accordance
with Section 1.05(ii), the Buyers will deposit the Indemnification Escrow from
the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to an escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Indemnification Escrow Agreement", together with the Deposit Escrow Agreement,
and the Bonus Escrow Agreement, the "Escrow Agreements"). The funds escrowed
pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement shall be used to satisfy
indemnification claims made pursuant to Section 12.01 and Article XI until such
time as the Indemnification Escrow is released in accordance with Section 13.01
and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

        Section 1.10  Conversion of Shares.

        (a) At the Effective Time: (i) each share of common stock of JAC,
outstanding at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be converted into and exchanged
for one newly issued share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and
(ii) the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Joliet
outstanding at the Effective Time (the "Shares"), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be converted and
exchanged into the right to receive the


                                       5
<PAGE>   11

Merger Consideration subject to amounts to be deposited into escrow pursuant to
the Escrow Agreements.

        (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, at the Effective Time, all Shares shall cease to be outstanding
and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and HGHC shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except for the
right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration set forth in
Section 1.05 upon the surrender of certificates representing the Shares (the
"Certificates") in accordance with the provisions of this Article I.

        (c) Each Share of Joliet held as treasury stock at the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        Section 1.11 Exchange of Certificates Representing Shares. Upon
surrender of the Certificates duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by
validly executed stock powers, HGHC shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered, each Certificate that,
at the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration.

        Section 1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of the
Buyers and each of the Sellers shall take all such action as reasonably may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement which shall include but not be limited to the Sellers providing
reasonable assistance to the Buyers in the process of obtaining all necessary
Gaming Authority approvals and consents; provided that such actions do not
unreasonably increase the liability of such party. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Joliet (subject to any and all matters disclosed herein), the
officers and directors of Joliet are fully authorized in the name of Joliet or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long
as such action is consistent with this Agreement.

        Section 1.13  Certain Matters Relating to the Surviving Corporation.

        (a) Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The
Certificate of Incorporation of Joliet in effect immediately prior to the

        Section 1.14 Allocation of Merger Consideration. Parent and HGHC agree
to treat the Merger as a sale of assets of HGHC for income tax purposes and to
take all actions reasonably necessary to effect such result. The Merger

their respective net book values as reflected in HGHC's consolidated financial
statements. Except as otherwise required by law, Buyers and HGHC agree that: (i)
the Allocation as finally determined hereunder shall be binding on Buyers and
HGHC for all federal, state and local Tax purposes, (ii) Buyers and HGHC shall

(collectively, the "Budgets"). The Budgets were prepared in good faith and in
the ordinary course based on assumptions considered reasonable at the time the
Budgets were prepared; provided, however, that Buyers acknowledge that the

accountability, and (c) Joliet is in compliance in all material respects with
the minimum internal control standards of the IGB in effect as of the date

        Section 2.08 Outstanding Debt and Related Matters. Schedule 2.08 sets
forth all outstanding Debt of Joliet. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.08,
there exists no default under the provisions of any instrument evidencing any
outstanding Debt or of any agreement relating thereto. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.08, Joliet has not guaranteed any obligation of any Person, nor has
any other Person guaranteed any obligation of Joliet, including obligations with
respect to the outstanding Debt. Following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any of the outstanding Debt of the Sellers
included on Schedule 2.08.

        Section 2.09 Taxes. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.09:

        (a) HGHC has qualified as an S corporation within the meaning of Section
1361 of the Code for each taxable year of its existence. Joliet qualifies as,
and HGHC has properly made an election to treat Joliet as, a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code,
and such election has been effective for the entire time that HGHC has owned
shares of Joliet. Joliet has qualified, and has taken such actions and filed
such elections or returns to elect, to be a qualified subchapter S subsidiary,
in each jurisdiction in which Joliet conducts its business or would otherwise be
taxable on its income for the entire time that HGHC has owned any shares of
Joliet. Neither HGHC nor Joliet has taken, or caused or permitted to be taken,
any action that would have caused a termination of the qualified subchapter S
subsidiary election with respect to Joliet for any period. Joliet will not be
liable for or subject to any Tax under Section 1374 of the Code.

        (b) Each of Joliet and, to the extent a failure to do so could result in
a lien for Taxes on the assets of Joliet, HGHC, has properly and timely filed
all income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns (considered
individually or in the aggregate), and has timely paid all Taxes shown as due
thereon. All such income Tax Returns were true, correct and complete in all
respects and all other Tax Returns were true, correct in all material respects
and were prepared in accordance with applicable laws. Each of Joliet and, to the
extent that a failure to do so would result in a lien for Taxes on the assets of
Joliet, HGHC, has or will have filed prior to or on the Closing Date all income
Tax Returns (including estimated Tax Returns and reports) and all other material
Tax Returns (considered individually or in the aggregate) required to be filed
by it or on its behalf on or before the Closing Date in each jurisdiction in
which such Tax Return is due. As


                                       10
<PAGE>   16

of the time of filing, all such income Tax Returns were or will be true, correct
and complete in all respects and all other Tax Returns were true, correct in all
material respects.

        (c) Neither HGHC nor Joliet has requested an extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return described in the preceding paragraph. Neither HGHC
nor Joliet has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any such Tax Return. There is no federal, state, local or foreign
claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Sellers, threatened or asserted against or with respect to
Joliet or, to the extent that such action could result in a lien upon the assets
of Joliet, HGHC, in respect of any Tax. All Taxes not yet due and payable have
been fully accrued on the books of Joliet and adequate reserves have been
established therefor. There are no unpaid assessments for additional Taxes for
any period nor is there any basis therefor. There are no Liens for Taxes upon
the assets of Joliet except Liens for current Taxes not yet due. The federal
income Tax Returns of HGHC have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS"), or have been closed by the applicable statute of limitations, for
all periods through December 31, 1994; the state income Tax Returns and other
material Tax Returns of HGHC and Joliet have been examined by the relevant state
agencies or such returns have been closed by the applicable statute of
limitations for all periods through December 31, 1994; and neither HGHC nor
Joliet has entered into any closing agreement or other agreement affecting Taxes
of Joliet for any taxable year ending after the Closing Date.

        (d) Joliet is not currently under any contractual obligation (whether
oral or written) to indemnify any other person with respect to Taxes nor is
Joliet a party to any agreement (whether oral or written) providing for payments
with respect to Taxes.

        (e) Neither Joliet nor HGHC has ever been a member of an affiliated
group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return or any consolidated, combined or unitary group for
state, local or foreign Tax purposes. Neither HGHC nor Joliet has any liability
for Taxes of any person (other than for Joliet) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law. Joliet
has not been a party to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement that
could be treated as a partnership for federal income Tax purposes

        (f) None of the assets of Joliet are required to be treated as being
owned by another person pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended and in effect immediately before the
enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or is "tax-exempt use property" within
the meaning of Section 168(h)(1) of the Code. No portion of the cost of any
asset of Joliet has been financed directly or indirectly from the proceeds of
any tax-exempt state or local government obligation described in Code Section
103(a).

        (g) HGHC is not a foreign person within the meaning of Code Section
1445. The assets to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger are
not part of a permanent establishment or a trade or business in any foreign
country.

Permit or other commitment to which it is a party or to which its properties,

Permit or other commitment to which it is a party or to which its properties,
assets or business is subject or bound; or (ii) any Law;

        (c) There are no actions, suits, claims, investigations, notices of
violation, or legal, arbitration or administrative proceedings in progress,
pending or to the knowledge of Sellers threatened by or against HGHC (except for
such that do not relate to Joliet or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) or Joliet (or any of their respective properties, assets or
businesses) whether at law or in equity, whether civil or criminal in nature, or
whether before or by a federal, state, local or other governmental department,
commission, board, bureau, agency, or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or
any Person, and no event has occurred which could give rise to any such action,
suit, claim, investigation, notice of violation, or legal arbitration or
administrative proceeding;

respect to consummate the transactions described in this Agreement or (ii)
Joliet; and

        (f) No action, suit, or proceeding has been instituted or, to the
knowledge of the Sellers, threatened to restrain, prohibit, or otherwise
challenge the legality or validity of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

        (a) Schedule 2.11(a) sets forth an accurate, complete and correct list
of all real property owned by Joliet (the "Owned Real Property"), and all real

encroachment endorsements for any material encroachments.

        (k) A certificate of occupancy exists for each building located on the
Owned Real Property, a true, correct and complete copy of which has been
delivered to the Buyers, and such certificate has not been amended and HGHC, at
its sole expense, has delivered or, prior to Closing, will deliver to the Buyer
updated as built ALTA surveys of each parcel of land comprising the Owned Real
Property as presently exists (any prior surveys shall be re-certified within
three (3) months of Closing to confirm that no new improvements have been
constructed since the date of the original survey), and, to the knowledge of
Sellers, without inquiry, all certificates of occupancy are valid and in full
force and effect.

        (l) To the knowledge of the Sellers, without inquiry, there are no
defaults by the landlords under any of the Leased Real Property and such
landlords have performed all of their obligations thereunder. Joliet and HGHC

qualification under such section on which Joliet may currently rely.

        (d) Each Joliet Program has been maintained in all material respects in

Affiliate is under any binding obligation to modify any Joliet Program, or to
establish any new Employee Program for the benefit of any employee of Joliet.
Joliet or an ERISA Affiliate thereof has reserved the right to amend, modify or
terminate each Joliet Program which is an "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA. There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether written or otherwise) by Joliet or any
ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Joliet Program that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such
plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that plan for the most
recent fiscal quarter included in Joliet's financial statements.

        (i) No ERISA Affiliate has any unpaid material liability, fine, penalty
or Tax with respect to any Employee Program for which Joliet could be liable.

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Illinois. Each of the Buyers has all requisite corporate power
and authority and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Parent is the sole shareholder of JAC. There
are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights of any kind to acquire any
shares of capital stock or equity interests of JAC, nor are there any
outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or which otherwise
confer on the holder thereof any right to acquire, any shares of capital stock
or equity interests of JAC, and JAC has not entered into and is not a party to
any contract, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or claim of any
kind to issue any securities. Each of the Buyers is duly qualified as a foreign
entity and is in good standing to do business in every jurisdiction in which
such qualification is necessary because of the nature of the properties or
assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted
by it, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
would not have a material adverse effect on the assets, properties, results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition of each of the Buyers.

        Section 3.02 Authority; Power; and No Violation. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and all documents to be executed in connection with
this Agreement by the Buyers have been authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of each of the Buyers. Each of the Buyers has the requisite
corporate power and corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all documents to be executed in connection with this Agreement, and to take
any and all other actions required to be taken, directly or indirectly, by it
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and all documents to be executed in
connection with this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Buyer enforceable against each Buyer in accordance
with its terms. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.02, the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the fulfillment and compliance with the terms and conditions
hereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not (a) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of the
organizational documents of either of the Buyers; (b) conflict with or result in
any material violation or material breach of or constitute a material default
(or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default) under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or result in a loss of any material benefit
under, or require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any contract to which the Buyers are subject; (c) violate in any
material respect any Law applicable to the Buyers or any of their respective
properties, assets, or outstanding shares of capital stock, or other securities;
or (d) constitute an event which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
action by a third party, could result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the assets or properties of any of the Buyers or cause the maturity of any
liability, obligation, or debt of any of the Buyers to be accelerated or
increased.

        Section 3.03 Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement by the Buyers and the consummation by the Buyers
of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not require any notice to, or
consent, authorization or approval from any court or governmental authority or
any other third party, except for (i) the filing of the pre-merger notification
report under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois,

beverages and food and the preparation of food, (v) those notices, consents,
authorizations and approvals set forth on Schedule 3.03, and (vi) such
immaterial filings and consents as may be required under any environmental,
health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any notification, disclosure or
required approval triggered by the Merger or the transactions described in this
Agreement. Any and all notices, consents, authorizations and approvals
referenced on Schedule 3.03 and required to be obtained by the Buyers prior to
the Closing, have been or, prior to the Closing, will have been made or
obtained.

        Section 3.04 Brokers' or Finders' Fees. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.04, no agent, broker, investment banker or other person or firm acting on
behalf of the Buyers and/or their directors, executive officers or other
representatives, or under their authority, is or will be entitled to any
broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee, directly or
indirectly, from Buyers in connection with the negotiations leading to this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

the Buyers, there are no facts relating to the Buyers, shareholders holding five
percent (5%) or more of Parent, or officers, directors or employees required to
obtain Level I occupational gaming licenses ("Level One Employees") that would
prevent the Buyers, shareholders holding five percent (5%) or more of Parent, or
officers, directors or Level One Employees of the Buyers from obtaining from the
applicable Gaming Authorities gaming licenses or the approvals necessary for the
Buyers to consummate the Merger.

        Section 3.06 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.06, no

                       PRECLOSING COVENANTS OF THE SELLERS

        HGHC covenants and agrees that between the date of this Agreement and

accordance with the terms hereof, HGHC shall comply, and HGHC shall cause Joliet
to comply, with the following provisions:

        Section 4.01 Exclusivity. Neither HGHC or Joliet nor any of their
respective officers, directors, stockholders, representatives or other agents,
directly or indirectly shall (for so long as Buyers shall not have breached
their obligations under this Agreement): (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
submission of any inquiry, proposal or offer from any potential investor or
acquirer relating to any transaction involving any debt or equity securities of
Joliet (currently outstanding or to be issued) or any sale or transfer of any of
the assets of Joliet other than in the ordinary course of business; (b) enter
into, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations


                                       26
<PAGE>   32

(except with the Buyers) regarding, or furnish any information to or cooperate
with any Person (other than the Buyers) with respect to, any transaction
involving any debt or equity securities of Joliet (currently outstanding or to
be issued) or any sale or transfer of any assets of Joliet, other than in the
ordinary course of business; or (c) enter into any agreement (except with the
Buyers) relating in any manner to any transaction involving any debt or equity
securities of Joliet (currently outstanding or to be issued) or any sale or
transfer of any assets of Joliet, other than in the ordinary course of business;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
including this Section 4.01, a sale of HGHC or all or substantially all of the
assets of HGHC or its subsidiaries in which either HGHC retains, or such
purchaser assumes, all of the obligations of HGHC under this Agreement (an "HGHC
Sale") is not prohibited; provided that, in the case of an assumption of this
Agreement by the purchaser, the credit rating for the subordinated debt of such
purchaser issued by S&P's or Moody's is not less than B+ or B2, respectively. If
any Seller receives, or any officer, director, stockholder, representative or
agent of Seller receives and notifies any Seller, directly or indirectly, of an
offer or proposal to enter into any transaction involving any debt or equity
securities of Joliet (currently outstanding or to be issued) or any sale or
transfer of any assets of Joliet, other than in the ordinary course of business,
HGHC shall notify Buyers by the close of business on the third following
Business Day. HGHC or Joliet, as the case may be, shall, and each shall cause
its officers, directors, stockholders, agents and representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
matters referred to in this Section 4.01. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, including this Section 4.01, Joliet shall be able to (1) sell or
transfer twenty (20) buildable acres of real estate described on Schedule
2.11(i); in Joliet, Illinois to either the City of Joliet and/or the Joliet Park
District, without having any effect on the Merger Consideration; and (2) sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any asset of Joliet as permitted by Section
4.05.

        Section 4.02 Supplements and Updates to Representations and Warranties.
HGHC shall promptly deliver to the Buyers written notice of any material
supplemental information updating the information set forth in the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II of this Agreement;
provided that no supplemental information added to or deleted from the
representations and warranties of the Sellers and the updated disclosure
schedules after the date hereof shall impair the Buyers' rights to assert or
recover damages for a breach of the Sellers' representations and warranties made
on the date hereof, and any damages accruing to the Buyers shall be paid as
provided in Article XII. Any supplemental information delivered pursuant to this
Section 4.02 shall not be considered in determining whether the condition set
forth in Section 8.02 with respect to representations and warranties has been
met. Prior to the Effective Time, the Sellers shall advise the Buyers of any
facts which would constitute a breach of a representation or warranty as of the
date made or a default in a covenant contained herein.

        Section 4.03 Maintenance of Status. Joliet will be maintained at all
times as an entity validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Illinois.

        Section 4.04 Operation of Business. Joliet shall operate its business

efforts (subject to the Gaming Board Consent) to (a) keep available the services
of its present officers and employees, (b) continue and


                                       27

business dealings with it, and (c) maintain in full force and effect all
Permits. Joliet, without the prior written consent of the Buyers, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall not: (i) grant, confer or
award any option, warrant, conversion right or other right not existing on the
date hereof to acquire any shares of its capital stock; (ii) increase any
compensation or enter into or amend any employment agreement with any of its
present or future officers, directors or employees, except for normal increases
in compensation or bonuses paid consistent with past practices in the ordinary
course of business; (iii) grant any severance or termination package to any
Joliet Employee or Joliet consultant; (iv) adopt any new Employee Program or
amend any existing Joliet Program in any material respect outside the ordinary
course of business, except as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement; (v)
enter into any agreement or transaction, or agree to enter into any agreement or
transaction, outside the ordinary course of business, including without
limitation any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, joint venture,
complete liquidation or dissolution, reorganization, recapitalization, or
restructuring or a purchase, sale, lease or other disposition of, a material
portion of its assets or capital stock, other than its use of its Current Assets
for any purpose whatsoever (other than a purpose which, directly or indirectly,
materially interferes with or is materially detrimental to the operation of the
business of Joliet); (vi) incur any Debt or guarantee any Debt or issue or sell
any debt or equity securities or warrants or rights to acquire any debt

records, or change in any material respect the accounting practices therein

and which encumber only the property for which the capital expenditure is made;
(xi) fail in any material respect to comply or continue to comply with all
applicable Laws; (xii) amend or modify in any manner its Certificate of
Incorporation, By-Laws or other organizational documents, except as required by
the Gaming Board Consent; (xiii) change in any manner the process by which any
reserves are determined except as required or necessary to comply with GAAP or

Schedule 2.13 hereto; or (xv) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
other arrangement extending beyond one year or involving consideration in excess
of $25,000 in the aggregate, provided, that, capital expenditures listed on
Schedule 4.09 are not subject to this subclause (xv), unless such contract,
agreement, commitment or other arrangement may be terminated by the Buyers upon
the Closing without the Buyers being subject to any obligation, expense or other
liability as a result of such termination. The Sellers agree that on the Closing
Date there shall be an amount of cash in the Joliet "cage vault" equal to or

lines of record, easements, rights-of-way and encroachments affecting the Owned
Real Property, and other matters apparent thereon, the relation of the Owned
Real Property to all adjacent public thoroughfares and all utilities as they
service the Owned Real Property from their respective main lines. The surveyor
must certify that the real estate depicted on the Survey does not lie in an
"area of special flood hazard" for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program. In any event, the Survey shall be sufficient to cause the Title Company
to delete the standard survey exceptions from the Title Policy and enable the
Title Company to issue a 3.1 Zoning Endorsement for the Owned Real Property
described in the Title Policy.

        Section 4.15 Confidentiality. In addition to Section 5.03, each party
hereby agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its subsidiaries) to use
reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in accordance with its customary
procedures for handling confidential information of this nature, any non-public
information supplied to it pursuant to this Agreement; provided that nothing
herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information (i) to the extent
required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (ii) to counsel for
any of the parties hereto, (iii) to potential lenders, auditors or accountants,
(iv) in connection with any litigation to which any one or more of the parties
hereto is a party relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
(v) to an Affiliate of the parties hereto. HGHC hereto agrees (on behalf of
itself and each of its subsidiaries) to use reasonable precautions to keep
confidential, in accordance with its customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature, all confidential information related to
the assets acquired by Buyers, including, without limitation, any data bases and
any customer information, of Joliet and to Joliet's business and operations;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such
information to the extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial
process. The obligation to maintain confidentiality in accordance with the
preceding sentence will continue in full force and effect from and after the
Closing Date for a period of two (2) years.

<PAGE>   37

        Section 6.01 Employee Obligations. All severance payments of any kind to
be paid to employees of Joliet as a result of the termination of such employees

employment with the Surviving Corporation solely as a result of death or
disability or, (c) shall have had his or her employment with the Surviving
Corporation terminated by the Surviving Corporation for any reason other than

the Bonus Escrow Agreement.

        Section 6.03 Actions Relating to Employee Benefit Plans. The Buyers will

with credit for all service with Joliet for purposes of eligibility and vesting
to the extent possible under each employee pension benefit plan (as defined in

under HGHC's group health plans.

required under the Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corp. 401(k) Plan ("HGHC's 401(k)
Plan") to (i) make all contributions required of it for each participating
Joliet Employee for all periods of time up to and including the Closing Date and
(ii) if permitted by the terms of HGHC's 401(k) Plan and by law, make
distribution of accounts available to each such Joliet Employee upon termination
of Joliet's status as a subsidiary of HGHC.

        Section 6.05 Transition Services Agreement. Buyers and Sellers shall
execute a Transition Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit D (the
"Transition Services Agreement") which shall provide, among other things, for
the licensing and use of trademarks following Closing by the Buyers, the use of
certain software by the Buyers and the use of Joliet office space by HGHC.

        Section 6.06 HGHC's Deferred Compensation Plan. HGHC agrees (i) that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in
the payment of the entire account balance under the Horseshoe Gaming Holding
Corp. Deferred Compensation Plan ("HGHC's Deferred Compensation Plan") becoming
due to each participating employee or former employee of Joliet and (ii) to pay
each such person the balance of his or her account under HGHC's Deferred
Compensation Plan as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.
HGHC shall retain, and neither Buyer nor Surviving Corporation shall assume or
be responsible for, any liability with respect to the payment of any amounts to
any employee or former employee of Joliet under HGHC's Deferred Compensation
Plan.

                                   TERMINATION

        Section 10.01 Events of Termination. This Agreement, by notice given in
the manner hereinafter provided, may be terminated and abandoned at any time
prior to the completion of the Closing; provided, however, that any right to
terminate, other than pursuant to subparagraphs

<PAGE>   45

(b), (e), (f) or (g), must be exercised within thirty (30) days after the
terminating party receives written notice of the event giving rise to such right
of termination:

        (a) By HGHC if there has been a material default or material breach by
any of the Buyers with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Buyers in this Agreement or the due and timely performance of any of the
covenants and agreements of the Buyers contained in this Agreement where such
default, breach or failure to perform has a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on the Sellers' or Buyers' ability to consummate the
transactions described in this Agreement, and such default, breach or failure to

of the Sellers in this Agreement or the due and timely performance of any of the
covenants and agreements of the Sellers contained in this Agreement where such
default, breach or failure to perform has a Material Adverse Effect or a

        (d) By the Buyers if (i) a Material Adverse Change has occurred since
the date of this Agreement; or (ii) a Material Adverse Change has occurred since
the date of the Financial Statement for the year ended December 31, 2000 (but

        (e) By mutual agreement of the Buyers and the Sellers; or

        (f) By either the Sellers or the Buyers, (i) if the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to July 31, 2001; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(f)(i) will not be available to
any party whose failure to timely fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date or (ii) if a FM Event has occurred and the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to the expiration of the FM Extension Period; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

                                       40
<PAGE>   46

        (g) By either the Sellers or Buyers if a court of competent jurisdiction
or a governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action not subject to
appeal, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions described in this Agreement; or

        (h) By the Buyers if HGHC or any of its Affiliates shall agree to an
HGHC Sale which does not meet the conditions of Section 4.01.

        Section 10.02 Remedies for Breach; Effect of Termination.

        (a) If a breach of Section 4.01 occurs and the Buyers do not elect to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(h), if applicable, and the
Sellers fail to close the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth herein,
then the Buyers' remedies shall be limited to (i) seeking specific performance
of the transactions described in this Agreement and after the Closing seeking
indemnification for any Indemnity Loss suffered by the Buyers pursuant to and
subject to the applicable limitations contained in Article XII, or (ii) as an
alternative to the remedy provided in clause (i) above or if the Buyers are
unsuccessful in seeking specific performance, as liquidated damages, recovering
damages in an amount equal to the difference between (x) the aggregate value (if
greater than the Merger Consideration) received by HGHC, Joliet and the
Stockholders and their respective Affiliates in connection with an acquisition
of Joliet that is consummated at any time within twenty four (24) months of such
breach, and (y) the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that such
liquidated damages shall in no event be less than $13,950,000. Sellers
acknowledge that Buyers may not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of
such breach, and, if Buyers are seeking specific performance or to recover the
preceding amount as liquidated damages, Sellers will not assert that monetary
damages are an adequate remedy. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and
agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages,
with respect to the foregoing, the right to payment of the amount set forth
above as liquidated damages constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages
that will be suffered by reason of any such termination and shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the
foregoing.

        (b) Except for a breach of Section 4.01, if the circumstances described
in Section 10.01(c) shall have occurred, then the Buyers' remedies shall be
either to (i) terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.01(c) and the Sellers shall reimburse the Buyers for their actual
damages (i.e., costs and expenses, including without limitation, legal fees and
financing costs) or (ii) close the transactions described in this Agreement and
after the Closing seek indemnification for any Indemnity Losses suffered by the
Buyers pursuant to and subject to the applicable limitations contained in
Article XII.

        (c) If the circumstances described in Section 10.01(a) shall have
occurred which involves a breach by Buyers of Section 5.05, then the Sellers'
rights and remedies shall be limited to terminating this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of Section 10.01(a) and receiving from the Buyers as
liquidated damages an amount equal to $13,950,000. The parties hereto expressly
acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining
actual damages, with respect to the foregoing, the right to payment of the
amount set forth above


                                       41
<PAGE>   47

as liquidated damages constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will
be suffered by reason of any such termination and shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.

        (d) If the circumstance described in Section 10.01(a) shall have
occurred for reasons other than a breach of Section 5.05, then the Sellers'
remedies shall be limited to terminating this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.01(a) and pursuing against the Buyers such remedies as
are available at Law or in equity, provided that in no event shall the Sellers
be entitled to recover, and in no event shall the Buyers be obligated to pay to
the Sellers, any amount in excess of, in the aggregate, Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000).

        (e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section
10.01, then all obligations of the parties shall terminate without any liability
of a party to any other party except as otherwise set forth in this Section
10.02 and in no event shall any party be entitled to seek or obtain any other
damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or
punitive damages; provided, however, that the obligations of the parties set
forth in Sections 4.15, 5.03, 13.04 and 13.06 of this Agreement and the Sellers'
indemnification obligations pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) of Section 12.01
shall indefinitely survive the termination of this Agreement.

        (f) If this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers pursuant to Section
10.01(b) (provided that in such case Buyers do not also have the right to
terminate this Agreement, in which case the second sentence of this Section
10.02(f) shall govern), then the Deposit shall be paid to the Sellers. If this
Agreement is terminated for any reason other than termination by the Sellers
pursuant to Sections 10.01(b), (or if the Buyers also have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01) then the Deposit shall be
paid to Parent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                   TAX MATTERS

        Section 11.01 Transfer Taxes. The Sellers shall prepare and attend to
the filing of any and all returns, applications or other documents regarding any
transfer, transfer gains or similar Taxes which become payable in connection
with, or by virtue of, the Merger and the other transactions described in this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and the Buyers shall reasonably
cooperate with the Sellers with respect to the preparation and filing of such
returns, applications or other documents. The Sellers shall pay (and shall
indemnify and hold the Buyers harmless against) all Transfer Taxes payable with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions described herein.

        Section 11.02 Tax Matters.

        (a) HGHC shall, or shall cause Joliet to, prepare and timely file all
Tax Returns of or including the income, assets or operations of Joliet that are
required to be filed (with extensions) on or before the Closing Date and shall
timely pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. All
such Tax Returns and information statements will be prepared and


                                       42
<PAGE>   48

filed by HGHC or Joliet in a manner consistent with the prior practice of HGHC
or Joliet, as applicable. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of or including the income, assets or operations of
the Surviving Corporation (other than Tax Returns that are the responsibility of
HGHC as described in the preceding sentence or Tax Returns of HGHC covering
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date on
which Joliet properly is treated as a disregarded entity) that are required to
be filed (with extensions) after the Closing Date and shall timely pay, or cause
to be paid, all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns.

        (b) HGHC shall be liable and indemnify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for all Taxes of Sellers (including any Taxes of the Sellers imposed
upon the deemed sale of assets contemplated pursuant to this Agreement) to the
extent such Taxes are not adequately provided for as current Taxes on the
Closing Statement for (i) taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and (ii) for any taxable period not ending on or before the Closing Date, for
the portion of any Taxes attributable to the portion of such period ending on
the Closing Date. For the purpose of Taxes determined by reference to income,
capital gains, gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits, windfall
profits or similar items or resulting from a transfer of assets, HGHC, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation agree that the taxable period of Joliet shall be
terminated or deemed terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date
and items of income, gain, loss, expense, deduction or credit shall be
apportioned between HGHC, Parent and the Surviving Corporation based upon a
closing of the books of Joliet for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
prior Tax Returns of Joliet and with the methods employed on the Closing
Statement. In applying the foregoing sentences (A) HGHC's liability for Illinois
gaming tax shall be determined by assuming an effective tax rate for the current
fiscal year equal to the blended annual Illinois gaming tax rate derived from
adding the actual casino revenues for the period of time from the beginning of
the current taxable year to the month end closest to the Closing Date and the
estimated casino revenues for the remainder of the year, and (B) liability for
any penalties, interest, or additional amounts relating to a failure to timely
comply with any information reporting requirements of the Code or any analogous
requirements under foreign, state or local law shall be allocated based on the
date such failure occurred. Any other Taxes imposed upon the assets, property or
operations of Joliet and allocable to a period that begins before, but ends
after, the Closing Date, shall be apportioned between HGHC and Parent, or the
Surviving Corporation, by multiplying such Tax by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period prior to, and including, the
Closing Date, or the number of days subsequent to the Closing Date (as
applicable) and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
relevant taxable period. The amount of any indemnity payment in respect of Taxes
(and related expenses described in Section 11.04(c)) shall be reduced to take
account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Buyers arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Taxes (or related expenses). In computing the
amount of any such Tax benefit, the Buyers shall be deemed to recognize all
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any
item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Taxes (or related expenses). Any
indemnification payment hereunder shall be made without regard to any net Tax
benefit until after the Buyers has realized such benefit. For purposes of this
Agreement, Buyers shall be deemed to have "realized" a net Tax benefit to the
extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by Buyers is
increased above the amount of Taxes Buyers would be required to pay but for the

                                       43
<PAGE>   49
receipt of the indemnity payment or the incurrence of payment of such Taxes (or
expenses), as the case may be. The amount of any reduction hereunder shall be
adjusted to reflect any final determination with respect to the Buyer's
liability for Taxes and payments among the parties to reflect such adjustment
shall be made if necessary. HGHC and Buyers agree to treat all payments made
pursuant to this Article XI as adjustments of the Merger Consideration.

        (c) For each taxable year of HGHC for which the operations, income or
assets of Joliet are required to be included for all or any part of such taxable
year on a Tax Return or other information statement of HGHC which is due (with
all extensions) to be filed after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare, in a manner consistent with
the prior practice of Joliet, and deliver to HGHC no later than February 15th,
all relevant Tax schedules, forms and information relating to Joliet, complete
in all material respects, to permit the inclusion of Joliet's income and
operations in such Tax Returns or other information statements of HGHC for each
such taxable year.

        Section 11.03 Cooperation, Access to Records.

        (a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will provide HGHC (and its
attorneys, accountants and agents) with the right, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, to have access to, and to copy and use, any records or
information and personnel which may be relevant for the preparation of any Tax
Returns, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, the filing of
any claim for a refund of Tax or for the allowance of any Tax credit, or any
judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes. Any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 11.03(a) shall be held in strict
confidence and shall be used solely in connection with the reason for which it
was requested.

        (b) HGHC shall cause any tax sharing agreement or similar arrangement
with respect to Taxes involving Joliet to be terminated effective as of the
Closing Date. To the extent any such agreement or arrangement obligates Joliet
to make any payments with respect to Taxes after the Closing Date, none of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall have any obligation under any such
agreement or arrangement for any past, present or future period.

        Section 11.04 Determination of Tax Allocation; Tax Contests.

        (a) In the case of any Tax Return filed by the Buyers or the Surviving
Corporation for any taxable period for which HGHC could be held liable for Taxes
pursuant to Section 11.02(b), the Buyers shall provide HGHC with copies of the
completed Tax Return for such taxable period, together with such related work
papers and other documents as HGHC shall reasonably request, no later than
thirty (30) days before the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, along
with a statement allocating the aggregate Tax liability shown on such Tax Return
between the Buyers and HGHC pursuant to the principles of Section 11.02(b). HGHC
shall have no right to review any such Tax Returns unless and until the
aggregate Taxes shown on all such Tax Returns for taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on the Closing Date exceeds the relevant accrual for such Taxes
on the Closing Statement; following such time, HGHC may reasonably request to
review previously filed Tax Returns in the event a deficiency is proposed or
assessed with respect to such Tax Returns to determine HGHC's liability for
Taxes pursuant to Section


                                       44
<PAGE>   50

11.02(b). HGHC and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review
the Tax Returns and statements received from the Buyers pursuant to the terms of
this Section 11.04(a). HGHC and the Buyers agree to consult each other and
resolve in good faith any issues arising under the terms of this Section
11.04(a) as a result of the review of any such Tax Returns or statement received
from the Buyers. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within sixty
(60) business days after the receipt of any such Tax Returns or statement, the
parties shall refer the dispute to a nationally-recognized independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the parties for resolution. The
accounting firm's determination shall be final and binding upon the parties, and
all fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the accounting firm shall be
shared equally by HGHC and the Buyers. If such disputes have not been resolved
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, such Tax Return, to the
extent issues thereon remain unresolved, shall be filed in accordance with the
positions taken by the Buyers, and HGHC will pay to Buyers at least three (3)
days prior to the due date for such Tax Return the amount of Taxes shown as
allocable to HGHC on the statement; provided that the fact that the Tax Return
was filed in accordance with the Buyer's position shall not be taken into
account for purposes of any dispute resolution. If a determination is made by
the accounting firm after a Tax Return is filed that the Buyer's position was
incorrect, the Buyers shall promptly file an amended Tax Return (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) reflecting the final decision of the accounting
firm, and the Buyers shall pay the amount of any refund of Tax (or the portion
thereof attributable to HGHC) shown on such amended Tax Return to HGHC no later
than three (3) days after the date of the filing of such amended Tax Return.

        (b) Any refund of Taxes (other than a refund that is reflected on the
Closing Statement) with respect to Joliet or the Surviving Corporation that is
received with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date shall be for the account of HGHC. To the extent that the
Buyers, the Surviving Corporation, or any affiliate thereof receives any refund
of such Taxes after the Closing Date with respect to such taxable period (or
portion thereof), the amount of such refund of Taxes allocable to such taxable
period (or portion thereof) shall be promptly paid to HGHC.

        (c) If a claim is made or threatened by any Taxing Authority that, if
successful, may result in an indemnity payment under Section 11.02(b) hereof (a
"Tax Claim"), the Buyers shall notify HGHC stating the nature and basis of such
claim, and the amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice
shall not relieve HGHC from any liability that it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that HGHC is materially
prejudiced in the defense of such claim thereby. HGHC will have the right, at
its option, upon timely notice to the Buyers, to assume at its own expense
control of any audit or other defense of any Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim
relating solely to Taxes of Joliet or the Surviving Corporation for taxable
periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date) with its own
counsel. If HGHC elects not to control any audit or other defense of a Tax
Claim, the Buyers shall have the authority to settle without HGHC's consent such
Tax Claim provided that the amount of such settlement does not exceed the amount
initially proposed in respect of such Tax Claim. The Buyer's will not settle any
such Tax Claim for an amount greater than initially proposed without HGHC's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as HGHC has
provided the Buyers with timely notice of its intent to control any audit or
other defense of a Tax Claim and HGHC is actively contesting such claim in good
faith, the Buyers


                                       45
<PAGE>   51

shall not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax Claim. HGHC's right to control a
Tax Claim will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in dispute would
be paid by HGHC or for which HGHC would be liable pursuant to Section 11.02(b)
hereof, which determination shall be made by HGHC in its sole discretion. Costs
of contesting such issues are to be borne solely by HGHC. To the extent
reasonable, the Buyers shall cooperate with HGHC in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention for seven years and, upon HGHC's
request, providing of retained records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any
material provided hereunder. HGHC shall promptly reimburse the Buyers for the
reasonable costs of complying with the foregoing sentence and shall not make any
requests pursuant to the foregoing sentence that result in an unreasonable
disruption of the Buyers' businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) HGHC
shall not have the right to control any issue involved in a Tax Claim unless
HGHC first acknowledges in writing its obligation to fully indemnify the Buyers
for the Taxes asserted in connection with such issue, (ii) no settlement or
disposition of any Tax Claim shall be made without the Buyers' prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (iii) the Buyers
shall control all proceedings involving any claims for Taxes assessed in respect
of a taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") unless HGHC's share of the proposed deficiency in respect of
a Tax Claim exceeds Buyer's share of the proposed deficiency, in which case
Buyers and HGHC shall jointly control such proceedings. The Buyers will not be
obligated to settle or resolve and HGHC will not settle or resolve any issue
related to Taxes, which, if so settled or resolved, could or would have an
adverse effect on the Buyers for periods after the Closing Date, unless HGHC
agrees in writing with the Buyers, in terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyers, to indemnify the Buyers, any affiliate of the Buyers, and Joliet from
any cost, damage, loss or expense relating to such settlement or resolution. The
Buyers agree not to settle a Tax Claim in respect of a Straddle Period without
HGHC's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        (d) If there is an adjustment to any return or report of Taxes for
Joliet or the Surviving Corporation which creates a deficiency in any Taxes for
which HGHC is liable under the provisions of Section 11.02 hereof, HGHC shall
pay to Buyers the amount of such deficiency in Taxes together with HGHC's share
of any expenses under Section 11.04(c). No liability of HGHC under this Section
11.04(d) shall be payable until the occurrence of any action by any Tax
authority that is final or, if not final, is acquiesced in by HGHC during the
course of any audit or any proceeding relating to Taxes. All payments required
to be made by HGHC pursuant to this Section 11.04(d) shall be made within ten
(10) Business Days of this occurrence of the event described in the immediately
preceding sentence.

        Section 11.05 Interaction with Article XII. HGHC's obligations under
this Article XI shall not be subject to any of the limitations contained in
Article XII, including, without limitation, the Basket, the Cap and the time
limitations contained in Section 12.06. Any amounts paid to the Buyers under
this Article XI shall not be applied against the Basket or the Cap (each as
defined in Section 12.06(b)) contained in Article XII. To the extent of any
inconsistency between this Article XI and Article XII, the provisions of this
Article XI shall control.


                                       46

        Section 11.06 Protective Section 338(h)(10) Election. HGHC and Parent
agree to join in a timely manner in making elections on a protective basis under
section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and to the extent necessary to allow for an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, an election under Section 338(g)
of the Code) and any corresponding election under foreign, state or local law
with respect to Parent's acquisition of Joliet. Parent shall prepare, at its own
expense, all forms necessary for such protective elections and shall allocate
the aggregate deemed sales price (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations)
in accordance with the allocation agreed upon by the parties pursuant to Section
1.14.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        Section 12.01 Indemnification. Each of the Buyers and their respective
successors, stockholders, officers, directors, Affiliates, representatives and
agents (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by HGHC against, any and all damages (including punitive damages),
losses, obligations, demands, liabilities, claims, administrative or other
fines, encumbrances, penalties, costs, and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees which shall be advanced (including advances on a monthly basis
of reasonable attorneys' fees to be incurred by the Buyers in connection with
the McGowan Lawsuit prior to and after the Closing for which the foregoing
undertaking shall not be required) subject to an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
the indemnified party was not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(and costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in respect of any suit to enforce this
provision) (each an "Indemnity Loss") (which shall not include consequential
damages or claims for lost profits), arising from or related to (a) any breach
of any representation or warranty by the Sellers contained in Article II of this
Agreement or any breach or failure by any of the Sellers to perform or fulfill
any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Sellers contained in this Agreement
or any related agreement, instrument, document, exhibit, schedule or certificate
furnished or required to be furnished by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions described herein, to the extent such
breach has not been cured as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Buyers shall not be entitled to any recovery pursuant to Section 12.01(a) to the
extent that any Buyer had actual knowledge as of the Closing Date, of a breach
of any representation or warranty in Article II, did not disclose such breach to
the Sellers prior to the Closing Date and the liability is not a liability which
would have fallen within the definition of Current Liabilities if originally
disclosed; provided, further, that for purposes of Buyers' right to
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.01(a) for a breach of Section 2.11(g) or
Section 2.18, such representation and warranty shall be deemed to have been made
without reference to Schedule 2.18 or the Environmental Reports and without the
attachment of Schedule 2.18 to this Agreement or the Environmental Reports;
provided, finally, that the Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnitees for any liabilities resulting from a breach (except
liabilities set forth on the Closing Statement in accordance with Section 1.06
hereof) if such liabilities arose out of obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business to the extent (i) the benefit thereof accrues to the Buyers
or their Affiliates, (ii) such liabilities do not arise from a transaction with
an Affiliate of the Sellers, (iii) such liabilities were incurred in an arms
length


                                       47
<PAGE>   53

transaction and (iv) such liabilities do not exceed $50,000 in the aggregate;
(b) any fees or other costs of investment bankers or third parties representing
the Sellers, or claiming to represent the Sellers, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (a "Broker Claim"); (c) the McGowan Lawsuit
and/or any other action, suit or proceeding relating thereto or arising
therefrom, directly or indirectly, seeking rescission or to enjoin or otherwise
prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby and/or any action, suit or
proceeding initiated by any former stockholder or director of Joliet or its
predecessor entities (the "Prior Owner/Directors") relating to or arising from,
directly or indirectly, the prior merger and related transactions pursuant to
which HGHC acquired Joliet and actions, transactions, agreements or arrangements
whatsoever between or among any of Sellers and the Prior Owner/Directors, the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (any
and all matters referenced in this clause (c) shall be referred to herein as
"Merger Lawsuits"), it being specifically agreed and acknowledged that all
matters relating to or arising from the Merger Lawsuits are the responsibility
of HGHC, and not the Buyers or Joliet; (d) any event occurring prior to the
Closing and involving any employment related claims, demands or charges for or
related to breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, implied
contract, wrongful discharge, sexual or other harassment, discrimination, equal
employment opportunity laws, unfair labor practice charges, violations of 42 USC
Section 2000e et. seq. or 42 USC Section 1981, the National Labor Relations Act,
or any collective bargaining agreement or employment agreement; and (e) any and
all suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, demands, assessments,
penalties, settlements, compromises, audits and judgments arising out of any of
the foregoing.

        Section 12.02 Indemnification by the Buyers. The Buyers shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless HGHC and its successors, stockholders,
officers, directors, Affiliates, representatives, and agents (collectively, the
"HGHC Indemnitees") from and against any and all Indemnity Losses (which shall
not include consequential damages or claims for lost profits) resulting from or
relating to (a) any breach of any representation or warranty, or any breach or
failure of any of the Buyers to perform or fulfill any covenant, agreement or
obligation of the Buyers contained in this Agreement or any related agreement,
instrument, document, exhibit, schedule or certificate furnished or required to
be furnished by any of the Buyers pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the transactions described in this Agreement and (b) any and all suits,
actions, investigations, proceedings, demands, assessments, penalties,
settlements, compromises, audits and judgments arising out of any of the
foregoing, it being specifically agreed and acknowledged that all matters
relating to or arising from the Merger Lawsuits are the responsibility of HGHC,
and not the Buyers or Joliet.

        Section 12.03 Notice. If an indemnified party (the "Claimant") believes
that it has suffered or incurred any Indemnity Loss, it shall so notify the
indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing describing
such loss or expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of
computation of such loss or expense, all with reasonable particularity (the
"Indemnification Notice"). If any action at law, suit in equity, or
administrative action is instituted by or against a third party with respect to
which the Claimant intends to claim any liability or expense as an Indemnity
Loss under this Article XII, it shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such action or suit describing such loss or expenses, the amount
thereof, if known, and the method of computation of such loss or expense, all
with reasonable particularity (the "Litigation Notice") in lieu of an
Indemnification Notice. After delivering the


                                       48
<PAGE>   54

Indemnification Notice or the Litigation Notice, as the case may be, the
Claimant shall provide to the Indemnifying Party such information as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, including all documents filed
with any court or governmental agency, to assist the Indemnifying Party in
determining whether the Claimant shall be indemnified against such Indemnity
Loss.

        Section 12.04 Arbitration.

        (a) Subject to the limitations on indemnification contained in this
Article XII if the Indemnifying Party does not agree that the Claimant is
entitled to full reimbursement for the amount specified in the Indemnification
Notice or the Litigation Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Claimant (the "Disagreement Notice") within twenty (20) days of its receipt of
the Indemnification Notice or Litigation Notice, as the case may be. Failure to
deliver a Disagreement Notice in a timely manner shall be considered an express
acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party of the Claimant's right to
indemnification with respect to the Indemnity Loss set forth in the
Indemnification Notice or the Litigation Notice, as the case may be in
accordance with the terms of this Article XII. At any time after delivery of the
Disagreement Notice, either the Claimant or the Indemnifying Party may notify
the other that the determination as to whether and in what amount the Claimant
is entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying Party shall be made by an
arbitration tribunal (the "Arbitration Notice"). The arbitration tribunal shall
consist of three arbitrators, one to be selected by the Claimant, one to be
selected by the Indemnifying Party, and the third arbitrator to be selected by
the other two arbitrators. The arbitrators shall each be reasonably experienced
in conducting arbitration proceedings and all arbitrators shall be selected
within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Arbitration Notice. If either
party fails to appoint an arbitrator within the specified time period, the
arbitration hearing shall be conducted by the arbitrator appointed by the party
hereto which selected an arbitrator within the required time period. An
arbitration hearing shall then be held within thirty (30) days of the selection
of the third arbitrator, or the failure of one party to select an arbitrator, in
Chicago, Illinois and the arbitration tribunal shall render its determination as
to whether and in what amount the Claimant is entitled to indemnification within
thirty (30) days of such hearing. All procedures with respect to the arbitration
proceeding provided for in this Section 12.04(a) shall be in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association, except as otherwise specifically
set forth in this Agreement.

        (b) All costs and expenses incurred in conducting the arbitration
proceeding provided for in Section 12.04(a), including attorneys' fees, shall be
borne exclusively by the losing party as determined by the arbitration tribunal;
provided, however, that the arbitration tribunal may determine that more than
one party is a losing party in which event the arbitrational tribunal shall
allocate the costs and expenses of the arbitration among such losing parties as
they determine to be just and fair.

        (c) The parties hereby irrevocably consent to be bound by the decision
of the arbitration tribunal with respect to indemnification determinations.

        Section 12.05 Defense of Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Litigation Notice to notify the Claimant
that it acknowledges its obligation to


                                       49
<PAGE>   55

indemnify and hold harmless the Claimant with respect to the Indemnity Loss set
forth in the Litigation Notice and that it elects to conduct and control any
legal or administrative action or suit with respect to an indemnifiable claim
(the "Election Notice"). If the Indemnifying Party fails to give a Disagreement
Notice or does not give the foregoing Election Notice, the Claimant shall have
the right to defend, contest, settle, or compromise such action or suit in the
exercise of its exclusive discretion. If the Indemnifying Party gives the
foregoing Election Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
undertake, conduct, and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its
sole expense, the conduct and settlement of such action or suit, and the
Claimant shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith;
provided, however, that: (a) the Indemnifying Party shall not thereby consent to
the imposition of any injunction against the Claimant, or pay or settle any
action or suit that affects the Claimant, any Seller or any Buyer, without the
written consent of the Claimant and such affected Seller or Buyer, if
applicable, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld; (b) the
Indemnifying Party shall permit the Claimant to participate in such conduct or
settlement through counsel chosen by the Claimant, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by the Claimant except as provided in clause (c);
(c) upon a final determination of such action or suit, the Claimant, to the
extent required under and in accordance with this Article XII, shall be paid for
the full amount of any Indemnity Loss incurred by the Claimant except for fees
and expenses of counsel that the Claimant incurred after the assumption of the
conduct and control of such action or suit by the Indemnifying Party in good
faith; and (d) the Claimant shall have the right to pay or settle any such
action or suit, provided that in such event the Claimant shall waive any right
to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party and no amount in respect thereof
shall be claimed as an Indemnity Loss under this Article XII.

        Section 12.06 Limitations on Indemnification.

        (a) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under Section
12.01 unless a claim has been asserted by written notice, specifying the details
of the matter giving rise to the indemnity claim to HGHC on or prior to the two
(2) year anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however that there shall be
no limitation on the time for submitting a claim for or arising out of or
related to (i) the Merger Lawsuits, or (ii) an allegation of breach of the
representations in the first two sentences of Section 2.02, clause (a) of the
fourth sentence in Section 2.02 and Section 2.03; provided, further, that the
indemnity claim made pursuant to Section 2.09 must be asserted within sixty (60)
days of the end of the applicable statute of limitations period, after giving
effect to any extensions thereof (and including any applicable statute of
limitations for a taxable year of the Surviving Corporation for which a breach
of Section 2.09(a) could result in an increased liability for Taxes of the
Surviving Corporation).

        (b) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under Section
12.01: (i) to the extent the aggregate claims for Indemnity Losses of the Buyer
Indemnitees are less then $1,000,000 (the "Basket") or exceed $13,950,000
(whether such amounts have been paid directly by HGHC or out of the
Indemnification Escrow, collectively, the "Cap"), except as otherwise provided
in Section 12.08; provided that if the aggregate of all claims for Indemnity
Losses equals or exceeds the Basket, then Buyers shall be entitled to recover
for all such Indemnity Losses subject to the limitations in this Section
12.06(b) or (ii) to the extent the subject matter of the claim is covered by
insurance (including title insurance) and such insurance is collected by


                                       50
<PAGE>   56

the Buyer Indemnitees; or (iii) to the extent that the matter in question, taken
together with all similar matters, does not exceed the amount of any reserves
with respect to such matters which are reflected in the Financial Statements; or
(iv) to the extent the matter in question was taken into account in the
computation of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I. To the extent the
subject matter of a claim is covered by a reserve reflected in the Financial
Statements, the value of such claim shall not be included in determining whether
the aggregate Indemnity Losses equal or exceed the Basket. If HGHC pays Buyer
Indemnitees for a claim and subsequently insurance in respect of such claim is
collected by the Buyer Indemnitees then Buyer Indemnitees shall remit the money
back to HGHC. In addition, if HGHC pays Buyer Indemnitees for a claim and
subsequently the Buyer Indemnitees or their shareholders realize a net Tax
benefit as a result of any expense, payment or other item giving rise to such
indemnification payment, the Buyers shall pay to HGHC the aggregate amount of
such net Tax benefit as soon as practicable following the realization of such
benefit. The guidelines for determining the amount and timing of the
realization, and the provision for subsequent adjustments, of net Tax benefits
set forth in Section 11.02(b) shall apply for purposes of this Section 12.06(b).
HGHC and the Buyers agree to treat any payments in respect of Indemnity Losses
as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

        Section 12.07 Payment of Losses. The Claimant shall be paid in cash by
the Indemnifying Party the amount to which the Claimant may become entitled by
reason of the provisions of this Article XII, within fifteen (15) days after
such amount is determined either by mutual agreement of the parties or pursuant
to the arbitration proceeding described in Section 12.04 of this Agreement or on
the date on which both such amount and Claimant's obligation to pay such amount
have been determined by a final judgment of a court or administrative body
having jurisdiction over such proceeding.

        Section 12.08 Limitations in Section 12.06(b) Inapplicable.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be
no limitation on the aggregate amount for which a Claimant may be indemnified
pursuant to this Article XII (i) in the event of fraud by the Indemnifying Party
in connection with the matter for which indemnification is sought (a "Fraud
Claim"), (ii) for any claim whatsoever relating in any way to or arising out of
the Merger Lawsuits (a "Merger Claim"), (iii) for any claim arising out of a
breach of the representations set forth in the first two sentences of Section
2.02, clause (a) of the fourth sentence in Section 2.02 or Section 2.03 or
Section 2.09, (iv) for any claim relating to any casino or enterprise directly

benefit a warranty, representation, covenant or condition is intended may in
writing waive any inaccuracies in the warranties and representations contained
in this Agreement or waive compliance with any of the covenants or conditions

this Agreement are not intended to, and shall not, benefit any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement and any agent bank or other lender and any Person
or Persons which have agreed to provide financing as their interests may appear
for the consummation of the Merger, including without limitation their
successors and assigns, and the provisions hereof are not intended to, and shall
not create any third party beneficiary right in any other Person.

        Section 13.13 Successors and Assigns; Assignment. No party to this
Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of all other parties, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement is
binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Sellers hereby consent to the
assignment by Buyers of Buyers' rights under this Agreement, including without
limitation their

<PAGE>   62

        (a) In consideration of the Buyers entering into this Agreement, HGHC
and its Affiliates undertake that for one (1) year after the Closing Date it
will not:

               (i) participate, assist or otherwise be directly or indirectly
involved or concerned, financially or otherwise, as a member, shareholder, unit
holder, director, consultant, adviser, contractor, principal, agent, manager,
beneficiary, partner, associate, trustee, financier or otherwise (other than as
a five percent (5%) or less shareholder, member, unitholder, beneficiary,
partner or associate, in each case, of a public company) in any business that
owns and/or operates one or more casinos in the State of Illinois, provided,
that this Section 13.16(a)(i) shall not apply to any Person which acquires
substantially all of the outstanding voting securities of HGHC or substantially
all of the assets of HGHC and its subsidiaries;

               (ii) purchase, conduct or otherwise engage in, directly or
indirectly, any billboard advertising within a ten (10) mile radius of the
Joliet casino and any print advertising in any newspapers or similar print media
publications based in Joliet;

               (iii) solicit, canvass, induce or encourage directly or
indirectly any employee of Joliet to leave the employment of Joliet (which shall
not prohibit general advertising in newspaper or print media other than those
which are based in Joliet);

               (iv) subject to the succeeding sentence, interfere or attempt to
interfere, directly or indirectly, with any relationship between Joliet and any
customer of Joliet who is included on the Joliet LSI Player Data Base delivered
at Closing. Subject to the succeeding sentence, the Buyers acknowledge that HGHC
and its Affiliates may engage in marketing to certain customers on the Joliet
LSI Player Data Base delivered at Closing who have also been rated or carded
play customers (including inactive players) of any of HGHC's other indirectly
owned casinos during the period from the Closing Date and going back twelve (12)
months prior to the Closing Date and such marketing activity with respect to
such customers shall not be a violation of this Section 13.16; provided, that
the Sellers have provided the Buyers with an accurate list of all customers of
Joliet meeting the criteria described in Section 2.14. In no event shall HGHC
and its Affiliates engage in direct or targeted marketing of or providing
"comps" to customers on the Joliet LSI Player Data Base provided to the Buyers
at the Closing who are not also rated or carded players (including inactive
players) of one of HGHC's other indirectly owned casinos during the period from
the Closing Date and going back twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however that HGHC's other indirectly owned casinos may engage in
direct or targeted marketing and the provision of "comps" to customers on the
Joliet LSI Player Data Base provided at Closing if such customers visit one of
such other indirectly owned casinos and meet the criteria for marketing and the
provision of "comps" of such other indirectly owned casinos.

        (b) If any of the separate and independent covenants and restraints
referred to in clause (a) of this Section 13.16 are or become invalid or
unenforceable for any reason then that invalidity or unenforceability will not
affect the validity or enforceability of any other separate and independent
covenants and restraints.


                                       57
<PAGE>   63

        (c) If any prohibition or restriction contained in clause (a) of this
Section 13.16 is judged to go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances,
but would be judged reasonable if that activity was deleted or that period or
area was reduced, then the prohibitions or restrictions apply with that activity
deleted or period or area reduced by the minimum amount necessary.

        (d) The Sellers acknowledge that:

               (i) the prohibitions and restrictions contained in clause (a) of
this Section 13.16 are reasonable and necessary; and

               (ii) the Sellers have received valuable consideration for
agreeing to the covenants in clause (a) of this Section 13.16.

        (e) The Sellers and the Buyers acknowledge and agree that it will be
difficult to compute the amount of damage or loss to the Buyers if HGHC violated
any of its agreements under this Section 13.16, that the Buyers will be without
an adequate legal remedy if HGHC violated the provisions of this Section 13.16,
and that any such violation may cause substantial irreparable injury and damage
to the Buyers not fully compensable by monetary damages. Therefore, the Sellers
and the Buyers agree that in the event of any violation by HGHC of this Section
13.16, the Buyers shall be entitled (i) to recover from HGHC monetary damages,
(ii) to obtain specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief, of
either a preliminary or permanent type, and (iii) to seek any other available
rights or remedies at law or in equity which may be exercised concurrently with
the rights granted hereunder.

                            DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT

               DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of April 12,
2001, by and among ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"),
HORSESHOE GAMING HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), and AMERICAN
NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CHICAGO, as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Agent").

                                R E C I T A L S:

   ARTICLE XV Buyer and Seller are parties to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
   dated as of April 12, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"). Capitalized terms used
   herein and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings assigned
   to those terms in the Merger Agreement.

   ARTICLE XVI Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Buyer is required on this date
   to deposit immediately available funds in the amount of THIRTEEN MILLION NINE
   HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($13,950,000) (the "Initial Deposit") with the
   Escrow Agent. The Initial Deposit, together with the interest earned thereon,
   is referred to as the "Deposit." Buyer and Seller desire that the Escrow
   Agent hold the Deposit as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agent is
   willing to enter into this Agreement and perform the services described in
   this Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, agree as
follows:

Section 16.01 Receipt of Deposit; Deposit Escrow Account. By its signature
below, the Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt from Buyer of the Initial Deposit.
The Escrow Agent shall establish an account (the "Deposit Escrow Account") for
Buyer and Seller and place the Initial Deposit therein. The Escrow Agent agrees
that the Deposit shall be held in the Deposit Escrow Account and disbursed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
this Agreement.

Section 16.02  Investment of Funds.

        (a) The Deposit shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent, as
jointly directed in writing by Buyer and Seller, in (a) bonds, treasury notes or
other evidences of indebtedness of, and those instruments unconditionally
guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by, the United States, or
(b) money market accounts, regular depository accounts, certificates of deposit
of banks or trust companies (including, without limitation, the Escrow Agent)
organized under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, each of
which has


<PAGE>   74

combined capital, surplus and retained earnings of at least One Billion Dollars;
provided, that any investment instrument shall have the ability to be liquidated
upon seventy-two (72) hours notice. In investing and reinvesting any such
monies, the Escrow Agent shall act only pursuant to a letter of direction
executed by a representative of Buyer and of Seller. In the absence of
investment direction as described above, the Escrow Agent shall invest the
deposit in the One Group Prime Money Market Fund Class A Shares.

        (b) The interest earned on the Deposit shall be paid to Buyer and Buyer
shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes thereon. The Federal Tax
Identification number of Buyer is 37-1304247.

Section 16.03  Disposition of Deposit.

        (a) If the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article X of the
Merger Agreement, the Initial Deposit, without any right of set-off, shall be
paid as set forth in Section 10.02 of the Merger Agreement. If, prior to
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Buyers to the Merger Agreement (i)
fulfill their obligations under Sections 5.04(a) and (b) of the Merger Agreement
and (ii) deliver all the documents pursuant to Section 5.04(d) of the Merger
Agreement, then the Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit to Buyer in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3. Except as provided in Section
3.2 below, the Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit only upon receipt of (i)
joint written instructions executed by Buyer and Seller, (ii) an order of the
arbitration tribunal (the "Arbitration Tribunal") pursuant to Section 12.04 of
the Merger Agreement, or (iii) a final non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction. Upon release of the Initial Deposit as provided for
herein, this Agreement shall terminate, and the Escrow Agent shall be discharged
of any further liability.

        (b) Either of Buyer or Seller may notify the Escrow Agent and the other
party hereto in writing of its claim that it is entitled to the Initial Deposit
(a "Disbursement Notice"), in the form of Exhibit A. Such claiming party, in
reasonable detail, shall cite the Section(s) of the Merger Agreement and the
facts and circumstances supporting its claim to the Initial Deposit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to state in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances supporting the claim to the Initial Deposit shall not
invalidate the Disbursement Notice to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will
send notice of the claim to the other party hereto. Unless the other party
notifies the Escrow Agent in writing of its objection within ten (10) calendar
days of the Escrow Agent's notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release the
Initial Deposit as specified in the Disbursement Notice.

        (c) Buyer and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any dispute that may arise with respect to this Agreement. If at any
time, Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, believes that a
dispute exists among them with respect to this Agreement, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to the other party and the Escrow Agent. Any dispute
which has not been settled or resolved within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by Buyer or Seller of the notice thereof, as the case may be, shall be
submitted for binding arbitration in an arbitration proceeding that, except as
may otherwise be provided therein, shall be conducted by the Arbitration
Tribunal in the same manner as the arbitration referenced in Section 12.04 of
the Merger Agreement. The Arbitration Tribunal's decision shall be binding

<PAGE>   75

and conclusive upon the parties and the Escrow Agent. As soon as a decision has
been made, the Arbitration Tribunal shall promptly deliver such decision to each
of the parties hereto, and the Initial Deposit shall be disbursed by the Escrow
Agent as directed by the Arbitration Tribunal in such notice. Each party hereto
agrees to provide notice in writing of the commencement of any such arbitration
proceeding to the Escrow Agent and the other party, as the case may be.

Section 16.04 Responsibilities of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent's acceptance of
its duties under this Agreement is subject to the following terms and
conditions, which shall govern and control with respect to its rights, duties,
liabilities and immunities:

        (a) The Escrow Agent makes no representations or warranties and has no
responsibilities as to the correctness of any statement contained herein, and
the Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as to the performance of any
obligation under any agreement or document other than this Agreement.

        (b) The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document from either
Buyer or Seller, not only as to its due execution and the validity and
effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth of any information
therein contained and what it purports to be. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, instruction, notice,
instrument or other writing delivered to it in compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of service
thereof. The Escrow Agent may act or fail to act in reliance upon any instrument
comporting with the provisions of this Agreement or signature believed by it,
without independent investigation, to be genuine and may assume that any person
purporting to give notice or advice or make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do
so.

        (c) The sole duty of the Escrow Agent, other than as herein specified,
shall be to receive the Initial Deposit and hold it and any interest earned
thereon subject to release, in accordance with the written instructions of Buyer
and Seller or as otherwise provided for herein, and the Escrow Agent shall be
under no duty to determine whether the Buyer and/or Seller are complying with
requirements of the Merger Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations shall
be inferred from this Agreement against the Escrow Agent, nor shall the Escrow
Agent be bound by the provisions of any agreement beyond the specific terms
hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein and shall neither be obligated to recognize nor have
any liability or responsibility arising under any other agreement to which the
Escrow Agent is not a party, even though reference thereto may be made herein.
The Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as to the performance of any
obligation under any agreement or document, including, without limitation, the
Merger Agreement or any agreements and documents referred to herein or therein
nor shall the Escrow Agent be under any obligation to take any legal action in
connection with this Agreement or towards its enforcement or performance or to
appear in, prosecute or defend any action or legal proceeding in connection
herewith.

<PAGE>   76

        (d) Except as set forth in Sections 4.6, 4.7 and 8, the Escrow Agent
does not have any interest in the Deposit, but is serving as escrow holder only
and has only possession thereof.

        (e) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or
for any mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from
doing in connection herewith, except as may result from its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

        (f) The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation on
account of this Agreement, it shall have the right to retain counsel and shall
have a first lien on the property deposited hereunder for any and all costs,
attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in connection with such
litigation; and shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the
property deposited hereunder, and if it shall be unable to reimburse itself from
the property deposited hereunder, the parties hereto jointly and severally agree
to pay to the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable charges, counsel and
attorneys' fees, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and any statement made in Section 4.7, if the
litigation or other proceeding in respect of which the Escrow Agent is entitled
to reimbursement arose from a claim by Buyer against Seller or by Seller against
Buyer, then the losing party to such litigation (the "Losing Party") only shall
bear the Escrow Agent's attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in
connection with such litigation or other proceeding. The Losing Party also
agrees (i) to bear the attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses of
the party prevailing in such litigation or other proceeding (the "Prevailing
Party") and (ii) to indemnify the Prevailing Party for any portion of the
Deposit to which the Prevailing Party would otherwise be entitled but for the
use by the Escrow Agent of such funds to pay the attorneys' fees, charges,
disbursements and expenses of such litigation or other proceeding.

        (g) The Buyer and Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the
Escrow Agent against and save it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities,
costs, payments and expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
(who may be selected by the Escrow Agent), incurred as a result of or in
connection with the performance of this Agreement, except as a result of the
Escrow Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, that costs
and expenses shall be advanced to the Escrow Agent until a final unappealable
determination has been made that the Escrow Agent is not entitled to
indemnification. The Escrow Agent shall have a first lien on the property
deposited hereunder for any and all amounts due under this Section; and shall be
entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited hereunder if
such amounts have not been paid within thirty (30) calendar days of a written
demand.

        (h) The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are solely ministerial in
nature, and the Escrow Agent shall not have any liability under, or duty to
inquire into, the terms and provisions of any other agreement or document.

        (i) If any property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
attached, garnished or levied upon under an order of court, or the delivery
thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by any order of court, or any other writ,
order, judgment or decree shall be entered or issued by any court affecting such
property, or any part thereof, or any act of the Escrow Agent, then the

<PAGE>   77

Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to use its sole discretion to obey
and comply with all writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered or issued,
whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the case the Escrow Agent obeys and
complies with any such writ, order, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable
to any person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance notwithstanding
the fact that such writ, order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

        (j) The parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not
provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment
of moneys held in the Deposit Escrow Account or the purchase, sale, retention or
other disposition of any investment. Interest and other earnings on investments
shall be added to the Deposit Escrow Account. Any loss or expense incurred as a
result of an investment will be borne by the Deposit Escrow Account. The Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through
the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any
affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to each of the other
parties hereto on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Deposit Escrow
Account for the preceding month. Although each of the other parties recognizes
that it may obtain a broker confirmation or written statement containing
comparable information at no additional cost, such parties hereby agree that
confirmations of investments are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent
for each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. However, no statement
need be rendered for the Deposit Escrow Account if no activity occurred for such
month.

        (k) Any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent
may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation to
which all or any part of the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall
be transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and
immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Section 16.05 Time of Performance. Whenever under the terms hereof the time for
performance of any provision shall fall on a date which is not a regular
business day of the Escrow Agent, the performance thereof on the next succeeding
regular business day of the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to be in full
compliance.

Section 16.06 Interpleader. If any dispute or controversy arises or conflicting
instructions from Buyer and Seller are received respecting the administration or
disposition of the Deposit, or any part thereof, and such dispute or controversy
has not been submitted to arbitration as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, or at
any time, in its sole discretion, the Escrow Agent shall have the right but not
the obligation to interplead the parties to such dispute or controversy in any
court of competent jurisdiction and to deposit with such court the Deposit
remaining in the Deposit Escrow Account, or any portion thereof. Thereafter the
Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged from all further obligations
hereunder with respect to that portion of the Deposit deposited with the court
in such proceedings, except in the case of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

<PAGE>   78

Section 16.07 Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent
resigns or is removed, then Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree upon and name
a substitute for the Escrow Agent ("Successor Escrow Agent"), which shall be a
bank or trust company and which shall perform the same duties and
responsibilities, and which shall be entitled to the same protection as the
original Escrow Agent named herein. The Escrow Agent shall have the unequivocal
right to resign as Escrow Agent upon at least ten (10) days' prior written
notice delivered to Buyer and Seller; provided, that, in any event, such
resignation shall not be effective until such time as a Successor Escrow Agent
has been appointed, has accepted its appointment and has taken possession of the
Deposit. Upon mutual agreement by Buyer and Seller, the Escrow Agent may be
removed upon not less than five (5) days' prior written notice; provided, that,
in any event, such removal shall not be effective until such time as a Successor
Escrow Agent has been appointed, has accepted its appointment and has taken
possession of the Deposit. In either of said events, if a Successor Escrow Agent
is not appointed within the periods noted above, the Escrow Agent, Buyer or
Seller may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to name a Successor Escrow
Agent, whether by interpleader or other appropriate action, and the decision of
such court shall be binding upon all parties to this Agreement.

Section 16.08 Compensation of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent has agreed to serve
hereunder for such fees as are set forth in Exhibit B, which fees are to be paid
as described in Exhibit B.

Section 16.09 Amendment and Termination. This Agreement may be amended or
terminated only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and each of Buyer and
Seller. Once the Deposit has been fully distributed, this Agreement shall
terminate and the Escrow Agent shall be fully discharged and shall have no
further duties or responsibilities hereunder; provided, however, that the
compensation and expense reimbursement provisions and the exculpatory and
indemnification provisions of Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 8 shall survive
termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent.

Section 16.10 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given under this Agreement by any party shall be in writing and shall be

                             BONUS ESCROW AGREEMENT

        BONUS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of April [__], 2001,
by and among ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), HORSESHOE
GAMING HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation ("HGHC"), and AMERICAN NATIONAL
BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CHICAGO (the "Escrow Agent").

                                    RECITALS:

               A. Buyer and HGHC are parties to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of April 12, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"). Capitalized terms
used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings
assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement.

               B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, HGHC is depositing or
causing to be deposited TWO MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND TWO
HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR Dollars ($2,476,264) (the "Initial Retention Bonus Amount")
for the purpose of reimbursing Joliet for amounts paid to certain employees of
Joliet under the Retention Bonus Plan. All funds deposited by HGHC with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, together with
the interest earned thereon, shall be known as the "Retention Bonus Amount."
Buyer and HGHC desire that the Escrow Agent hold such Retention Bonus Amount as
provided in this Agreement and Escrow Agent is willing to enter into this
Agreement and perform as required herein.

               NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, agree as
follows:

        Receipt of Retention Bonus Amount; Bonus Escrow Account. By its
signature below, the Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt from HGHC of the Initial
Retention Bonus Amount. The Escrow Agent shall establish an account (the "Bonus
Escrow Account") for HGHC and place the Initial Retention Bonus Amount therein.
HGHC and the Escrow Agent agree that the Retention Bonus Amount shall be held in
the Bonus Escrow Account and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement.

                              Investment of Funds.

The Retention Bonus Amount shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent,
 as directed in writing by HGHC, in (a) bonds, treasury notes or other evidences
 of indebtedness of, and those instruments unconditionally guaranteed as to the
 payment of principal and interest by, the United States or (b) money market
 accounts, regular depository accounts, certificates of deposit of banks or
 trust companies (including, without limitation the Escrow Agent) organized
 under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, each of which has
 combined capital, surplus and retained earnings of at least One Billion
 Dollars; provided, that any investment instrument shall have the ability to be
 liquidated upon seventy-two (72) hours notice. In investing and



<PAGE>   85

reinvesting any such monies, the Escrow Agent shall act only pursuant to a
letter of direction executed by a representative of HGHC. In the absence of
investment direction as described above, the Escrow Agent shall invest the
deposit in the One Group Prime Money Market Fund Class A Shares.

The interest earned on the Retention Bonus Amount shall be paid to HGHC, and
HGHC shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes thereon. HGHC's federal
tax identification number is 88-0425131.

                     Disposition of Retention Bonus Amount.

The funds in the Bonus Escrow Account shall be held by the Escrow Agent in trust
pending the ninety (90) day anniversary of the Closing Date. Not less than ten
(10) days prior to the ninety (90) day anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause Joliet to deliver to HGHC and the Escrow Agent, a list (the "Bonus
List"), of (i) the persons entitled to a distribution pursuant to the Retention
Bonus Plan (each a "Retained Employee") and (ii) the amount to be paid to each
Retained Employee pursuant to the Retention Bonus Plan (each a "Retention
Payment" and the aggregate of such amounts the "Disbursement Amount"). On the
ninety (90) day anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Joliet to
deliver to HGHC and the Escrow Agent a certification specifying any changes to
the Bonus List as of such date (the "Bonus Certification"). Subject to Section
3.2, upon receipt of the Bonus Certification, HGHC shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to deliver the Disbursement Amount to Joliet. Upon receipt of the
Disbursement Amount, Joliet shall disburse the appropriate Retention Payment to
each Retained Employee. The remaining balance of the Retention Bonus Amount, if
any, (the "Balance") shall be promptly distributed by the Escrow Agent to HGHC
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Within five (5) days of receipt of the Bonus List, HGHC may notify the Escrow
Agent and Buyer in writing of its claim that one or more persons indicated on
the Bonus List are not entitled to all or any portion of the applicable
Retention Payment indicated thereon (a "Disbursement Notice"). HGHC shall, in
reasonable detail, cite the reasons for its claims and the facts and
circumstances supporting its claims regarding the Retention Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to state in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances supporting the claims indicated in the Disbursement Notice
shall not invalidate the Disbursement Notice to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent will send notice of the claims to Buyer and unless Buyer notifies the
Escrow Agent and HGHC of its objection within five (5) days of the Escrow
Agent's notice ("Objection Notice"), the Escrow Agent shall deduct the amount
indicated by HGHC in the Disbursement Notice (the "Disputed Amount") from the
Disbursement Amount, such amount shall become a portion of the Balance and the
Retention Payments to be disbursed by Joliet shall be reduced as specified in
the Disbursement Notice. If Buyer delivers an Objection Notice to the Escrow
Agent and HGHC in accordance with this Section 3.2, the Escrow Agent shall
release the Disbursement Amount less the Disputed Amount to Buyer and the
dispute between Buyer and HGHC regarding the Disputed Amount shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 3.3.



<PAGE>   86

Buyer and HGHC agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
dispute that may arise with respect to this Agreement. At any time, Buyer or
HGHC believes that a dispute exists between them with respect to this Agreement,
it shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other parties and the Escrow
Agent. Any dispute which has not been settled or resolved within thirty (30)
days after receipt by Buyer or HGHC of the notice thereof, as the case may be,
shall be submitted for binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, in an
arbitration proceeding that, except as may otherwise be provided therein, shall
be conducted by the arbitration tribunal in the same manner as the arbitration
referenced in Section 12.04 of the Merger Agreement. The arbitration tribunal's
decision shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties and the Escrow Agent.
As soon as a decision has been made, the arbitration tribunal shall promptly
deliver such decision to each of the parties hereto, and the Disputed Amount
shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent as directed by the arbitration tribunal
in such notice. Each party hereto agrees to provide notice in writing of the
commencement of any such arbitration proceeding to the Escrow Agent and the
other parties, as the case may be.

Responsibilities of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent's acceptance of its duties
under this Agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions, which
shall govern and control with respect to its rights, duties, liabilities and
immunities:

The Escrow Agent makes no representations or warranties and has no
responsibilities as to the correctness of any statement contained herein, and
the Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as to the performance of any
obligation under any agreement or document other than this Agreement.

The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written notice, request,
waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document from either Buyer or HGHC,
not only as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its
provisions, but also as to the truth of any information therein contained and
what it purports to be. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
order, judgment, certification, demand, instruction, notice, instrument or other
writing delivered to it in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any
fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of service thereof. The Escrow
Agent may act or fail to act in reliance upon any instrument comporting with the
provisions of this Agreement or signature believed by it, without independent
investigation, to be genuine and may assume that any person purporting to give
notice or advice or make any statement or execute any document in connection
with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

The sole duty of the Escrow Agent, other than as herein specified, shall be to
receive the Initial Retention Bonus Amount and hold it and any interest earned
thereon subject to release, in accordance with the written instructions of Buyer
or HGHC or as otherwise provided for herein, and the Escrow Agent shall be under
no duty to determine whether the Buyer and/or HGHC are complying with
requirements of the Merger Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations shall
be inferred from this Agreement against the Escrow Agent, nor shall the Escrow
Agent be bound by the provisions of any agreement beyond the specific terms
hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein and shall neither be obligated to recognize nor have
any liability or responsibility arising under any other



<PAGE>   87

agreement to which the Escrow Agent is not a party, even though reference
thereto may be made herein. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as
to the performance of any obligation under any agreement or document, including,
without limitation, the Merger Agreement or any agreements and documents
referred to herein or therein nor shall the Escrow Agent be under any obligation
to take any legal action in connection with this Agreement or towards its
enforcement or performance or to appear in, prosecute or defend any action or
legal proceeding in connection herewith.

Except as set forth in Sections 4.6, 4.7 and 8, the Escrow Agent does not have
any interest in the Retention Bonus Amount, but is serving as escrow holder only
and has only possession thereof.

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any
mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection herewith, except as may result from its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it in accordance with the advice of
such counsel. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation on account of
this Agreement, it shall have the right to retain counsel and shall have a first
lien on the property deposited hereunder for any and all costs, attorneys' fees,
charges, disbursements and expenses in connection with such litigation; and
shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited
hereunder, and if it shall be unable to reimburse itself from the property
deposited hereunder, the parties hereto jointly and severally agree to pay to
the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable charges, counsel and attorneys' fees,
disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and any statement made in Section 4.7, if the litigation or other
proceeding in respect of which the Escrow Agent is entitled to reimbursement
arose from a claim by Buyer against HGHC or HGHC against Buyer, then the losing
party to such litigation (the "Losing Party") only shall bear the Escrow Agent's
attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in connection with such
litigation or other proceeding. The Losing Party also agrees (i) to bear the
attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses of the party prevailing in
such litigation or other proceeding (the "Prevailing Party") and (ii) to
indemnify the Prevailing Party for any portion of the Retention Bonus Amount to
which the Prevailing Party would otherwise be entitled but for the use by the
Escrow Agent of such funds to pay the attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements
and expenses of such litigation or other proceeding.

The Buyer and HGHC, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent
against and save it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs,
payments and expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (who
may be selected by the Escrow Agent), incurred as a result of or in connection
with the performance of this Agreement, except as a result of the Escrow Agent's
own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, that costs and expenses
shall be advanced to the Escrow Agent until a final unappealable determination
has been made that the Escrow Agent is not entitled to indemnification. The
Escrow Agent shall have a first lien on the property deposited hereunder for any
and all amounts due under this Section; and



<PAGE>   88

shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited
hereunder if such amounts have not been paid within thirty (30) calendar days of
a written demand.

The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are solely ministerial in nature, and
the Escrow Agent shall not have any liability under, or duty to inquire into,
the terms and provisions of any other agreement or document.

If any property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be attached, garnished
or levied upon under an order of court, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed
or enjoined by any order of court, or any other writ, order, judgment or decree
shall be entered or issued by any court affecting such property, or any part
thereof, or any act of the Escrow Agent, then the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized to use its sole discretion to obey and comply with all
writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered or issued, whether with or
without jurisdiction, and in the case the Escrow Agent obeys and complies with
any such writ, order, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any person,
firm or corporation by reason of such compliance notwithstanding the fact that
such writ, order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

The parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide
supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment of
moneys held in the Bonus Escrow Account or the purchase, sale, retention or
other disposition of any investment. Interest and other earnings on investments
shall be added to the Bonus Escrow Account. Any loss or expense incurred as a
result of an investment will be borne by the Bonus Escrow Account. The Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through
the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any
affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to each of the other
parties hereto on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Bonus Escrow
Account for the preceding month. Although each of the other parties recognizes
that it may obtain a broker confirmation or written statement containing
comparable information at no additional cost, such parties hereby agree that
confirmations of investments are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent
for each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. However, no statement
need be rendered for the Bonus Escrow Account if no activity occurred for such
month.

Any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be
merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation to
which all or any part of the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall
be transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and
immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.



<PAGE>   89

        Time of Performance. Whenever under the terms hereof the time for
performance of any provision shall fall on a date which is not a regular
business day of the Escrow Agent, the performance thereof on the next succeeding
regular business day of the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to be in full
compliance.

        Interpleader. If any dispute or controversy arises respecting the
administration or disposition of the Retention Bonus Amount, or any part
thereof, and such dispute or controversy has not been submitted to arbitration
as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, or at any time, in its sole discretion, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right but not the obligation to interplead the
parties to such dispute or controversy in any court of competent jurisdiction
and to deposit with such court the Retention Bonus Amount remaining in the Bonus
Escrow Account, or any portion thereof. Thereafter the Escrow Agent shall be
fully released and discharged from all further obligations hereunder with
respect to that portion of the Retention Bonus Amount deposited with the court
in such proceedings, except in the case of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

        Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent resigns or
is removed, then Buyer and HGHC shall mutually agree upon and name a substitute
for the Escrow Agent ("Successor Escrow Agent"), which shall be a bank or trust
company and which shall perform the same duties and responsibilities, and which
shall be entitled to the same protection as the original Escrow Agent named
herein. The Escrow Agent shall have the unequivocal right to resign as Escrow
Agent upon at least ten (10) days' prior written notice delivered to Buyer and
HGHC; provided, that, in any event, such resignation shall not be effective
until such time as a Successor Escrow Agent has been appointed, has accepted its
appointment and has taken possession of the Retention Bonus Amount. Upon mutual
agreement by Buyer and HGHC, the Escrow Agent may be removed upon not less than
five (5) days' prior written notice; provided, that, in any event, such removal
shall not be effective until such time as a Successor Escrow Agent has been
appointed, has accepted its appointment and has taken possession of the
Retention Bonus Amount. In either of said events, if a Successor Escrow Agent is
not appointed within the periods noted above, the Escrow Agent, Buyer or HGHC
may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to name a Successor Escrow Agent,
whether by interpleader or other appropriate action, and the decision of such
court shall be binding upon all parties to this Agreement.

        Compensation of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent has agreed to serve
hereunder for such fees as are set forth in Exhibit B, which fees are to be paid
as described in Exhibit B.

        Amendment and Termination. This Agreement may be amended or terminated
only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and each of Buyer and HGHC. Once
the Retention Bonus Amount has been fully distributed, this Agreement shall
terminate and the Escrow Agent shall be fully discharged and shall have no
further duties or responsibilities hereunder; provided, however, that the
compensation and expense reimbursement provisions and the exculpatory and
indemnification provisions of Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 8 shall survive
termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent.

        Cooperation with Escrow Agent. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate with the Escrow Agent, as the Escrow Agent reasonably deems necessary
or desirable to perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with all
information necessary to make any distribution, including names, addresses,
social security numbers and tax identification numbers. The Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon the most recent information received from any party
without further inquiry and each party shall be responsible for notifying the
Escrow Agent of any new or changed information pertaining to such party.

        Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and
assigns of the parties hereto and shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by each of them and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and
shall not limit or define the meaning hereof. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one instrument. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement shall prove to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
deemed to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement which shall
remain binding on all parties hereto. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof
(except for the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating thereto), and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings of the
parties, oral or written, in connection herewith. This Agreement is a personal
one among Buyer, HGHC and the Escrow Agent and no assignment or attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any right, obligation or interest hereunder by
Buyer or HGHC other than as contemplated herein shall be of any force or effect
unless and until the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall give its
written consent thereto. No person, firm or corporation shall be recognized by
the Escrow Agent as a successor or either Buyer or HGHC until there shall be
presented to the Escrow Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of such
succession.

        Governing Law: Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
construed in accordance with, and governed by, the internal laws of the State of
Illinois as applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within the
State of Illinois. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement may be instituted in any state or federal court
located within the State of Illinois, and each party hereto agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such action, suit
or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of such court in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or
proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may
not be enforced in or by such court. Each party hereto further irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or
proceeding.

                        INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT

               INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of
April [___], 2001, by and among ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), HORSESHOE GAMING HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"),
and AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CHICAGO, as Escrow Agent (the
"Escrow Agent").

                                R E C I T A L S:

A. Buyer and Seller are parties to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
April 12, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to those terms in
the Merger Agreement.

B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Seller is required on this date to deposit
immediately available funds in the amount of THIRTEEN MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($13,950,000) (the "Initial Deposit") with the Escrow Agent for
the purpose of ensuring that certain indemnity payments are made to Buyer. The
Initial Deposit, together with the interest earned thereon, is referred to as
the "Deposit." Buyer and Seller desire that the Escrow Agent hold the Deposit as
provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agent is willing to enter into this
Agreement and perform the services described in this Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, agree as
follows:

1. Receipt of Deposit; Deposit Escrow Account. By its signature below, the
Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt from Seller of the Initial Deposit. The Escrow
Agent shall establish an account (the "Deposit Escrow Account") for Buyer and
Seller and place the Initial Deposit therein. The Escrow Agent agrees that the
Deposit shall be held in the Deposit Escrow Account and disbursed by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement.

2. Investment of Funds.

        2.1 The Deposit shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent, as
jointly directed in writing by Buyer and Seller, in (a) bonds, treasury notes or
other evidences of indebtedness of, and those instruments unconditionally
guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by, the United States, or
(b) money market accounts, regular depository accounts, certificates of deposit
of banks or trust companies (including, without limitation, the Escrow



<PAGE>   96

Agent) organized under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, each
of which has combined capital, surplus and retained earnings of at least One
Billion Dollars; provided, that any investment instrument shall have the ability
to be liquidated upon seventy-two (72) hours notice. In investing and
reinvesting any such monies, the Escrow Agent shall act only pursuant to a
letter of direction executed by a representative of Buyer and of Seller. In the
absence of investment direction as described above, the Escrow Agent shall
invest the deposit in the One Group Prime Money Market Fund Class A Shares.

        2.2 The interest earned on the Deposit shall be paid to Seller and
Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes thereon. The Federal
Tax Identification number of Seller is 88-0425131.

3. Disposition of Deposit.

        3.1 If the Buyer is entitled to receive an indemnity payment pursuant to
Section 12.01 or Article XI of the Merger Agreement, the applicable portion of
the Initial Deposit, without any right of set-off, shall be paid to the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (an "Indemnity Distribution"). Except as provided in
Sections 3.2 or 3.4 below, the Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit only upon
receipt of (i) joint written instructions executed by Buyer and Seller, (ii) an
order of the arbitration tribunal (the "Arbitration Tribunal") pursuant to
Section 12.04 of the Merger Agreement, or (iii) a final non-appealable order of
a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon release of the entire Initial Deposit as
provided for herein, this Agreement shall terminate, and the Escrow Agent shall
be discharged of any further liability.

        3.2 Buyer may notify the Escrow Agent and the Seller in writing of its
claim that it is entitled to receive an Indemnity Distribution to satisfy an
indemnity obligation of the Seller (a "Disbursement Notice"), in the form of
Exhibit A. Buyer shall, in reasonable detail, cite the Section(s) of the Merger
Agreement and the facts and circumstances supporting its claim to receive an
Indemnity Distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to state in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances supporting the claim to the
Initial Deposit shall not invalidate the Disbursement Notice to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent will send notice of the claim to the Seller. Unless the
Seller notifies the Escrow Agent in writing of its objection within ten (10)
calendar days of the Escrow Agent's notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
release the requested Indemnity Distribution to the Buyer as specified in the
Disbursement Notice.

        3.3 If the Seller is entitled to receive the Deposit, or the remaining
portion thereof held by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to Section 13.01 of the
Merger Agreement, such amount shall be paid to the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (a "Deposit Distribution"). Except as provided in Sections 3.2 or 3.4
below, the Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit, or the remaining portion of
the Deposit held by the Escrow Agent, only upon receipt of (i) joint written
instructions executed by Buyer and Seller, (ii) an order of the Arbitration
Tribunal, or (iii) a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction dismissing the McGowan Lawsuit with prejudice. Upon release of the
entire Initial Deposit as provided for herein, this Agreement shall terminate,
and the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of any further liability.



<PAGE>   97

        3.4 Seller may notify the Escrow Agent and the Buyer in writing of its
claim that it is entitled to receive a Deposit Distribution. Seller shall, in
reasonable detail, cite the Section(s) of the Merger Agreement and the facts and
circumstances supporting its claim to receive a Deposit Distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to state in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances supporting the claim to the Initial Deposit shall not
invalidate the notice to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will send notice of
the claim to the Buyer. Unless the Buyer notifies the Escrow Agent in writing of
its objection within ten (10) calendar days of the Escrow Agent's notice, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release the requested Deposit Distribution to the
Seller as specified in the notice given by the Seller pursuant to this Section
3.4.

        3.5 Buyer and Seller agree that any dispute concerning the right to
receive an Indemnity Distribution shall be governed by Section 12.04 of the
Merger Agreement. Each party hereto agrees to provide notice in writing of the
commencement of any arbitration or other dispute arising from Section 12.04 to
the Escrow Agent and the other party, as the case may be.

4. Responsibilities of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent's acceptance of its duties
under this Agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions, which
shall govern and control with respect to its rights, duties, liabilities and
immunities:

        4.1 The Escrow Agent makes no representations or warranties and has no
responsibilities as to the correctness of any statement contained herein, and
the Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as to the performance of any
obligation under any agreement or document other than this Agreement.

        4.2 The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document from either
Buyer or Seller, not only as to its due execution and the validity and
effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth of any information
therein contained and what it purports to be. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, instruction, notice,
instrument or other writing delivered to it in compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of service
thereof. The Escrow Agent may act or fail to act in reliance upon any instrument
comporting with the provisions of this Agreement or signature believed by it,
without independent investigation, to be genuine and may assume that any person
purporting to give notice or advice or make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do
so.

        4.3 The sole duty of the Escrow Agent, other than as herein specified,
shall be to receive the Initial Deposit and hold it and any interest earned
thereon subject to release, in accordance with the written instructions of Buyer
and Seller or as otherwise provided for herein, and the Escrow Agent shall be
under no duty to determine whether the Buyer and/or Seller are complying with
requirements of the Merger Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations shall
be inferred from this Agreement against the Escrow Agent, nor shall the Escrow
Agent be bound by the provisions of any agreement beyond the specific terms
hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein and shall neither be obligated to recognize nor have
any liability or responsibility arising under any other agreement



<PAGE>   98

to which the Escrow Agent is not a party, even though reference thereto may be
made herein. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to inquire as to the
performance of any obligation under any agreement or document, including,
without limitation, the Merger Agreement or any agreements and documents
referred to herein or therein nor shall the Escrow Agent be under any obligation
to take any legal action in connection with this Agreement or towards its
enforcement or performance or to appear in, prosecute or defend any action or
legal proceeding in connection herewith.

        4.4 Except as set forth in Sections 4.6, 4.7 and 8, the Escrow Agent
does not have any interest in the Deposit, but is serving as escrow holder only
and has only possession thereof.

        4.5 The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or
for any mistake of fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from
doing in connection herewith, except as may result from its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

        4.6 The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation on
account of this Agreement, it shall have the right to retain counsel and shall
have a first lien on the property deposited hereunder for any and all costs,
attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in connection with such
litigation; and shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the
property deposited hereunder, and if it shall be unable to reimburse itself from
the property deposited hereunder, the parties hereto jointly and severally agree
to pay to the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable charges, counsel and
attorneys' fees, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and any statement made in Section 4.7, if the
litigation or other proceeding in respect of which the Escrow Agent is entitled
to reimbursement arose from a claim by Buyer against Seller or by Seller against
Buyer, then the losing party to such litigation (the "Losing Party") only shall
bear the Escrow Agent's attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses in
connection with such litigation or other proceeding. The Losing Party also
agrees (i) to bear the attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements and expenses of
the party prevailing in such litigation or other proceeding (the "Prevailing
Party") and (ii) to indemnify the Prevailing Party for any portion of the
Deposit to which the Prevailing Party would otherwise be entitled but for the
use by the Escrow Agent of such funds to pay the attorneys' fees, charges,
disbursements and expenses of such litigation or other proceeding.

        4.7 The Buyer and Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the
Escrow Agent against and save it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities,
costs, payments and expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
(who may be selected by the Escrow Agent), incurred as a result of or in
connection with the performance of this Agreement, except as a result of the
Escrow Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, that costs
and expenses shall be advanced to the Escrow Agent until a final unappealable
determination has been made that the Escrow Agent is not entitled to
indemnification. The Escrow Agent shall have a first lien on the property
deposited hereunder for any and all amounts due under this Section; and shall be
entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited hereunder if
such amounts have not been paid within thirty (30) calendar days of a written
demand.



<PAGE>   99

        4.8 The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are solely ministerial in
nature, and the Escrow Agent shall not have any liability under, or duty to
inquire into, the terms and provisions of any other agreement or document.

        4.9 If any property held by the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be
attached, garnished or levied upon under an order of court, or the delivery
thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by any order of court, or any other writ,
order, judgment or decree shall be entered or issued by any court affecting such
property, or any part thereof, or any act of the Escrow Agent, then the Escrow
Agent is hereby expressly authorized to use its sole discretion to obey and
comply with all writs, orders, judgments or decrees so entered or issued,
whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the case the Escrow Agent obeys and
complies with any such writ, order, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable
to any person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance notwithstanding
the fact that such writ, order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

        4.10 The parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not
provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the investment
of moneys held in the Deposit Escrow Account or the purchase, sale, retention or
other disposition of any investment. Interest and other earnings on investments
shall be added to the Deposit Escrow Account. Any loss or expense incurred as a
result of an investment will be borne by the Deposit Escrow Account. The Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through
the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any
affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent shall send statements to each of the other
parties hereto on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Deposit Escrow
Account for the preceding month. Although each of the other parties recognizes
that it may obtain a broker confirmation or written statement containing
comparable information at no additional cost, such parties hereby agree that
confirmations of investments are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent
for each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. However, no statement
need be rendered for the Deposit Escrow Account if no activity occurred for such
month.

        4.11 Any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent
may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation to
which all or any part of the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent shall
be transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and
immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

5. Time of Performance. Whenever under the terms hereof the time for performance
of any provision shall fall on a date which is not a regular business day of the
Escrow Agent, the performance thereof on the next succeeding regular business
day of the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to be in full compliance.

6. Interpleader. If any dispute or controversy arises or conflicting
instructions from Buyer and Seller are received respecting the administration or
disposition of the Deposit, or any part thereof, and such dispute or controversy
has not been submitted to arbitration as provided in



<PAGE>   100

Section 3.3 hereof, or at any time, in its sole discretion, the Escrow Agent
shall have the right but not the obligation to interplead the parties to such
dispute or controversy in any court of competent jurisdiction and to deposit
with such court the Deposit remaining in the Deposit Escrow Account, or any
portion thereof. Thereafter the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and
discharged from all further obligations hereunder with respect to that portion
of the Deposit deposited with the court in such proceedings, except in the case
of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

7. Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent resigns or is
removed, then Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree upon and name a substitute
for the Escrow Agent ("Successor Escrow Agent"), which shall be a bank or trust
company and which shall perform the same duties and responsibilities, and which
shall be entitled to the same protection as the original Escrow Agent named
herein. The Escrow Agent shall have the unequivocal right to resign as Escrow
Agent upon at least ten (10) days' prior written notice delivered to Buyer and
Seller; provided, that, in any event, such resignation shall not be effective
until such time as a Successor Escrow Agent has been appointed, has accepted its
appointment and has taken possession of the Deposit. Upon mutual agreement by
Buyer and Seller, the Escrow Agent may be removed upon not less than five (5)
days' prior written notice; provided, that, in any event, such removal shall not
be effective until such time as a Successor Escrow Agent has been appointed, has
accepted its appointment and has taken possession of the Deposit. In either of
said events, if a Successor Escrow Agent is not appointed within the periods
noted above, the Escrow Agent, Buyer or Seller may petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to name a Successor Escrow Agent, whether by interpleader or other
appropriate action, and the decision of such court shall be binding upon all
parties to this Agreement.

8. Compensation of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent has agreed to serve hereunder
for such fees as are set forth in Exhibit B, which fees are to be paid as
described in Exhibit B.

9. Amendment and Termination. This Agreement may be amended or terminated only
by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and each of Buyer and Seller. Once the
Deposit has been fully distributed, this Agreement shall terminate and the
Escrow Agent shall be fully discharged and shall have no further duties or
responsibilities hereunder; provided, however, that the compensation and expense
reimbursement provisions and the exculpatory and indemnification provisions of
Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement and the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

10. Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
under this Agreement by any party shall be in writing and shall be delivered
personally, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, by overnight courier or by facsimile transmission, as follows:

one among the Buyers, the Sellers and the Escrow Agent and no assignment or
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any right, obligation or interest
hereunder by the Buyers or the Sellers other than as contemplated herein shall

discretion, shall give

by the Escrow Agent as a successor or either the Buyers or the Sellers until
there shall be presented to the Escrow Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to
it of such succession.

13. Governing Law: Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with, and governed by, the internal laws of the State of Illinois as
applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within the State of
Illinois. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement may be instituted in any state or federal court located within
the State of Illinois, and each party hereto agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper
or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by
such court. Each party hereto further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.

The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will result in Joliet not
having support maintenance or upgrades for the Software. Purchaser acknowledges
that Seller will have no continuing obligation to provide further support
maintenance or upgrades for the Software following the Closing Date.

        (ii) Seller shall retain all right, title and interest in and to, and
Buyer and Joliet shall have no rights in and to the following software:
Complementary Issuance and Management Software version 2, Direct Mail Software
System version 2, Events Management Software System, Points Promotion Management
System version 2, Automated W2G System version 2 and Quick Cash Software System
version 1 and all related trade secrets, technical information, know-how and
processing (collectively, the "Propriety Software"). Seller shall remove the
Propriety Software from the computer system of Joliet prior to the Closing;
provided, that Buyer is entitled to receive and use all computer data that has
been developed, accumulated or maintained for use or manipulation by any of the
Proprietary Software.

        Section 3. Trademarks. Seller hereby grants to Purchaser a nonexclusive,
revocable, royalty-free license to use the trademarks (a) "Inner Circle" and (b)
"Winners Circle" (collectively, the "Trademarks") in connection with the
operation of Joliet during the Transition Period; provided, that: (i) such use
is identical to the use by Joliet prior to the Closing Date; or (ii) Purchaser
obtains Seller's prior written permission for each such use of the Trademarks,
which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that Purchaser
seeks Seller's permission for the use of the Trademarks, Seller shall have two
(2) Business Days from receipt of a written description of Purchaser's proposed
use (including a sample of such use) to either grant or deny Seller's
permission, with such permission deemed granted if Seller does not respond to
Purchaser within the allotted two (2) Business Day period. Purchaser hereby
agrees that any and all use of the Trademarks by Purchaser shall conform to
Seller's quality standards for such use.

        Section 4. Seller's Usage of "Empress" Name. Seller shall be allowed
during the Transition Period to continue to use the "Empress" name solely for
its Hammond property to the extent that such use of the "Empress" name was in
existence and used in an identical manner by Empress Casino Hammond Corporation
in connection with the Hammond property as of the Closing Date, including,
without limitation, on (a) signs, (b) other forms of advertising and (c) chips
and slot tokens. The Indiana Gaming Board has authorized the change of the name
"Empress Casino Hammond Corporation", to "Horseshoe Hammond, Inc." and such name
change will take place as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later
than the end of the Transition Period.

Seller and any of its subsidiaries and Joliet will terminate as of the Closing
Date.

        Section 6. Insurance. Seller acknowledges and agrees to maintain such
policies after the Closing Date to address all insurance claims which relate to
personal injuries occurring prior to the Effective Time. Seller further
acknowledges and agrees that Seller will be



<PAGE>   107

responsible for any and all costs with respect to claims relating to personal
injuries occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, the costs of
deductibles for claims made after the Closing Date for the period prior to the
Effective Time shall be paid by Buyers and such costs shall for purposes of
Article XII of the Merger Agreement be an "Indemnity Loss," as defined in such
Article XII.

        Section 7. Office Space. Purchaser agrees that if for any reason Seller
is unable to relocate its current office space at the office of Joliet prior to
Closing, Seller shall be allowed, subject to the approval of the IGB, to
continue its current occupancy of such office space, for $6,000 per month, until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date HGHC's relocation is completed or (ii)
thirty days after the Closing Date.

        Section 8. Further Assurances. Seller and Purchaser hereby agree to take
any and all additional actions, including, without limitation, the execution,
acknowledgment and delivery of any and all documents reasonably necessary in
order to effect the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

        Section 9. Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may be
amended, modified and supplemented only by written instrument authorized and
executed by Seller and Purchaser. No waiver by any party of any of the
provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and
executed by the party so waiving. The waiver by either party hereto of a breach
of any provisions of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

        Section 10. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder, may otherwise be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by Purchaser without the
prior written consent of Seller and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void. Seller may assign this Agreement in whole or in part or
delegate the performance of some or all of its obligations under this Agreement
upon prior written notice to Purchaser.

        Section 11. Additional Services. The parties have attempted to identify
all services required to be provided to the parties in order to continue the
uninterrupted operation of the Joliet business and Seller's remaining businesses
following the Closing. In the event either Purchaser or Seller require
additional services in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to continue such uninterrupted operation, the parties hereto
agree to negotiate in good faith to provide such additional services upon
mutually agreed terms and conditions.

        Section 12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

by the Merger Agreement are consummated.

        Section 16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
