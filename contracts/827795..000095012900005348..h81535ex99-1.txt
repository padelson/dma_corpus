3.07(a)    v  7   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of October 28, 2000, by and among Stone
Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Partner"), Partner Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Partner ("Merger Sub"), and Basin Exploration, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Partner and Company deem
it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
stockholders that Partner and Company combine in order to advance the long-
term business interests of Partner and Company and each Board of Directors
has recommended that its respective stockholders approve the transactions
contemplated hereby;   WHEREAS, the combination of Partner and Company shall
be effected by the terms of this Agreement through a merger in which the
stockholders of Company will become stockholders of Partner (the
"Merger");   WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, as a condition to the willingness of Partner to enter into this
Agreement, the members of the Board of Directors of Company, in their
capacity as stockholders, are entering into a Voting Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof, with Partner, a copy of which is attached to this Agreement
as Exhibit A-1 (the "Company Voting Agreement"), providing for, among other
things, the agreement of such stockholders to vote their respective shares of
capital stock of Company in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined
herein);   WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, as a condition to the willingness of Company to enter into this
Agreement, the members of the Board of Directors of Partner, in their
capacity as stockholders, are entering into a Voting Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof, with Company, a copy of which is attached to this Agreement
as Exhibit A-2 (the "Partner Voting Agreement") providing for among other
things, the agreement of such stockholders to vote their respective shares of
capital stock of Partner in favor of any required amendment to Partner\'s
certificate of incorporation and the issuance of the shares of Partner Common
Stock (as defined herein) in connection with the Merger at the Partner
Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined herein);   WHEREAS, for federal income
tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"); and   WHEREAS, for
accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall be accounted for as
a pooling of interests.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.   THE
MERGER  SECTION 1.01 Effective Time of the Merger.   Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by the relevant provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") shall be duly
prepared, executed and acknowledged by the Surviving Corporation (as defined
in Section 1.03) and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware for filing, as provided in the DGCL, as early as
practicable on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.02). The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time"). 
8  SECTION 1.02 Closing.   The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by Partner
and Company, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver (as provided by Section 8.05) of the latest to occur
of the conditions set forth in Article VII(other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Brobeck, Phleger and Harrison LLP, Broomfield, Colorado, unless
another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by Partner and
Company.  SECTION 1.03 Effects of the Merger.   At the Effective Time (i)
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Company (Company following the Merger is
sometimes referred to below as the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended so that Article I
of such Certificate of Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: "The
name of the Corporation is Basin Exploration, Inc.," and, as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Partner.  SECTION
1.04 Directors and Officers.   (a) The directors and officers of Merger Sub,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Partner shall take such action so that, upon the
Effective Time, Michael S. Smith shall become a member of Partner\'s Board of
Directors as a Class II Director whose term shall expire in 2001 (whereupon
he will be renominated by Partner as a Class II director for another term).
Without limiting the foregoing, if necessary to comply with this Section
1.04, Partner shall cause the number of directors that shall constitute the
Partner Board of Directors to be increased by resolution of the Partner Board
of Directors.   (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Partner shall, and
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Michael S. Smith to,
enter into a non-competition agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Partner and Michael S. Smith, reflecting the terms set forth
on Appendix 1.04(c) hereto, and which shall become effective as set forth
therein.   ARTICLE II.   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  SECTION 2.01
Conversion of Capital Stock.   As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of
Company Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.01(b)) or capital stock of
Merger Sub:   (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding
share of  the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become
one  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,
par  value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   2  9   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Partner-Owned Stock. All  shares of Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company ("Company  Common Stock") that
are owned by Company as treasury stock and any shares  of Company Common
Stock owned by Partner, Merger Sub or any other  wholly-owned Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 3.01) of Partner or of  Company shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no  stock of Partner or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange  therefor. All shares of Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Partner  ("Partner Common Stock") owned
by Company or any other holder thereof shall  be unaffected by the
Merger.   (c) Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock. (i) Subject to
Section  2.02, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than  shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall
be  converted into the right to receive .3974 of a share of Partner Common 
Stock (the "Exchange Ratio").   (i) As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common  Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a  certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time  represented such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect  thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Partner Common
Stock  and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Partner Common Stock to
be  issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such 
certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.   (ii) If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,  the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Partner Common Stock  are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any  stock split, division
or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse  stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar  transaction, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to  reflect the economic
effects intended by this Section 2.01(c).  Section 2.02 Exchange of
Certificates.   The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock for Partner Common Stock pursuant to the Merger are as
follows:   (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Partner shall
deposit  with a bank or trust company designated by Partner and Company
(the  "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company  Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.02,
through  the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Partner
Common  Stock (such shares of Partner Common Stock, together with any cash 
necessary to pay dividends or distributions with respect thereto and to  make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares as provided below, being 
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to  Section
2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (b)
Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the  Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a 
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time 
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company 
Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into  the
right to receive shares of Partner Common Stock plus cash in lieu of 
fractional shares, if any, of Partner Common Stock as provided below, (i) a 
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, 
and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only  upon
delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall  be in
such form and have such other provisions as Partner and Company may 
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of  the
Company Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares  of
Partner Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of 
Partner Common Stock as provided below). Upon surrender of a Company 
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent  or
agents as may be appointed by Partner, together with such letter of 
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be 
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that 
number of whole shares of Partner Common Stock which such holder has the 
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and  3 
10   cash in lieu of any fractional share of Partner Common Stock as
provided  below, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall immediately
be  cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock  that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, a
certificate  representing the proper number of shares of Partner Common Stock
may be  issued to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such
Company  Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all  documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by
evidence  that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered  as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Company Certificate
shall be  deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to  receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of
Partner  Common Stock and cash, if any, in lieu of any fractional shares of
Partner  Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.02. No interest will
be  paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company
Certificates  pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.   (c)
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or  other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect  to
Partner Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall  be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect  to
the shares of Partner Common Stock represented thereby and no cash  payment
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder  pursuant to
subsection (e) below until the holder of record of such Company  Certificate
shall surrender such Company Certificate. Subject to the effect  of escheat
or similar laws, following surrender of any such Company  Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates  representing whole
shares of Partner Common Stock issued in exchange  therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount  of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of Partner Common Stock  to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to subsection (e) below and the  amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the  Effective Time previously
paid with respect to such whole shares of Partner  Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of  dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective  Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender  payable with respect to such whole
shares of Partner Common Stock. Partner  shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, as needed, cash for these  purposes.   (d) No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares  of Partner Common Stock issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Company  Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid  pursuant to subsection (c) or
subsection (e) of this Section 2.02) shall be  deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to  such shares of Company Common
Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving  Corporation\'s obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other  distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have  been declared or made by Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in  accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (to the extent permitted under  Section 5.01) prior to the date
hereof and which remain unpaid at the  Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Certificates  shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of Company, the stock  transfer books of Company shall be closed
with respect to all shares of  Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time  and from and after the Effective Time there
shall be no further  registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving  Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time,  Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any  reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Section  2.02.   (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip
representing  fractional shares of Partner Common Stock shall be issued upon
the  surrender for exchange of Company Certificates, no dividend or
distribution  of Partner shall relate to such fractional share interests, and
such  fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to  any other rights of a stockholder of Partner. Notwithstanding any
other  provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock  exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to  receive a fraction of a share of Partner Common Stock (after
taking into  account all Company Certificates delivered by such   4 
11   holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an 
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Partner Common Stock 
multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of Partner 
Common Stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Transaction Tape 
(as reported in The Wall Street Journal, or if not reported thereby, any 
other authoritative source) on each of the ten (10) trading days  immediately
preceding the date of the Effective Time.   (f) Termination of Exchange
Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund  that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Certificates for one  hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to  Partner, upon demand, and any
stockholders of Company who have not  previously complied with this Section
2.02 shall thereafter look only to  Partner for payment of their claim for
Partner Common Stock, any cash in  lieu of fractional shares of Partner
Common Stock and any dividends or  distributions with respect to Partner
Common Stock.   (g) No Liability. None of Partner, Company, Merger Sub or
the  Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares
of  Partner Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, for
such  shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from  the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant
to  any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Company  Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years
after the  Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
the  shares of Partner Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate 
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental body 
or authority), any such shares of Partner Common Stock, or cash, dividends 
or distributions in respect of such Company Certificate shall, to the  extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Partner, free  and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled  thereto.   (h)
Withholding Rights. Each of Partner and the Surviving Corporation  shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise  payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company  Common Stock
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with  respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code and  the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of  state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld  by the Surviving
Corporation or Partner, as the case may be, such withheld  amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been  paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of  which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation  or Partner, as the case
may be.   (i) Lost Company Certificates. If any Company Certificate shall
have  been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that  fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen
or  destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by 
such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving  Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made  against it with
respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent  will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company  Certificate the shares
of Partner Common Stock and any cash in lieu of  fractional shares, and
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of  Partner Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this  Agreement.   (j)
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  Company
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Affiliate (as defined  in
Section 6.09) of Company shall not be exchanged until Partner has  received
an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 6.09) from such  Affiliate.  
(k) Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is 
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section  368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby  adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of  Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury  Regulations.   (l)
Accounting Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is  intended to be
treated as a pooling of interests.   5  12   (m) Investment of Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any  cash included in the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Partner, on a daily  basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall  be paid to Partner.   (n)
Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers  and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute  and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, 
bills or sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name  and
on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things  reasonably
required to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in  the Surviving

III.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company represents and
warrants to Partner that the statements contained in this Article III are
true and correct, except as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by Company to Partner and Merger Sub on or before the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other sections in this Agreement only to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that
it also qualifies or applies to such other sections.  SECTION 3.01
Organization of Company.   Each of Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its property and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03(a)).
The copies of Company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws attached to
the Company Disclosure Schedule are complete and correct and in full force
and effect on the date hereof. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any of the provisions of its organizational documents. Except
as set forth in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.04(a)) filed
prior to the date hereof, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for
investment by Company and comprising less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of such company and any interests owned by Company in oil
and gas properties pursuant to joint operating, participation or similar type
agreements. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with
respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the
general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary
of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such
partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other interests
having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board
of Directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned
or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by
such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries.  SECTION 3.02 Company
Capital Structure.   (a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of
50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value, and 10,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of October
6, 2000, (i) 18,516,390 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
not subject to any statutory or contractual preemptive rights  6 
13  (which total includes all shares of Company Common Stock issued as
restricted shares pursuant to the Incentive Plan described below or pursuant
to outstanding share awards under Company\'s Performance Share Plan described
below) and (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held in the treasury
of Company or by its Subsidiaries. The Company Disclosure Schedule shows the
number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for future issuance
pursuant to stock options granted and outstanding as of October 6, 2000 under
Company\'s Equity Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), including the name
of the holder of each option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each such option, the vesting schedule and exercise price per
share and the maximum term of that option. The Company Disclosure Schedule
also indicates the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued as
restricted stock or pursuant to outstanding share awards under Company\'s
Performance Share Plan (the "Performance Share Plan") and the applicable
service requirements or performance milestones for earning those shares. No
material change in such capitalization has occurred between October 6, 2000
and the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the
shares of Company Preferred Stock is issued and outstanding. All shares of
Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified above are
duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in the Incentive Plan or in
the Rights Agreement dated February 24, 1996, as amended (the "Rights
Agreement"), or, with respect to events occurring after the date hereof, to
the extent permitted by Section 5.01, there are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of Company or any Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other voting
security of Company or the capital stock of any Subsidiary or to provide
funds to or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or any other entity other
than guarantees of bank obligations of Subsidiaries entered into in the
ordinary course of business. All of the outstanding shares of, capital stock
of, or other ownership interests in, each of Company\'s Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares
are owned by Company free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, agreements, limitations in Company\'s voting rights, charges or
other encumbrances of any nature.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section
3.02 or as reserved for future grants of options under the Incentive Plan,
or, with respect to events occurring after the date hereof, to the extent
permitted by Section 5.01, there are no equity securities of any class of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any security exchangeable into or
exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. Except as set forth in this Section 3.02 or the Incentive Plan,
or, with respect to events occurring after the date hereof, to the extent
permitted by Section 5.01, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
rights, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights, phantom
equity, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound
obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Company or any
its Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into or
make payment with respect to any such subscription, option, right,
warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, phantom equity,
call, right, commitment or agreement. To the best knowledge of Company, there
are no voting trusts, proxies or other voting agreements or understandings
with respect to the shares of capital stock of Company.  SECTION 3.03
Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a) Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Company have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company, subject
only to the approval of the Merger by Company\'s stockholders under the DGCL.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Company
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Company, enforceable in

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i)
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Company, (ii) assuming that
those of the consents contemplated by Section 3.03(c) of this Agreement, the
failure of which to obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, are obtained, result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default under, or give rise to a penalty or right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material
benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights
or entitlements of any person or entity under (including the receipt of any
consideration), or require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
contract (including, without limitation, any Company Material Contract) or
other agreement, instrument or obligation to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) assuming the consents contemplated by Section
3.03(c) of this Agreement are obtained, conflict with or violate any Permit
(as defined in Section 3.14 below), judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets, except in the
case of (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Section 3.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a correct and complete list of the Company Material Contracts (as defined in
Section 3.10) under which consents, waivers or notifications are required
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which have not previously been obtained.   (c) No consent, approval, order
or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or

or with respect to Company in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for (i) the filing of the pre-merger notification report under the

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under applicable state securities laws and the laws of any foreign country,
(v) such governmental or tribal consents, qualifications or filings as are
customarily obtained or made following the transfer of interests in oil and
gas property interests and (vi) such other consents, authorizations, filings,

SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) Company has made available to
Partner true and complete copies of each registration statement (other than
registration statements on Form S-8), report, proxy statement or information
statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by Company with the SEC
since December 31, 1998, each in the form (including exhibits and any
amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof
(collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), and Company has timely filed all
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant
to relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since such
time. The Company SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time
they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then as and on the date so amended or superseded) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the
statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of Company\'s Subsidiaries
is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or is
otherwise required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the
SEC.  8  15   (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes) contained in the Company SEC
Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented the
consolidated financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments. The unaudited balance
sheet of Company as of June 30, 2000 is referred to herein as the "Company
Balance Sheet."  SECTION 3.05 No Undisclosed Liabilities; Suspense
Accounts.   Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed and
publicly available prior to the date hereof and except for abandonment
obligations related to Company\'s oil and gas properties which are estimated
in the Reserve Report (described in Section 3.21), Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any obligations or liabilities, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
Balance Sheet reflects all suspense accounts owed by Company as of the date
hereof, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.06 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 1999, Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects only in
the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and, since

Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in their accounting methods, principles
or practices to which Partner has not previously consented in writing; (ii)
any declaration, setting aside, or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in respect of the capital stock of Company; (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Company\'s capital stock or any

respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of Company\'s capital
stock (other than under the Incentive Plan or the Performance Share Plan);
(iv) any event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts
that has had, or would be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section
3.06(iv), the effects of (A) any aggregate decrease during any period of 20
consecutive days in the average daily quantity of oil, gas and other
gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons ("Hydrocarbons") being produced by Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is less than 30% of the average
of the net daily production of such Hydrocarbons by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, during the 20-day period ending with the date
of this Agreement or that is caused by mechanical difficulties, surface
equipment, pipeline curtailments or events of force majeure, and (B) any
aggregate net decrease in the proved Hydrocarbon reserves of Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (excluding, for the purpose of determining the
amount of any such decrease, any decrease due to depletion resulting from
production or due to changes in oil and gas prices, and including any
increase due to discoveries or additions) that is less than 20% of the amount
of the Company\'s proved reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Report,
shall not be considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur, provided further, that
any disagreement over the extent of any such reserve decrease shall be
resolved by prompt submittal to an independent reservoir engineer reasonably
acceptable to both parties whose decision shall be binding and shall be
delivered no later than five business days following submittal; (v) (A) any
granting by Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former
director, executive officer or other employee of Company or its Subsidiaries
of any increase in compensation, bonus or other benefits, except for, with
respect to any events occurring prior to the date hereof, normal increases in
base compensation or bonuses in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and set forth on Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and, with respect to events occurring after the date hereof, as
permitted by Section 5.01 or as was required under any employment agreements
in effect as of the date of the most recent  9  16  audited financial

prior to the date hereof, (B) any granting by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any such current or former director, executive officer
or employee of any increase in severance or termination pay, (C) any entry
by Company or any of its Subsidiaries into, or any amendments of, any
employment, deferred compensation, consulting, severance, termination or
indemnification agreement with any current or former director, executive
officer or employee, or (D) any amendment to, or modification of, any Company
stock option or Company warrant; (vi) any tax election or any settlement of
any income tax liability or tax attributes that individually or in the
aggregate is reasonably likely to adversely affect the tax liability or tax
attributes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any material respect or
any settlement or compromise of any material income tax liability; (vii) any
incurrence of indebtedness for money borrowed by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than debt incurred in the ordinary course of business in a
manner consistent with past practice; (viii) any creation of a material lien,
security interest or any other encumbrance, howsoever arising, in respect of
or over any of the material assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(ix) other than, with respect to acquisitions or dispositions occurring after
the date hereof, as would be permitted by Section 5.01, any material

acquisitions of leases at the Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale in March
2000, provided, however, that the exceptions set forth in clauses (A) through

dispositions of assets to, any third parties in which, to Company\'s
knowledge, any officer or director of Company has, directly or indirectly,
any existing or prospective equity or other ownership interest or any other
arrangement or understanding having the same economic effect, other than with
respect to any company that is publicly traded on a national securities
market or exchange, to the extent such ownership interest is less than two
percent (2%) of such publicly traded company; (x) any modification,
assignment, termination or relinquishment of rights under any Company
Material Contract by Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
such modification, assignment, termination or relinquishment in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice; (xi) any damage,
destruction or casualty loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that
individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that the availability of any
insurance coverage shall be taken into account in determining whether such
damage, destruction or loss would be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect); or (xii) any making of a loan or an advance by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of
business.  SECTION 3.07 Taxes.   (a) For the purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "Tax" and, collectively, "Taxes" mean any and all material federal,

would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have, or prior to the Closing Date will have, (A) filed all federal, state,
local and foreign tax returns and reports required to be filed by them prior
to the date of this Agreement (taking into account extensions), (B) paid or

have withheld or collected and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authorities (or are properly holding for such payment) all Taxes required by

authority in a jurisdiction where any of Company and its Subsidiaries does
not file Tax returns that it is or may be subject to taxation in that
jurisdiction. There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or
arrangements affecting any of Company and its Subsidiaries. No payments are
due or will become due by any of Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
such agreement or arrangement or any tax indemnification agreement. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any amount in
income for any taxable period beginning after December 31, 1999 as a result
of a change in accounting or pursuant to any agreement with any Tax authority
with respect to any prior taxable period. Neither Company nor any of its

otherwise. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have entered into any
agreement or arrangement with any Tax authority that requires any of Company
and its Subsidiaries to take any action or to refrain from taking any
action.  SECTION 3.08 Properties.   (a) Except for goods and other
property sold, used or otherwise disposed of since June 30, 2000 in the

for oil and gas purposes to all other properties, interests in properties and
assets, real and personal, reflected in the Company Balance Sheet as owned by
Company and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens,
security interests, charges, mortgages or other encumbrances of any kind
(collectively "Liens"), except: (i) Liens associated with obligations
reflected in the Company Reserve Report or the Company Balance Sheet; (ii)
Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) materialman\'s,
mechanic\'s, repairman\'s, employee\'s, contractor\'s, operator\'s, and other
similar liens, charges or encumbrances arising in the ordinary course of

notices to, filings with, or other actions by governmental entities
in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests
if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance, and

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All leases and other agreements pursuant to which Company or
any of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating
rights affecting any real or personal property are in good standing, valid
and effective and all royalties, rentals and other payments due by the
Company to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid, except
in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All major items of
operating equipment of Company and its Subsidiaries are in good operating
condition and in a state of reasonable maintenance and repair, ordinary wear
and tear excepted, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The
term "Good and Marketable Title" shall, for purposes of this Section 3.08,
with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries, mean such title that: (1) is
deducible of record (from the records of the applicable parish or county or
(A) in the case of federal leases, from the records of the applicable office
of the   11  18  Minerals Management Service or Bureau of Land
Management, (B) in the case of Indian leases, from the applicable office of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, (C) in the case of state leases, from the
records of the applicable state land office) or is assignable to Company or
its Subsidiaries out of an interest of record (as so defined) by reason of
the performance by Company or its Subsidiaries of all operations required to
earn an enforceable right to such assignment; (2) is free from reasonable
doubt to the end that a prudent purchaser engaged in the business of the
ownership, development and operation of producing oil and gas properties with
knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to
accept and pay full value for the same and a prudent lender would be willing
to lend against it as collateral without discount for title matters; (3)
entitles Company or its Subsidiaries to receive not less than the interest
set forth in the Company Reserve Report with respect to each proved property
evaluated therein under the caption "Net Revenue Interest" or "NRI" without
reduction during the life of such property except as stated in the Company
Reserve Report; (4) obligates Company or its Subsidiaries to pay costs and
expenses relating to each such proved property in an amount not greater than
the interest set forth under the caption "Working Interest" or "WI" in the
Company Reserve Report with respect to such property without increase over
the life of such property except as shown on the Company Reserve Report; and
(5) does not restrict the ability of Company or its Subsidiaries to
utilize the properties as currently intended.  SECTION 3.09 Intellectual
Property.   Each of Company and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or
otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use, all trademarks, trade
names, patents, service marks, copyrights, and any applications for such
trademarks, trade names, patents, service marks and copyrights, know-how,
computer software programs or applications and tangible or intangible
proprietary information or material ("Intellectual Property") that are
necessary to conduct the business of Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted, including without limitation, any seismic data or
information used by Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to such exceptions
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.09 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each material agreement pursuant to
which Company or its Subsidiaries licenses or has the right to use or acquire
Intellectual Property (including, without limitation, seismic data or
information). No person or entity has notified either Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that their use of the Intellectual Property infringes on the
rights of any person or entity, subject to such claims and infringements as
do not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any liability on the
part of Company and its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, and to Company\'s knowledge, no person is
infringing on any right of Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to Company\'s
knowledge, threatened that Company or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing
upon the rights of any person or entity with regard to any Intellectual
Property that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.10 Contracts.   (a)
Set forth in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a list of
each contract, lease, indenture, agreement, arrangement or understanding
to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject that would
be required to be included as an exhibit to a Form S-1 Registration
Statement pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC if such a
registration statement were to be filed by the Company on the date hereof and
no previous filings had been made (collectively, the "Company Material
Contracts").   (b) Except for such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to the Company Material Contracts, (A) all
Company Material Contracts are in full force and effect and are the valid and
legally binding obligations of Company or the Subsidiary party thereto, and
to Company\'s knowledge, the legally binding obligations of the other parties
thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception; (B) Company or the Subsidiary
party thereto is not in breach or default (nor does there exist any condition
which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
reasonably be expected to cause such a breach or default) with respect to,
and to the knowledge of Company, no other party to any   12  19  Company
Material Contract is in breach or default with respect to, its obligations
thereunder, including with respect to payments or otherwise; and (C) no party
to any Company Material Contract has given written notice to Company or the
Subsidiary party thereto of any action to terminate, cancel, rescind
or procure a judicial reformation thereof.  SECTION 3.11 Investigations;
Litigation.   Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

(including, without limitation, the retention and severance plan and program
thereunder adopted by Company for its non-executive officer employees (the
"Retention Policy")), written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or relating
to, any current or former employee or other service provider of Company, any
Subsidiary of Company or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
which is treated as a single employer with Company or any Subsidiary of
Company (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code (together, the "Company Employee
Plans").   14  21   (b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan,
Company has made available to Partner, a true and correct copy of (i) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS for each Company
Employee Plan with respect to which such report is required to be filed, (ii)
each trust agreement and group annuity contract or insurance policy, if any,

maintained or contributed to, any plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA
(including without limitation a multiemployer plan within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA), Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified

maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all
applicable laws, including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, and, except
as set forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each such
plan has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service regarding such qualified status. Except as set forth in Section
3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no termination or
partial termination of any such plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Affected participants were fully vested in
their plan accounts as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code in connection with the partial termination described in Section
3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. There are no actions, suits or
claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to Company\'s
knowledge, threatened against, or with respect to, any of the Company
Employee Plans or their assets. There is no matter pending (other than
routine qualification determination filings) with respect to any of the
Company Employee Plans before any Governmental Entity.   (c) With respect to
the Company Employee Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no event has
occurred, and to the knowledge of Company, there exists no condition or set
of circumstances in connection with which Company could be subject to any
material liability under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other
applicable law.   (d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans,
individually and in the aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations
for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are
no unfunded benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, on the financial statements of Company, which
obligations are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, and except as provided for in this Agreement,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written
(i) agreement with any officer or other key employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving Company of
the nature contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any officer of
Company providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee, or (iii)
agreement or plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right
plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of
which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and based on the assumptions set forth therein (which
assumptions represent the best currently available estimates of Company after
consultation with its accountants as to the matters covered thereby, it being
understood that the actual calculation may differ from the assumed amounts),
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, no payments of money or other property, acceleration of benefits,
or provisions of other rights have or will be made hereunder, under any
agreement contemplated herein, under any agreement described in Section
3.13(e) or Section 3.16(e)(determined without regard to whether such
agreement is terminable by Company, without material cost to Company, with no
more than 30 days notice)  15  22  or under the Company Employee Plans
that would be reasonably likely to result in imposition of the sanctions
imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, whether or
not some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment, acceleration, or provision to be triggered. Partner represents and
warrants that nothing has come to Partner\'s attention as of the date hereof
that causes Partner to believe that Section 3.13(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is incorrect.  SECTION 3.14 Compliance With Laws.   Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation or default of, or has
received any notices of violation or default with respect to, any applicable
federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, order, decree
or regulation, including without limitation, any filing or reporting
requirement thereunder with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its business, except for violations or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has all
licenses, franchises, permits, authorizations, approvals, plans, surveys and
environmental impact reports ("Permits") legally required to enable it to
carry on its business as currently carried on and such Permits are all in
full force and effect and no proceeding is pending and neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any action seeking
the revocation or limitation of or is in default or violation of, any such
Permit, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty in this Section 3.14 is made with
respect to Permits issued pursuant to Environmental Laws, which are covered
exclusively by the provisions set forth in Section 3.12, or with respect to
Permits to conduct exploratory operations which have not been commenced as of
the date of this Agreement.  SECTION 3.15 Tax Matters.   To its
knowledge, after consulting with its Tax counsel, neither Company nor any of
its Affiliates (as defined in Section 6.09) has taken or agreed to take any
action that would prevent the Merger from constituting a
transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code.  SECTION 3.16 Labor Matters.   (a) Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor organization, nor, as of the date hereof, is
Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding
asserting that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair
labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization nor, as of the date of this Agreement, is there
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of Company,
threatened, any material labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-
down or lockout involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any current union
organizing activities among the employees of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, nor does any question concerning representation exist
concerning such employees.   (c) Company and its Subsidiaries are and have
been in compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and
employment practices (including without limitation with respect to
discrimination and harassment) and all laws, ordinances and regulations
respecting the terms and conditions of employment, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act"), or any
similar state or local law, in each case that would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Company has listed in Section
3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and has provided to Partner complete
and correct copies of, all employment and consulting agreements with any
current or former employees or consultants currently in effect to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and that are   16  23  not
terminable in Company\'s sole discretion, without material cost to
Company, with no more than 30 days notice.  SECTION 3.17 Insurance.  
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with
reputable companies, reasonably adequate for the operation of their business
and consistent in all material respects with industry practice, including
without limitation, as to amounts and types of coverage.  SECTION 3.18 No
Existing Discussions.   As of the date of this Agreement, Company has
ceased, and has instructed its directors, officers, financial advisors,
representatives, employees and agents to cease, all direct and indirect
discussions and negotiations with any other party that were ongoing
immediately prior to the date hereof with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(as defined in Section 6.01).  SECTION 3.19 Opinion of Financial
Advisor.   The financial advisor of Company, Goldman, Sachs and Co., has
delivered to Company an opinion dated the date of this Agreement to the
effect that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of Company Common Stock from a
financial point of view. Company has delivered, or will deliver promptly
after receipt of such written opinion, a copy of such written opinion to
Partner.  SECTION 3.20 Section 203 of the DGCL Not Applicable.   Company
and its Board of Directors have each taken all action required to be taken by
it in order to exempt the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by Company, the consummation of the Merger by Company and
the transactions contemplated hereby from, and this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from, the restrictions
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business combination"
(as defined in Section 203). No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation is
applicable to Company or (by reason of Company\'s participation therein) the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company and
its Board of Directors have each taken all action required to be taken by it
in order to exempt Partner from the status of an "Acquiring Person" under the
Rights Plan and to ensure that no stock acquisition date, distribution date
or triggering event shall occur by reason of the execution of this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger.  SECTION 3.21 Oil and Gas Reserves.  
Company has furnished Partner the Company\'s estimates of Company\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' oil and gas reserves as of June 30, 2000 in a report as
described in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company
Reserve Report"). Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data on which
the Company Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and
gas reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Report and in any supplement
thereto or update thereof furnished to Partner was accurate and incorporates
the following: the interests owned by Company and its Subsidiaries at the
time the Company Reserve Report was prepared, the cost of operating the
properties, all production and cost data adjusted for all oil and/or gas
imbalances due, all tests and operations on Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
properties of which Company was aware at the time the Company Reserve Report
was prepared and all capital costs reasonably expected by Company at such
time to be necessary to operate, develop and plug and abandon the properties
described therein. To the best knowledge of Company, and based on the
information given to Company by third-party operators for all wells not
operated by Company, the Company Payout Balances (as defined below) for each
of the wells as used in the Company Reserve Report were accurate as of the
dates to which Company had calculated them, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. "Company Payout
Balances"   17  24  means the status, as of the dates of Company\'s
calculations, of the recovery by Company or a third party of a cost amount
specified in the contract relating to a well out of the revenue from such
well where the net revenue interest of Company therein will be reduced or
increased when such amount has been recovered.  SECTION 3.22 Take-or-Pay
Deliveries.   Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are
no calls (exclusive of market calls) on Company\'s oil or gas production and
Company has no obligation to deliver oil or gas pursuant to any take-or-pay,
prepayment or similar arrangement without receiving full payment therefor.
Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Company\'s
estimates of its imbalances in gas production as of September 30, 2000. The
Company does not have any other imbalances in gas production that,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 3.23 Hedging.   Company has set
forth in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule a summary of
Company\'s position with respect to its futures, hedge, swap, collar, put,
call, floor, cap, option or other contracts that are intended to
benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in
the price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons, or securities
(collectively, "Hedges") as of the date hereof. Except as set forth in
Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is bound by any Hedges as of the date hereof.  SECTION
3.24 Required Vote of Company Stockholders.   The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is
required to approve the Merger. No other vote of the stockholders of Company
is required by law, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Company or
otherwise in order for Company to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby.   ARTICLE IV.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
PARTNER   Partner represents and warrants to Company that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct, except as set forth in the
disclosure schedule delivered by Partner to Company and Merger Sub on or
before the date of this Agreement (the "Partner Disclosure Schedule"). The
Partner Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Agreement and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other sections in this Agreement
only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other
sections.  SECTION 4.01 Organization of Partner and Merger Sub.   Each of
Partner and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its property and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Partner
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03(b)). The copies of
Partner\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws attached to the Partner
Disclosure Schedule are complete and correct and in full force and effect on
the date hereof. Neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of any of the provisions of its organizational documents. Except as set forth
in the Partner SEC Reports (as defined in Section 4.04(a)) filed prior to the
date hereof, neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other   18  25  business association or
entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded company held for
investment by Partner and comprising less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of such company and any interests owned by Partner in oil
and gas properties pursuant to joint operating, participation or similar type
agreements.  SECTION 4.02 Partner Capital Structure.   (a) The authorized
capital stock of Partner consists of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.01
par value, and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value ("Partner
Preferred Stock"). As of October 27, 2000, (i) 18,515,725 shares of Partner
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to any statutory or contractual
preemptive rights and (ii) no shares of Partner Common Stock were held in the
treasury of Partner or by its Subsidiaries. The Partner Disclosure Schedule
shows the number of shares of Partner Common Stock reserved for
future issuance pursuant to stock options granted and outstanding as of
October 27, 2000, under Partner\'s 2000 Amended and Restated Stock Option
Plan and Partner\'s 1993 Non-employee Directors Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the "Partner Stock Plans"), and the plans under which such
options were granted. No material change in such capitalization has occurred
between October 27, 2000 and the date of this Agreement. As of the date of
this Agreement, none of the shares of Partner Preferred Stock is issued and
outstanding. All shares of Partner Common Stock subject to issuance as
specified above are duly authorized and, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in
the Partner Stock Plans or in the Rights Agreement dated October 15, 1998
(the "Rights Agreement"), or, with respect to events occurring after the date
hereof, to the extent permitted by Section 5.02, there are no
obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Partner or any Subsidiary to issue,
transfer, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock or other voting security of Partner or the capital stock of any
Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any material investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such Subsidiary or
any other entity other than guarantees of bank obligations of Subsidiaries
entered into in the ordinary course of business. All of the outstanding
shares of, capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of
Partner\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such shares are owned by Partner free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in
Partner\'s voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature.  
(b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.02 or as reserved for future grants
of options under the Partner Stock Plans, or, with respect to
events occurring after the date hereof, to the extent permitted by Section
5.02, there are no equity securities of any class of Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such
equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except as
set forth in this Section 4.02, the Partner Stock Plans, awards granted under
the Partner Stock Plans, and Partner\'s 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, as of the
date hereof, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, rights,
warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation rights, phantom equity,
calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which Partner or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound obligating Partner
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of Partner or any of
its Subsidiaries or obligating Partner or any its Subsidiaries to grant,
extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into or make payment with respect
to any such subscription, option, right, warrant, convertible security, stock
appreciation right, phantom equity, call, right, commitment or agreement. To
the best knowledge of Partner, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other
voting agreements or understandings with respect to the shares of capital
stock of Partner.  SECTION 4.03 Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and
Consents.   (a) Each of Partner and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Partner and Merger Sub have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of each of Partner and Merger Sub
(including the approval of the Merger by Partner as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub), subject only to the approval of the Partner Voting Proposal (as
defined in Section 6.05) by Partner\'s   19  26  stockholders. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Partner and Merger
Sub and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Partner and
Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.   (b) The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Partner and Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with,
or result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Partner or Merger Sub, (ii) result in any
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default under, or give rise to a penalty or right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated
or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any person or entity under (including
the receipt of any consideration), or require a consent or waiver under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, contract (including, without limitation, any Partner
Material Contract) or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which
Partner or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any
of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) assuming the consents
contemplated by Section 4.03(c) of this Agreement are obtained, conflict with
or violate any Permit, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation applicable to Partner or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
or their properties or assets, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations
or accelerations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.03(b)
of the Partner Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of
the Partner Material Contracts (as defined in Section 4.10) under which
consents, waivers or notifications are required prior to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which have not previously
been obtained.   (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required

obtained or made following the transfer of interests in oil and gas property
interests and (vii) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals
and registrations that, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably
likely to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 4.04 SEC
Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) Partner has made available to Company
true and complete copies of each registration statement (other than
registration statements on Form S-8), report, proxy statement or information
statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by Partner with the SEC
since December 31, 1998, each in the form (including exhibits and any
amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof
(collectively, the "Partner SEC Reports"), and Partner has timely filed all
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant
to relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since such
time. The Partner SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, as the case may be, and (ii)
did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then as and on the date so amended or
superseded) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated in such Partner SEC Reports or
necessary in order to make the statements in such Partner SEC Reports, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of Partner\'s Subsidiaries is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC.   20  27   (b) Each of the consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes) contained
in the Partner SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and
fairly presented the consolidated financial position of Partner and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments. The unaudited balance sheet of Partner as of June 30,
2000 is referred to herein as the "Partner Balance Sheet."  SECTION 4.05 No
Undisclosed Liabilities; Suspense Accounts.   Except as disclosed in the
Partner SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof and
except for abandonment obligations related to Partner\'s oil and gas
properties that are estimated in the Partner Reserve Report (described in
Section 4.17), Partner and its Subsidiaries do not have any obligations or
liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that
individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be likely to have a Partner
Material Adverse Effect. The Partner Balance Sheet reflects all
suspense accounts and gas balancing obligations owed by Partner as of the
date hereof, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Partner
Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 4.06 Absence Of Certain Changes Or
Events.   Except as disclosed in the Partner SEC Reports filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 1999, Partner and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects only in
the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and, since
such date, there has not been (i) any material change by Partner and its
Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in their accounting methods, principles
or practices to which Company has not previously consented in writing; (ii)
any declaration, setting aside, or payment of any dividend or other
distribution in respect of the capital stock of Partner; (iii) any split,
combination or reclassification of any of Partner\'s capital stock or any
issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in
respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of Partner\'s capital

facts that has had, or would be reasonably likely to have, a Partner Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section
4.06(iv), the effects of (A) any aggregate decrease during any period of 20
consecutive days in the average daily quantity of oil, gas and other gaseous
and liquid hydrocarbons ("Hydrocarbons") being produced by Partner and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is less than 30% of the average of the
net daily production of such Hydrocarbons by the Partner and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, during the 20-day period ending with the
date of this Agreement or that is caused by mechanical difficulties, surface
equipment, pipeline curtailments or events of force majeure, and (B) any
aggregate net decrease in the proved Hydrocarbon reserves of Partner and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (excluding, for the purpose of determining the
amount of any such decrease, any decrease due to depletion resulting from
production or due to changes in oil and gas prices and any increase due to
discoveries or additions) that is less than 20% of the amount of the
Partner\'s proved reserves set forth in the Partner Reserve Report, shall not
be considered in determining whether a Partner Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or is reasonably likely to occur, provided, further, that any
disagreement over the extent of any such reserve decrease shall be resolved
by prompt submittal to an independent reservoir engineer reasonably
acceptable to both parties whose decision shall be binding and shall be
delivered no later than five business days following submittal; (v) any tax

tax liability; (vi) any modification, assignment, termination or
relinquishment of rights under any Partner Material Contract by Partner or
any of its Subsidiaries other than such modification, assignment, termination
or relinquishment in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; or (vii) any damage, destruction or casualty loss, whether or not
covered by insurance, that individually or in the aggregate would be
reasonably likely to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect (it being
understood that the availability of any insurance coverage shall be taken
into  21  28  account in determining whether such damage, destruction or
loss would be reasonably likely to have a Partner Material Adverse
Effect).  SECTION 4.07 Taxes.   (a) Except as would not be reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Partner Material Adverse
Effect, (i) Partner and each of its Subsidiaries have, or prior to the
Closing Date will have, (A) filed all federal, state, local and foreign tax
returns and reports required to be filed by them prior to the date of this
Agreement (taking into account extensions), (B) paid or accrued all Taxes due
and payable with respect to the periods covered by such tax returns and

appropriate governmental authorities (or are properly holding for such
payment) all Taxes required by law to be withheld or collected, and (iv)
there are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than liens for Taxes that are not yet due or that are

a jurisdiction where any of Partner and its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
returns that it is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. There
are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or arrangements affecting any of
Partner and its Subsidiaries. No payments are due or will become due by any
of Partner and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement
or any tax indemnification agreement. Neither Partner nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to include any amount in income for any taxable
period beginning after December 31, 1999 as a result of a change in
accounting or pursuant to any agreement with any Tax authority with respect
to any prior taxable period. Neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries (i)
has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income
Tax return (other than a group the common parent of which was Partner) or
(ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any person or entity (other than any
of Partner and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise. Neither Partner nor any of its
Subsidiaries have entered into any agreement or arrangement with any Tax
authority that requires any of Partner and its Subsidiaries to take any
action or to refrain from taking any action.  SECTION 4.08 Properties.

Subsidiaries, and defensible title for oil and gas purposes to all other
properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected
in the Partner Balance Sheet as owned by Partner and its Subsidiaries, free
and clear of any Liens, except: (i) Liens associated with obligations
reflected in the Partner Reserve Report or the Partner Balance Sheet; (ii)
Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) materialman\'s,
mechanic\'s, repairman\'s, employee\'s, contractor\'s, operator\'s, and other
similar liens, charges or encumbrances arising in the ordinary course of
business (A) if they have not been perfected pursuant to law, (B) if
perfected, they have not yet become due and payable or payment is
being withheld as provided by law, or (C) if their validity is being
contested in good faith by appropriate action, (iv) all rights to consent by,
required notices to, filings with, or other actions by governmental entities
in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests
if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance, and
(v) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partner Material
Adverse Effect. All leases and other agreements pursuant to which Partner or
any of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating
rights affecting any real or personal property are in good standing, valid
and effective and all royalties, rentals and   22  29  other payments
due by the Partner to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been
paid, except in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect. All major
items of operating equipment of Partner and its Subsidiaries are in
good operating condition and in a state of reasonable maintenance and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Partner Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) The term "Good and Marketable Title" shall, for purposes of
this Section 4.08, with respect to Partner and its Subsidiaries, mean such
title that: (1) is deducible of record (from the records of the applicable
parish or county or (A) in the case of federal leases, from the records of
the applicable office of the Minerals Management Service or Bureau of Land
Management, (B) in the case of Indian leases, from the applicable office of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, (C) in the case of state leases, from the
records of the applicable state land office) or is assignable to Partner or
its Subsidiaries out of an interest of record (as so defined) by reason of
the performance by Partner or its Subsidiaries of all operations required to
earn an enforceable right to such assignment; (2) is free from reasonable
doubt to the end that a prudent purchaser engaged in the business of the
ownership, development and operation of producing oil and gas properties with
knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to
accept and pay full value for the same and a prudent lender would be willing
to lend against it as collateral without discount for title matters; (3)
entitles Partner or its Subsidiaries to receive not less than the interest
set forth in the Partner Reserve Report with respect to each proved property
evaluated therein under the caption "Net Revenue Interest" or "NRI" without
reduction during the life of such property except as stated in the Partner
Reserve Report; (4) obligates Partner or its Subsidiaries to pay costs and
expenses relating to each such proved property in an amount not greater than
the interest set forth under the caption "Working Interest" or "WI" in the

(5) does not restrict the ability of Partner or its Subsidiaries to
utilize the properties as currently intended.  SECTION 4.09 Intellectual

Property that is necessary to conduct the business of Partner and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, including without limitation, any
seismic data or information used by Partner and its Subsidiaries, subject to
such exceptions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect. No person or
entity has notified either Partner or any of its Subsidiaries that their use
of the Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any person or entity,
subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or in the
aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of Partner and its
Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to have a Partner Material
Adverse Effect, and to Partner\'s knowledge, no person is infringing on any
right of Partner or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to Partner\'s
knowledge, threatened that Partner or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing
upon the rights of any person or entity with regard to any Intellectual
Property that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect.  SECTION 4.10 Contracts.   (a)
Set forth in Section 4.10 of the Partner Disclosure Schedule is a list of
each contract, lease, indenture, agreement, arrangement or understanding
to which Partner or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject that would

registration statement were to be filed by the Partner on the date hereof and

Contracts").   (b) Except for such matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Partner Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to the Partner Material Contracts, (A) all
Partner Material Contracts are in full force and effect and are the valid and
legally binding obligations of Partner or the Subsidiary party thereto, and
to Partner\'s knowledge, the legally binding obligations of the other parties
thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity  23  30  Exception; (B) Partner or
the Subsidiary party thereto is not in breach or default (nor does there
exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would reasonably be expected to cause such a breach or default) with
respect to, and to the knowledge of Partner, no other party to any Partner
Material Contract is in breach or default with respect to, its obligations
thereunder, including with respect to payments or otherwise; and (C) no party
to any Partner Material Contract has given written notice to Partner or the
Subsidiary party thereto of any action to terminate, cancel, rescind
or procure a judicial reformation thereof.  SECTION 4.11 Investigations;

list of all pending Litigation Matters. Except as described in the Partner
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or pursuant to the pre-merger
notification process under the HSR Act with respect to this transaction (i)

Partner Material Adverse Effect or would materially impair or delay the
ability of Partner to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  SECTION 4.12 Environmental Matters.   Except as disclosed in
the Partner SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof
and, in case of clauses (i)-(iv) and (viii)-(ix) and (xi), except for such

that could reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim) is subject
to any indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating to

Section 4.13(a) of the Partner Disclosure Schedule, and has provided to
Company complete and correct copies of, all employee benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance, and
other similar employee benefit plans, written or otherwise, for the benefit
of, or relating to, any current or former employee or other service provider
of Partner, any Subsidiary of Partner or any trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) which is treated as a single employer with Partner or any
Subsidiary of Partner (a "Partner ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code (together, the
"Partner Employee Plans").   (b) With respect to each Partner Employee Plan,
Partner has made available to Company, a true and correct copy of (i) the
most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS for each Partner
Employee Plan with respect to which such report is required to be filed, (ii)
each trust agreement and group annuity contract or insurance policy, if any,

Agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA (including without limitation a multiemployer plan

termination or partial termination of any such plan within the meaning of
Section 411(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. There are no actions, suits
or claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to Partner\'s

material liability under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other
applicable law.   (d) With respect to the Partner Employee Plans,
individually and in the aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations
for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are
no unfunded benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in  25  32  accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, on the financial statements of
Partner, which obligations are reasonably likely to have a Partner Material
Adverse Effect.   (e) Except as disclosed in the Partner SEC Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as provided for in this
Agreement, neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral
or written (i) agreement with any officer or other key employee of Partner or
any of its Subsidiaries, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms
of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
involving Partner of the nature contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agreement with any officer of Partner providing any term of employment or
compensation guarantee, or (iii) agreement or plan, including any stock
option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or stock
purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting
of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  SECTION 4.14 Compliance with Laws.  
Neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation or default of, or
has received any notices of violation or default with respect to,
any applicable federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, order,
decree or regulation, including without limitation, any filing or reporting
requirement thereunder with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its business, except for violations or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Partner Material Adverse Effect. Each of Partner and its Subsidiaries has all
Permits legally required to enable it to carry on its business as currently
carried on and such Permits are all in full force and effect and no
proceeding is pending and neither Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of any action seeking the revocation or
limitation of or is in default or violation of, any such Permit, except in
each case as would not reasonably be expected to have a Partner Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty in this Section 4.14 is made with respect to
Permits issued pursuant to Environmental Laws, which are covered exclusively
by the provisions set forth in Section 4.12, or with respect to Permits to
conduct exploratory operations which have not been commenced as of the date
of this Agreement.  Section 4.15 Tax Matters.   To its knowledge, after
consulting with its Tax counsel, neither Partner nor any of its Affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from
constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 4.16 Opinion of Financial
Advisor.   The financial advisor of Partner, Merrill Lynch and Co., has
delivered to Partner an opinion dated the date of this Agreement to the
effect that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Exchange Ratio is fair to Partner from a financial point of view. Partner has
delivered, or will deliver promptly after receipt of such written opinion, a
copy of such written opinion to Company.  Section 4.17 Oil and Gas
Reserves.   Partner has furnished Company the Partner\'s estimates of
Partner\'s and its Subsidiaries\' oil and gas reserves as of December 31,
1999 in a report as described in Section 4.17 of the Partner Disclosure
Schedule (the "Partner Reserve Report"). Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Partner Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-
interpretive data on which the Partner Reserve Report was based for purposes
of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Partner Reserve
Report and in any supplement thereto or update thereof furnished to Partner
was accurate and incorporates the following: the interests owned by Partner
and its Subsidiaries at the time the Partner Reserve Report was prepared, the
cost of operating the properties, all production and cost data adjusted for
all oil and/or gas imbalances due, all tests and operations on Partner\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' properties of which Partner was aware at the time the
Partner Reserve   26  33  Report was prepared and all capital costs
reasonably expected by Partner at such time to be necessary to operate,
develop and plug and abandon the properties described therein. To the best
knowledge of Partner, and based on the information given to Partner by third-
party operators for all wells not operated by Partner, the Partner Payout
Balances (as defined below) for each of the wells as used in the Partner
Reserve Report were accurate as of the dates to which Partner had calculated
them, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Partner Material
Adverse Effect. "Partner Payout Balances" means the status, as of the dates
of Partner\'s calculations, of the recovery by Partner or a third party of a
cost amount specified in the contract relating to a well out of the revenue
from such well where the net revenue interest of Partner therein will
be reduced or increased when such amount has been recovered. Partner agrees
that Company will have access to the Partner Reserve Report in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 4.17 of the Partner Disclosure
Schedule.  SECTION 4.18 Take-or-Pay Deliveries.   Except as provided in
Partner SEC Reports or in Section 4.18 of the Partner Disclosure Schedule,
there are no calls (exclusive of market calls) on Partner\'s oil or gas
production and Partner has no obligation to deliver oil or gas pursuant to
any take-or-pay, prepayment or similar arrangement without receiving full
payment therefor.  SECTION 4.19 Hedging.   Partner has set forth in
Section 4.19 of the Partner Disclosure Schedule a summary of Partner\'s
position with respect to its Hedges as of the date hereof. Except as set
forth in Section 4.19 of the Partner Disclosure Schedule, neither Partner nor
any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any Hedges as of the
date hereof.  SECTION 4.20 Required Vote of Partner Stockholders.   The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock is required to approve the amendment to
Partner\'s certificate of incorporation to increase its authorized
capitalization. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the
proposal, so long as the total number of votes cast in favor of and against
the proposal represents a majority of the outstanding shares of Partner
Common Stock, is required to approve the issuance of Partner Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger.   ARTICLE V.   CONDUCT OF BUSINESS  SECTION 5.01
Covenants of Company.   During the period from the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, Company agrees as to itself and each of its Subsidiaries
(except to the extent that Partner shall otherwise consent in writing), to
carry on its operations in the usual, regular and ordinary course of business
in substantially the same manner as previously conducted, to pay its debts
and taxes when due subject to good faith disputes over such debts or taxes,
to pay or perform its other obligations when due, and, to the extent
consistent with such business, use all reasonable efforts consistent with
past practices and policies to preserve intact its present business and its
relationships with customers, suppliers and others with whom Company deals in
the ordinary course of its business. Company shall promptly notify Partner of
any material event or occurrence not in the ordinary course of business of
Company. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth
in Section 5.01 of Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to Section 6.01,
Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to), without
the written consent of Partner:   (a) Accelerate, amend or change the period
of exercisability of  options, restricted stock or other awards granted under
any employee stock  plan (including, without limitation, the Incentive Plan
and the Performance  Share Plan) of such party or authorize cash payments in
exchange for any  options granted   27  34   under any of such plans

copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Each party further agrees to work in good faith and use
its reasonable best efforts to satisfy all of the closing conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, but is under no obligation to waive any of such
conditions.   ARTICLE VI.   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  SECTION 6.01 No
Solicitation.   Company shall not, and nor will it authorize or knowingly
permit, directly or indirectly, any officer, director, financial advisor,
representative, employee or agent of Company to, (i) solicit, initiate, or
encourage any proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business
combination, share exchange, recapitalization, sale of all or substantially
all of its assets, sale of shares (other than pursuant to the Incentive Plan
or Performance Share Plan) of capital stock (including without limitation by
way of a tender offer) or similar transaction involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
of the foregoing proposals   30  37  being referred to in this Agreement
as an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) engage in negotiations regarding, or
provide any non-public information to any person or entity relating to, or
take any other action intended to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company, or its Board of
Directors, prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting referred to
in Section 6.05, from (A) furnishing non-public information to, or entering
into negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person or
entity or recommending an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
to the stockholders of Company, if and only to the extent that (1) such
Acquisition Proposal was not made by a person or entity with whom Company has
actively negotiated regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the three (3)
month period prior to the date of this Agreement, (2) Company\'s Board of
Directors (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) determines in
good faith that such action is legally advisable for the Board of Directors
to comply with its fiduciary duties to Company\'s stockholders under
applicable law, (3) such Acquisition Proposal is not subject to any financing
contingencies or is, in the good faith judgment of Company\'s Board of
Directors (after consultation with its financial advisor), reasonably capable
of being financed by such other person or entity, (4) Company\'s Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal
and the person or entity making the proposal, of being completed and would,
if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to Company\'s
stockholders than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such
more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a
"Superior Proposal"), and (5) prior to furnishing such non-public information
to, or entering into negotiations with, such person or entity, Company\'s
Board of Directors received from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms regarding confidentiality and standstill
provisions no less favorable to Company than those contained in the existing
Non-Disclosure Agreement between Partner and Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") and shall have notified Partner of any such Acquisition Proposal,
including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person or entity making such proposal; or (B) complying with Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal.  SECTION 6.02 Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Registration Statement.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Company and Partner shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement (it being understood and agreed that both parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to accomplish this preparation and
filing within three (3) weeks after the date hereof), and Partner shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, provided that Partner may
delay the filing of the Registration Statement until approval of the Joint
Proxy Statement by the SEC. Partner and Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC in connection with the
Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, to furnish all
information required to prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as soon after such filing as practicable. Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Company\'s stockholders, and Partner will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Partner\'s stockholders, in
each case as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act. The Joint Proxy Statement shall
include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company in favor of
this Agreement and the Merger and of the Board of Directors of Partner (which
original recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to Company) in favor of the issuance of Partner Shares pursuant to
the Merger and the amendment of Partner\'s certificate of incorporation
to increase its authorized capitalization; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors of Company may withdraw such recommendation under the
circumstances described in Section 6.01.   (b) Partner and Company shall
make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, applicable state blue sky laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.   31  38   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no party hereto shall be prohibited from making
factual disclosures to such party\'s stockholders to the extent such party is
required to do so by applicable law.  SECTION 6.03 Quotation on Stock

notice, Company and Partner shall each (and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, engineers, consultants and other representative
(including but not limited to external accountants, engineers
and consultants)) to afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, engineers, consultants and other representatives (including but not
limited to external accountants, engineers and consultants) of the other (at
the risk and expense of such inspecting party), subject to each such
inspecting party\'s agreement (which need not be in writing) to be bound by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement or other customary form of
acknowledgement of the confidential nature of the information, reasonable
access for purposes reasonably related to this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of Company
and Partner shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request for purposes reasonably related to this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Unless otherwise required by law, the parties will hold any such information
which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the Merger.  SECTION 6.05 Stockholders
Meetings.   (a) Company and Partner each shall call a meeting of its
respective stockholders to be held as promptly as practicable for the purpose
of voting, in the case of Company, upon this Agreement and the Merger and, in
the case of Partner, upon the issuance of shares of Partner Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger and an amendment to Partner\'s certificate of
incorporation to increase its authorized capitalization (the "Partner Voting
Proposal"). In accordance with Section 251(c) of the DGCL, Company\'s
obligation to call and hold its stockholders meeting shall not be dependent
on Company Board of Directors\' recommendation. Company and Partner shall
coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold such meetings on the same day
and as soon as practicable after the date hereof. Except as otherwise
permitted with respect to Company pursuant to Section 6.01 of this Agreement,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the matters set forth above and obtain a
sufficient vote in favor of such matters at its stockholders meeting (or any
postponement or adjournment thereof). Partner shall take such action with
respect to Merger Sub, and cause Merger Sub to take such action, as may be
required to consummate the Merger, including without limitation, voting all
shares of Merger Sub in favor of the Merger.   (b) Each of Partner and
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its directors
to enter into the Partner Voting Agreement or the Company Voting Agreement,
as the case may be, with respect to the shares owned by such director, as
soon as practicable after the date hereof.   32  39  SECTION 6.06 Legal
Conditions to Merger.   (a) Each of Company and Partner shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and proper under
applicable law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity
or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by it or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery by
it of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby including, without limitation, the Merger, and (iii) as

other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) subject to Section 6.06(b),
the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any other
applicable law. Company and Partner shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing
and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. Company and Partner shall use their
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any applicable law (including all information required to
be included in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement)
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)
Partner and Company agree, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain any government clearances required for Closing
(including through compliance with the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
government reporting requirements), to respond to any government requests for
information, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits
the consummation of the Merger or the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Partner shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such
issues or objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including without limitation as may arise under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulatory laws, rules or regulations of any domestic or
foreign government or any governmental, judicial or multinational authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.06 shall require, or
be construed to require, Partner or Company, in connection with the receipt
of any regulatory approval, to proffer to or agree to (A) sell or hold
separate and agree to sell, divest or to discontinue or limit, before or
after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets
or businesses of Partner, Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or
to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, or discontinuance or limitation
by Partner or Company, as the case may be, of any of its assets
or businesses), or (B) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions
in, the operations of any such assets or businesses which, in either case,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Partner Material Adverse Effect
or a Company Material Adverse Effect or to materially and adversely impact
the economic or business benefits to such party of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act
or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust or fair trade law.   (c)
Each of Company and Partner shall give (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to third parties required to be given by it, and use,
and cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents related to or required in connection with the Merger
required to be obtained by it that are (i) necessary for it to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 3.03(c) of this Agreement or
the Partner Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be or (iii) required to
prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Partner Material Adverse
Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time.   33 
40  SECTION 6.07 Public Disclosure.   Partner and Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation and the express prior written approval of the other party,
except as may be required by law and any applicable stock exchange rules.
With respect to any other press release to be issued by Partner or Company
prior to the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, the party
issuing the press release shall endeavor to provide the other party with a
copy of any such press release by the close of business on the business day
prior to the issuance of such press release or, if such notice
is impracticable to provide, as soon as practicable prior to such
release.  SECTION 6.08 Tax-Free Reorganization.   Partner and Company
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and shall not knowingly take any actions which could
prevent the Merger from being treated as described in this
Section 6.08.  SECTION 6.09 Affiliate Agreements.   Upon the execution of
this Agreement, Company will provide Partner with a list of those persons who
are, in Company\'s reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of Company within the
meaning of Rule 145 (each person who is an "affiliate" within the meaning of
Rule 145 is referred to as an "Affiliate") promulgated under the Securities
Act ("Rule 145"). Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Partner within 30 days after the date hereof (and in
any case prior to the Effective Time) from each of its Affiliates,
an executed Affiliate Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Partner and Company, by which each Affiliate of Company
agrees to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 145 and such
requirements as may be necessary for the Merger to be treated as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes (an "Affiliate Agreement"). Partner shall
be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any
Partner Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates of Company pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the Partner Common Stock, consistent
with the terms of the Affiliate Agreements (provided that such legends or
stop transfer instructions shall be removed, two years after the Effective
Date, upon the request of any stockholder that is not then an Affiliate of
Partner and that otherwise satisfies the resale provisions of Rule 145(d)).
Partner expressly agrees to cause the results of its earnings for a period
following consummation of the Merger that includes at least 30 days of
combined operations of Partner and Company to be publicly released as soon as
reasonably practicable (it being understood that Partner may satisfy this
obligation by filing its regularly prepared quarterly results on Form
10-Q).  SECTION 6.10 New York Stock Exchange Quotation.   Partner shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Partner Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date.  SECTION 6.11 Stock Plans.   (a) At the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company
Stock Option") under the Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested (after
giving effect to any applicable change in control or similar type
provisions), shall, together with the Incentive Plan, be assumed by Partner
and shall thereby be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions in effect for such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Closing Date, that number of shares of Partner Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to that
option immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding out to the next whole number of shares. The exercise price per share
of Partner Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Stock Option
shall be equal to the amount determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of   34  41  Company Common Stock in effect for that Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding up to the nearest whole cent. Subject to the effect of Section
422(d) of the Internal Revenue Code on any Company Stock Option with respect
to which vesting is accelerated in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that each
Company Stock Option so assumed by Partner shall continue to qualify, after
the Closing Date, as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code to the same extent that option qualified as such an
incentive stock option immediately prior to the Closing Date.   (b) As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Partner shall deliver to the
participants in the Incentive Plan, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Company, an appropriate document evidencing the
assumption of each Company Stock Option in accordance with Section 6.11(a) of
this Agreement.   (c) Partner shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Partner Common Stock
for delivery upon the exercise of the Company Stock Options assumed in
accordance with this Section 6.11. As soon as practicable and in no event
more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, Partner shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to the shares of Partner Common Stock subject to such
options or on another appropriate form of registration statement for any such
shares of Partner Common Stock which are not registrable on Form S-8 and
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.   (d) The Board of
Directors of Company (or duly appointed committee thereof that is authorized
to administer the Incentive Plan) shall, prior to or as of the Effective
Time, take all necessary actions, pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the Incentive Plan and the instruments evidencing the Company Stock
Options, to provide for the conversion of the Company Stock Options
into options to acquire Partner Common Stock in accordance with this Section
6.11.   (e) The shares of Company Common Stock currently subject to earn-
out schedules pursuant to the outstanding performance share awards under
the Performance Share Plan shall be earned or forfeited by the holders
thereof at the Effective Time in accordance with the change in control
provisions of such holders\' share awards; provided, however, that any shares
not earned based on the most recently issued year-end financial statement
prior to the Effective Time shall be earned as determined prior to the
Effective Time in good faith by the Compensation and Incentive Committee
under the Performance Share Plan (and subject to the prior approval of
Partner) based on the financial performance of Company during the period
beginning on the first day of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time
occurs and ending on the Closing Date. The earned shares shall, at the
Effective Time, be converted into shares of Partner Common Stock in
accordance with the Exchange Ratio.   (f) The Board of Directors of Company
shall, prior to or as of the Effective Time, take appropriate action to
approve the deemed cancellation of the Company Stock Options for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Board of Directors of Partner shall,
prior to or as of the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve the
deemed grant of options to purchase Partner Common Stock under the Company
Stock Options (as converted pursuant to this Section 6.11) for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The disposition of such shares of Company
Common Stock and the issuance of such shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger shall also be included in the approval process of the Boards of
Directors of Company and Parent for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act. Similar action shall be taken by Company and Partner Boards of Directors
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under the
Performance Share Plan which are to be converted into shares of
Partner Common Stock in the Merger.   (g) If any shares of Company Common
Stock are, immediately prior to the Effective Time, unvested or subject to
any other restrictions under the Incentive Plan or any restricted stock
purchase or stock issuance agreement to which Company is a party and the
vesting schedule or restrictions applicable to those shares are not to vest
or lapse on an accelerated basis in connection with the Merger, then the
shares of Partner Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company
Common Stock in the Merger shall also be unvested  35  42  and subject to
the same vesting schedule in effect for the unvested shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The certificates representing
such shares of Partner Common Stock may accordingly bear the appropriate
restrictive legends.  SECTION 6.12 Brokers or Finders.   Each of Partner
and Company represents, as to itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates,
that no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or
person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other
commission or similar fee in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except Goldman, Sachs and Co.,
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Company in accordance with Company\'s
agreement with such firm (copies of which have been delivered by Company to
Partner prior to the date of this Agreement), and Merrill Lynch and Co., whose
fees and expenses will be paid by Partner in accordance with Partner\'s
agreement with such firm (a copy of which has been delivered by Partner to
Company prior to the date of this Agreement). Each of Partner and Company
agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all
claims, liabilities or obligations with respect to any such fees, commissions
or expenses asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement
alleged to have been made by such party or any of its Affiliates.  SECTION
6.13 Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Partner
agrees that it will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Company
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that Company would have been permitted under the DGCL and its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Indemnified Party (and Partner and the Surviving Corporation
shall also advance any expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law; provided the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification).   (b) For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Partner shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to
the extent available in the market) in effect a directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy covering those persons who are covered as of the
date hereof by Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Partner) with
coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as Company\'s existing
coverage; provided, that in no event shall Partner or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by Company for such coverage (currently
approximately $172,500) (the "Current Premium"); and if such premium would at
any time exceed 200% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as can be so maintained or
obtained at an annual premium equal to 200% of the Current Premium.   (c)
The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be an addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of
Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.  SECTION 6.14 Benefit Matters.  
(a) If Partner requests in writing, Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, before the Effective Time, any
employee benefit plan that is a 401(k) plan. Partner shall provide the
opportunity for participants in Company\'s 401(k) Plan who are employed by
Partner or Company on the date that is 60 days after the Closing Date to
"roll over" their account balances into Partner\'s 401(k) plan.   36 
43   (b) At the Effective Time or following a reasonable transition period
as set forth below, continuing employees of Company ("Continuing Employees")
shall be eligible to participate in those Partner Employee Plans maintained
for similarly situated employees of Partner (or in substantially similar
programs), on the same terms applicable to similarly situated employees of
Partner and to the extent that such plans and programs provide the following
benefits: medical/dental/vision care, life insurance, disability income, sick
pay, holiday and vacation pay, 401(k) plan coverage, Internal Revenue Code
Section 125 benefit arrangements, bonus, profit-sharing or other incentive
plans, pension or retirement programs, dependent care assistance, severance
benefits, and employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Each Continuing
Employee shall be given credit for any vacation and sick leave time accrued,
but unused, as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time (or, if
later, the time of the transition of such employee from a Company Employee
Plan to a Partner Employee Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of
causing the Continuing Employees to participate in Partner Employee Plans as
of the Effective Time, Partner may, in its sole discretion, as to any one or
more of such benefits, cause the Continuing Employees to continue to
participate in a Company Employee Plan providing the relevant benefit
described in the first sentence of this paragraph for a reasonable transition
period after the Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee shall be given
credit, for purposes of any service requirements for participation or vesting
(but not benefit accrual for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan),
for his or her period of service with Company credited under a similar plan
prior to the Closing Date, subject to appropriate break in service rules.
Each such employee shall, with respect to any Partner plans or programs which
have co-payment, deductible or other co-insurance features, receive credit
for any amounts such individual has paid to date in the plan year of the
Effective Time (or, if later, the time of the transition of such employee
from a Company Employee Plan to a Partner Employee Plan) under comparable
plans or programs maintained by Company prior to the Effective Time. Each
Continuing Employee and eligible dependent who, at the Effective Time (or, if
later, the time of the transition of such employee from a Company Employee
Plan to a Partner Employee Plan), was participating in an employee group
health plan maintained by Company shall not be excluded from Partner\'s
employee group health plan or limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any
waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation to the extent
such restriction or limitation did not apply to such Continuing Employee as
of the Effective Time (of, if later, the time of transition of such
employee from a Company Employee Plan to a Partner Employee Plan) under
Company\'s group health plan.   (c) Partner shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) make all payments to be paid after the Effective
Time pursuant to the provisions contained in the Retention Policy applicable
to all eligible employees of Company. Without limiting Section 6.11, Partner
shall recognize all vesting, acceleration and other provisions under all
written agreements containing change in control type provisions applicable to
Company\'s officers, employees or directors in existence today and that have
been made available to Partner and that are listed on Section 6.14(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and Partner shall promptly make or cause to be
made all payments to such individuals required thereunder.   (d)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, but only to
the extent permissible under Section 6.16, Company may facilitate
the elimination of loss of deductions and excise taxes under Sections 280G
and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to severance payments and
other benefits to be provided to the persons who are party to the agreements
described in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule by advancing
to such persons, upon request, an amount equal to the amount such persons are
required to pay to Company to satisfy Company\'s withholding tax obligation
arising from such persons\' exercise of non-statutory stock options during
2000 in order to increase the amount of their respective "Total 280G Base"
calculations shown in Section 3.13(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any
amount so advanced shall be evidenced by a full recourse promissory note in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Company and Partner, shall bear interest at
the rate of 8% per annum and shall be payable in full no later than five days
following the Closing Date. The amount of any such advance, together with
accrued interest, may be setoff against, and deducted from, the amount of any
payments made to the persons receiving such advance pursuant to the
agreements identified in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
No advance to any person pursuant to this Section 6.14(d) shall exceed the
amount payable to such person pursuant to the applicable agreements
identified in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   37 
44   (e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company shall cause (i) the aggregate amount of annual bonuses that
are paid or payable to all employees of Company and its Subsidiaries for
calendar year 2000 to not exceed $1.8 million and to be allocated among
employees in a proportion that is not materially different from prior
practice, (ii) the aggregate amount of retention and severance benefits to be
paid or payable to all employees of Company and its Subsidiaries under the
Retention Policy to not exceed $2.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively,
assuming all employees qualify for such payments, and (iii) the aggregate
amount of cash severance payments to be paid or payable to all employees of
Company and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of any severance payments
attributable to the accelerated vesting of options or restricted stock or
performance share awards) pursuant to the agreements described on Section
3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to not exceed $7.0 million.
Company represents and warrants to Partner that, except for the amounts
contemplated in (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence, there are no
cash amounts which will be payable by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the termination of any employment or consulting agreement
to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or in connection with
the termination of the employment or consulting relationship under any
such agreement.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Sections 3.06, 3.08, and 5.01, until the Closing, Company may approve and
assign overriding royalty interests to its geoscientists pursuant to
Company\'s existing Onshore Geoscientist Overriding Royalty Interest Plan
("Onshore ORI Plan") and Gulf Coast Geoscientist Overriding Royalty Interest
Plan ("Offshore ORI Plan"). As more particularly described in Section 5.01(k)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Company may expose up to $10 million in
potential high bids at the Central Gulf of Mexico Sale #178 ("Sale #178"),
which is currently scheduled to be held in March 2001. The Offshore ORI Plan
shall apply to all leases acquired by Company or Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, at Sale #178 regardless of whether the sale is held prior to
or after the Effective Time, provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in the Offshore ORI Plan, Surviving
Corporation shall not bear an overriding royalty interest created by virtue
of the Offshore ORI Plan that is greater than 2.5%, proportionately reduced
to Surviving Corporation\'s working interest in the leases acquired pursuant
to Sale #178. Company or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
convey the appropriate overriding royalty interests to those geoscientists
who qualify for such awards under the Offshore ORI Plan by virtue of their
continuing employment with Company or Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, at the time of Sale #178 and who otherwise qualify for such awards under
the terms of the Offshore ORI Plan, it being understood that should any
of those geoscientists not be employed by Company or Surviving
Corporation, whichever is appropriate, as of the date of Sale #178, those
that are not so employed shall not be entitled to receive an overriding
royalty interest in the leases acquired pursuant to Sale #178. It is further
agreed that until Sale #178 is concluded, only Company\'s Vice President of
Gulf Coast Exploration shall have the right to terminate the employment of
any of Company\'s Gulf Coast geoscientists for performance-based reasons,
provided that he has received the prior concurrence of the CEO of Partner. If
the Closing occurs prior to Sale #178, Surviving Corporation shall prepare
and submit bids at Sale #178 in accordance with Company\'s past practices, up
to a total exposure of $10 million, under the continuing supervision of
Company\'s Vice President of Gulf Coast Exploration and Vice President of
Gulf Coast Operations, in consultation with the CEO of Partner. Company shall
offer to both of its Gulf Coast Vice Presidents prior to the Effective Time
an amendment to their respective employment agreements or change-of-control
employment agreements that extends until the later of the time currently
provided in such agreement or seven days after the conclusion of Sale #178
the period in which such officer may elect to terminate his employment and
continue to qualify to receive compensation to which he is entitled by reason
of the occurrence of a Change of Control of Company as defined in his
respective agreement.  SECTION 6.15 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy

Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"), shall not at the time the

Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or the

any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to Company or any of
its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Company which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement, Company shall promptly inform
Partner. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to
Partner or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered
