" _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Article_ __ _ I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of (x) a certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ") or (y) non-
certificated shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been
declared by the Company in accordance with this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time, and any dividends and other distributions in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.2_.

 

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that (i)
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company
or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cash dividends
and grants of equity compensation not prohibited by the terms hereof shall not
result in any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company or any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(d)_ shall not apply to
shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside from
shares held in the Companys treasury pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (as
such term is defined in _Section_ __ _ 3.15_).

 



3

    

(e) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Stock Options and Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Companys equity and equity based incentive plans)
shall adopt such resolutions as may be required and take all corporate action
necessary to effect the following:

(a) at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any
Company Benefit Plan, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and shall thereafter constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
any provisions for acceleration, the number (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock, determined by _multiplying_
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Merger
Consideration. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to
any such Company Stock Option at and after the Effective Time shall be an
amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Merger
Consideration;

 

(b) at the Effective Time, each cash-settled restricted stock unit award
(each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that corresponds to shares of Company
Common Stock granted under any Company Benefit Plan, outstanding as of the
Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a Company RSU
Award with respect to Company Common Stock and shall thereafter constitute a
cash-settled restricted stock unit award, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including any provisions for acceleration, with respect
to the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt,
any amounts relating to dividend equivalent rights, if any, granted with
respect to such Company RSU Award that are accrued but unpaid as of the
Effective Time will carry over and will be paid if required by and in
accordance with the terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

(c) at the Effective Time, each share of restricted Company Common Stock
subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction solely based on
continued service (each, a " _Company RS Award_ ") granted under any Company
Benefit Plan, outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall cease to represent a Company RS Award with respect to Company Common
Stock and shall thereafter constitute a restricted stock award, on the same

 



4

    

 terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company RS Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any provisions for
acceleration, with respect to the number (rounded to the nearest whole
number) of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RS Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Merger Consideration. For
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts relating to dividend equivalent rights, if
any, granted with respect to such Company RS Award that are accrued but
unvested and unpaid as of the Effective Time will carry over and will be
paid if required by and in accordance with the terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Company RS Award immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

(d) at the Effective Time, each award of notional shares of restricted
Company Common Stock whose vesting is conditioned in full or in part based on
achievement of performance goals or metrics (each, a " _Company PS Award_ ")
granted under any Company Benefit Plan, outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a Company PS Award with
respect to Company Common Stock and shall thereafter constitute an award, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company PS Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any performance-based
vesting conditions), including any provisions for acceleration, with respect
to the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company PS Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such
Company PS Award for any performance period that has not been completed as
of the Effective Time are achieved at the greater of "target" performance or
actual performance as of the Effective Time) by (y) the Merger Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts relating to dividend equivalent
rights, if any, granted with respect to such Company PS Award that are
accrued but unvested and unpaid as of the Effective Time will carry over and
will be paid if required by and in accordance with the terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Company PS Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and

(e) make such other changes to the Companys equity and equity based
incentive plans as the Company and Parent may agree in writing are appropriate
to give effect to the Merger.

With respect to any amount payable under this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause the
imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment
shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this Agreement and
the terms of the corresponding award that will not result in the imposition of
such Tax or penalty.

 

(f) (i) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to assume, as of
the Effective Time, the Companys obligations under the Company Stock
Options, Company RSU Awards, Company RS Awards and Company PS Awards and
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. (ii)
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than
five days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a registration statement on an
appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent
Common 

 



5

    

 Stock subject to options and other equity-based awards described in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such
options or other equity-based awards remain outstanding.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank, trust company
or nationally recognized stockholder services provider or such other Person
reasonably acceptable to the Company as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing shares of Company Common Stock. Parent will make available to
the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a
letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as
the Company and Parent may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of
shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange of any Book-
Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (i) one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested or required by applicable law)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and (ii) a check in the amount equal to any cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and in respect of any dividends and other
distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(f)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such
registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that

 



6

    

 such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Delivery of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, as applicable, with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a
limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other
entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision or
any agency or instrumentality thereof.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, or transferred as otherwise directed by Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 2.1_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery
of the Merger Consideration (and any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2_ and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_) in respect of such holders
shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares for any Merger Consideration (and any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and any dividends and distributions which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_) delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any Merger
Consideration (and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and any
dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_) remaining unclaimed by holders of shares
of Company Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any governmental body, agency, authority or entity)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Section_ __ _
2.1_. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor
(i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions
payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



7

    

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash delivered by Parent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no losses on
such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ II_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid promptly to Parent.

 

(h) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred by a
holder of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and the filing
of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes
and fees, shall be the responsibility solely of such holder.

 

Section 2.2 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.1_, a cash payment (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in
lieu of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock representing such
holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_ over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ (such excess being herein called the "
_Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices
on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in the
following paragraph.

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock would otherwise be entitled.

 



8

    

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

Section 2.3 _Lost_ _Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will, if such holder has otherwise
delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this  _Article_ __ _ II_.

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Company, Merger Subsidiary and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to _Articles_ _I_ and _II_ such amounts as it is required
to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law (and to the extent
deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding may be
taken in Parent Common Stock). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the Company, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable
governmental body, agency, authority or entity, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, and, if withholding is taken in
Parent Common Stock, the relevant withholding party shall be treated as having
sold such Parent Common Stock on behalf of such holder of the Company Common
Stock for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing
Authority.

 ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as disclosed (i) in
the Company SEC Documents or the MLP SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined)
filed or furnished prior to the date hereof (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein but
excluding any disclosures in such Company SEC Documents or MLP SEC Documents
in any risk factors section, in any section related to forward looking
statements and other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or (ii) in the correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure
schedules delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of a cross-reference to such
other section or subsection):

Section 3.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities or the
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " means any state of facts, change, development,
event, effect, condition or occurrence (each, an " _Effect_ ") that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or
continuing results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the
following Effects, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, or be
taken into account, in determining whether there has been, or would be,
a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any changes in general U.S., Israel,
Egypt, Jordan, Equatorial Guinea or global economic conditions or securities,
credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, (B) any changes or
conditions affecting the oil and gas industry in general (including changes
to commodity prices, general market prices and regulatory changes affecting
the industry), (C) any weather-related or other _force majeure_ event
(including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides,
wild fires or other natural disasters), (D) pandemics, epidemics, acts of war
(whether or not declared), armed hostility (by recognized governmental forces
or otherwise), sabotage, terrorism or cyber-attack, and any escalation or
general worsening of any of the foregoing, (E) Effects resulting from the
negotiation, execution, announcement, pendency, compliance with or performance
of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the terms hereof
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
impact thereof on the relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
customers, suppliers, partners, employees or governmental bodies,
agencies, officials or authorities; _provided_ that this _clause (E)_ shall
not apply to any representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_
or _Section_ __ _ 3.15(g)_ (or any condition to any partys obligation to
consummate the Merger relating to such representation and warranty) to the
extent the purpose of such representation and warranty is to address the
consequences resulting from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger, (F) any action taken or failure to take action
which Parent has requested in writing, (G) changes in applicable law,
regulation or government policy or in GAAP or in accounting standards, or any
changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any
changes in general legal, regulatory or political conditions, (H) any decline
in the market price, or change in trading volume, of the Companys capital
stock, (I) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts,
guidance, estimates, milestones, or budgets or internal or published financial
or operating predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position or
(J) any downgrade in the Companys credit rating (it being understood that
the exceptions in _clauses (H)_ , ( _I_ ) and _(J)_ shall not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any such change,
decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any
of the exceptions provided hereof) is a Company Material Adverse Effect);
_provided_ that, in the case of _clauses (A)_ _,_ _(B)_ , _(C)_ and _(D)_
, solely to the

 



10

    

 extent the impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is
disproportionately adverse compared to the impact on other oil and gas
companies that conduct business in the countries and regions in the world
impacted by the Effect in question, the incrementally disproportionate impact
or impacts shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been,
or would reasonably be expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of
this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), and the By-Laws of
the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (subject to the
amendment contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(v)_) (as so amended, the "
_Company By-Laws_").

 

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for
any required approval by the Companys stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ ") in connection with the consummation of the Merger,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. The affirmative
vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement is the only vote of the
holders of any of the Companys capital stock or the capital stock of any of
its Subsidiaries necessary in connection with consummation of the Merger.
Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors_
__ _Rights_ ").

 

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and
held on or prior to the date hereof, has (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are fair to
and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger),
(iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of
the holders of Company Common Stock and (iv) resolved (subject to _Section_ __
_ 5.2_) to recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
Company Common Stock.

 

Section 3.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency, official or
authority other than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger in accordance
with the DGCL, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"), (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of laws, rules and
regulations in foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control
matters, (d) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), (e) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_ "), (f) the
appropriate filings and approvals under the rules of the NYSE or Nasdaq Global
Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ "), (g) (if

 



11

    

 any) filings required to be made with the Federal Communications Commission
(the " _FCC_ ") and (h) other actions or filings the absence or omission of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.4 _Non-Contravention_ The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not, assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in  _Sections_ __ _ 3.2_ and _3.3_ , (a) contravene
or conflict with the Company Charter or the Company By-Laws or the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (b) contravene or
conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law,
regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or the passage of time would become a default)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any right or obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to a
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of, any agreement, contract or other instrument
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise,
permit or other similar authorization held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
contraventions, conflicts or violations referred to in  _clause_ __ _ (b)_

Section 3.6 _Subsidiaries_. 

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has
all powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with respect to any
Person, means any other Person, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of
which (i) more than fifty percent of the voting securities or other ownership
interests is owned by such Person or one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
such Person or one or more of its Subsidiaries is a general partner or holds

with respect to such corporation or other organization, are directly owned or
controlled by such Person or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt, for all purposes of this Agreement, the MLP and its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be Subsidiaries of the Company. The MLP
consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution,
Conveyance, Assumption and Simplification Agreement, dated as of November 14,

accordance with the terms thereof as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
and the MLP SEC Documents. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary,

 



13

    

 except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All "significant subsidiaries" (as such term is
defined in Section 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) of the
Company (collectively, and including for the avoidance of doubt, the MLP, "
_Significant Subsidiaries_ ") and all other entities listed on Exhibit 21 to
the Company 10-K and their respective jurisdictions of organization are
identified in  _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

(b) Except for directors qualifying shares, all of the outstanding
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each Significant Subsidiary
of the Company (other than the MLP and its Subsidiaries) is wholly-owned by
the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material Lien and
free of any other material limitation or restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i) securities
of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or (ii)
(A) options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries any capital stock, voting securities or other
ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
any capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests in, any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company, (B) bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of any Significant Subsidiary of the Company that are linked to,
or the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from, the value of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any dividends or
other distributions declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or which have or which by their terms may have at any time (whether actual or
contingent) the right to vote (or which are convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may vote or (C)
preemptive or similar rights, subscription or other rights, convertible
securities, or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the capital stock of any Significant Subsidiary of the Company,

transfer or sell any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership
interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any

Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, subscription or other right, convertible security,
agreement, arrangement or commitment (the items in the foregoing _subclauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ being referred to collectively as " _Company
Subsidiary Securities_ "). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any outstanding Company Subsidiary Securities. Other than the MLP, no
Subsidiary of the Company is, or since January 1, 2017 has been, subject to
any requirement to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. No Subsidiary
of the Company owns any shares of Company Common Stock.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY

 

Parent and Merger Subsidiary represent and warrant to the Company that, except
as disclosed (i) in the Parent SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined) filed
or furnished prior to the date hereof (including all exhibits and schedules
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein but excluding any
disclosures in such Parent SEC Documents in any risk factors section, in any
section related to forward looking statements and other disclosures that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) in the correspondingly
numbered section of the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent to the
Company simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedules_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding
the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or subsection):

 

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate
powers and all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Parent is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its
activities or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any Effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets or
continuing results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the following
Effects, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account, in determining whether there has been, or would be, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: (A) any changes in general U.S. or global economic conditions
or securities, credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, (B) any
changes or conditions affecting the oil and gas industry in general (including
changes to commodity prices, general market prices and regulatory changes
affecting the industry), (C) any weather-related or other _force majeure_
 event (including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods,
mudslides, wild fires or other natural disasters), (D) pandemics, epidemics,
acts of war (whether or not declared), armed hostility (by recognized
governmental forces or otherwise), sabotage, terrorism or cyber-attack, and
any escalation or general worsening of any of

 



32

    

 the foregoing, (E) Effects resulting from the negotiation, execution,
announcement, pendency, compliance with or performance of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the terms hereof or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the impact thereof on the
relationships of Parent and its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers,
partners, employees or governmental bodies, agencies, officials
or authorities; _provided_ that this _clause (E)_ shall not apply to any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ (or any condition
to any partys obligation to consummate the Merger relating to such
representation and warranty) to the extent the purpose of such representation
and warranty is to address the consequences resulting from the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (F) any action
taken or failure to take action which the Company has requested in writing,
(G) changes in applicable law, regulation or governmental policy or in GAAP or
in accounting standards, or any changes in the interpretation or enforcement
of any of the foregoing, or any changes in general legal, regulatory or
political conditions, (H) any decline in the market price, or change in
trading volume, of Parents capital stock or (I) any failure to meet any
internal or public projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, milestones,
or budgets or internal or published financial or operating predictions of
revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it being understood that the
exceptions in _clauses (H)_ and _(I)_  shall not prevent or otherwise affect
a determination that the underlying cause of any such change, decline or
failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any of the
exceptions provided hereof) is a Parent Material Adverse Effect);  _provided_
that, in the case of _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ and _(D)_ , solely to the
extent the impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is
disproportionately adverse compared to the impact on other oil and gas
companies that conduct business in the countries and regions in the world in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business, the incrementally
disproportionate impact or impacts shall be taken into account in determining
whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Merger Subsidiary is a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Merger. Since the date of its incorporation and prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities other than the execution
of this Agreement, the performance of its respective obligations hereunder,
and matters ancillary thereto, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has heretofore delivered
to the Company true and complete copies of Parents and Merger Subsidiarys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws as currently in effect.

 

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary
of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the corporate powers of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable against such party in
accordance with its terms, subject to Creditors Rights. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger, when issued in accordance
with the terms hereof, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights.

 



33

    

(b) The Board of Directors of Parent, at a meeting duly called and held on
or prior to the date hereof, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and
Parents stockholders and (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the Transactions.

this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of,
Merger Subsidiarys sole stockholder, (ii) approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Transactions and (iii) submitted this Agreement to
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, for adoption thereby and
recommended that Parent approve and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

Section 4.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental
body, agency, official or authority other than (a) the filing of a

applicable requirements of the Securities Act, (f) the appropriate filings
and approvals under the rules of the NYSE or Nasdaq, (g) (if any) filings
required to be made with the FCC and (h) other actions or filings the absence
or omission of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not, assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Sections_ __ _ 4.2_ and _4.3_ , (a) contravene or conflict with the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (b)
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or the passage of time would become a default)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any right or obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to a loss
of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under
any provision of, any agreement, contract or other instrument binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit or other
similar authorization held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such contraventions, conflicts or violations referred
to in  _clause_ __ _ (b)_ or defaults, rights of termination, cancellation
or acceleration, losses or Liens referred to in _clause_ __ _ (c)_ or _(d)_
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The approval of the stockholders of
Parent is not required by applicable law or the rules of the NYSE to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To Parents knowledge as of
the date of this Agreement, there is no Effect that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially interfere with the
consummation by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of the Merger and the
Transactions.

Section 5.2 _Company Stockholder Meeting_ _; Proxy Material_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ below, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the

neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall

44

    

 or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval of this Agreement,

5.2(f)_ below) (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in the Company
Recommendation_ "), or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to

(i) The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, in response
to a Superior Proposal received after the date of this Agreement and not
resulting from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.8_,
to not make the Company Recommendation, or to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation, or to cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_, in each case,
only if and to the extent that all of the following conditions are met: (A)
the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained; (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel, that making the Company Recommendation or failing to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law; (C) before
taking any such action, the Company promptly gives Parent written notice
advising Parent of the decision of the Board of Directors of the Company to
take such action (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), including the reasons
therefor and specifying the material terms and conditions of the applicable
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and the Company will also promptly give Parent such a notice with
respect to any subsequent change in such proposal) and the Company has given
Parent at least four (4) Business Days (as modified, extended or continued
by this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , the " _Superior Proposal Match
Period_ ") after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement (or to make another proposal) in response to such Acquisition
Proposal and during such period has made its representatives reasonably
available to negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification (other than
immaterial amendments or modifications) of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new notice period with a new Superior Proposal Match Period of three
(3) Business Days); and (D) the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
(as defined in _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_) at the end of such Superior Proposal
Match Period after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of,
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, as well as any revisions to the terms of the Merger or this Agreement
proposed by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted
by the Company after being notified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)(_
_i_ _)_.

 

(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted, in response
to an Intervening Event occurring after the date of this Agreement, to not
make the Company Recommendation or to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent the Company Recommendation, only if and to the extent that all of
the following conditions are met: (A) the Company Stockholder Approval has
not been obtained; (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, as a result of the Intervening Event, after consulting with
outside legal counsel, that making the Company Recommendation or failing to
so withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors

 



45

    

 exercise of their fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law; (C)
before taking any such action, the Company promptly gives Parent written
notice advising Parent of the decision of the Board of Directors of the
Company to take such action (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ "), which notice
will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and the Company has
given Parent at least five (5) Business Days (as modified, extended or
continued by this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)(ii)_, the " _Intervening Event Match
Period_ ") after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement (or to make another proposal) in response to such Intervening
Event and during such period has made its representatives reasonably available
to negotiate with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any (it being
understood and agreed that any change in fact (other than an immaterial
change) relating to such Intervening Event shall require a new notice period
with a new Intervening Event Match Period of three (3) Business Days); and
(D) Parent does not make, within the Intervening Event Match Period, a
proposal in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, would
obviate the need to not make or withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means any event,
development or change in circumstances that was not known to the Companys
Board of Directors, or if known, the consequences of which were not reasonably
foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement, which event, change or
development becomes known to the Companys Board of Directors prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; _ provided_ that in no event
shall the following events, changes or developments constitute an Intervening
Event: (x) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (y) any change in the price
or trading volume of the Company Common Stock, the Parent Common Stock or any
other securities of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the underlying causes of such changes may
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been,
an Intervening Event).

(iii) Notwithstanding (i) any Change in the Company Recommendation, or
(ii) the making of any Acquisition Proposal, until termination of this
Agreement (A) in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (1)
enter into, or approve or recommend, or, except as set forth in Section
5.2(b), propose to approve or recommend, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, option agreement, acquisition agreement or other
agreement constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement as and to the extent permitted to be entered into
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.8_), (2) except as required by applicable
law or _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, make, facilitate or provide information in
connection with any SEC or other regulatory filings in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or (3) seek any third-
party consents in connection with any transactions contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to
the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , however, for the avoidance of doubt,
without limiting the Companys right to terminate this Agreement in the
circumstances set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall not limit the Companys obligation to submit this
Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



46

Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with

event with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect
to information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the

respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the
Company Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be
described in an amendment of or a supplement to the Form S-4 or the Company
Proxy Statement, such event shall be so described, and such amendment or
supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(e) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly notify the other
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
applicable government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or
any other applicable government official for amendments or supplements to any

transactions contemplated hereby or for additional information and (ii)
promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its representatives, or Parent or any of its
representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff
or any other applicable government official, on the other hand, with respect
thereto. The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Form S-4 and the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and provide to each other
all information necessary in order to prepare the Form S-4 and the Company

consultation with Parent, set a record date for the Company Stockholder

Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend to the Companys stockholders the adoption of this Agreement (the "
_Company Recommendation_ ") and shall include such recommendation in the
Company Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors
of the Company may fail to make such Company Recommendation or make a Change
in the Company Recommendation if permitted by, and in accordance with,

 



47

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ and the Companys rights to terminate
this Agreement under the circumstances set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the
Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first two sentences of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(f)_ or its other obligations under this  _Section_
__ _ 5.2_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or its stockholders or
representatives of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon

in the Company Recommendation permitted by, and in accordance with, _Section_
__ _ 5.2(b)_) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn, postpone or
otherwise delay the Company Stockholder Meeting;  _provided_ that the Company
may, notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) if, after
consultation with Parent, the Company believes in good faith that such
adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable
additional time to (1) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, or (2) distribute any supplement or amendment to
the Company Proxy Statement the distribution of which the Board of Directors
of the Company has determined in good faith to be necessary under applicable
law after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, outside
legal counsel or (B) for an absence of a quorum. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent

and no such postponement or adjournment pursuant to _clause (A)(1)_ or _(B)_
of the immediately preceding sentence shall be, without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), for a period exceeding ten (10) Business Days and in no event may
the Company postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting without the written
consent of Parent if doing so would require the setting of a new record date.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the matters contemplated by the
Company Stockholder Approval shall be the only matters (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by the
Companys stockholders in connection therewith) that the Company shall propose
to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. The Company shall otherwise coordinate and cooperate with Parent with

required by applicable law, or as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ of the

distribution payable in cash, stock or property with respect to Parents

dividend; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not declare, set aside or
pay any dividend except in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.11_;

 

(d) acquire (or agree to acquire) any assets, property or securities if,
individually or in the aggregate, such acquisition or acquisitions would

49

    

 Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, other than the MLP and its
Subsidiaries, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or
of such Subsidiary, as applicable, or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or of
such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee
benefit plan, trust or other enterprise (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses
(including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities
or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim (including a claim of a
violation of applicable law), action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding,
investigation or other proceeding at law or in equity or order or ruling, in
each case whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise
and whether or not such claim, action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding,
investigation or other proceeding or order or ruling results in a formal civil
or criminal litigation or regulatory action (" _Proceeding_ ") to which such
Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or of such Subsidiary, a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or of such Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary to
pay expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such
Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law). Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, upon learning of
any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure
so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such partys position with respect to such claims).
Parent will have the right, upon written notice to any applicable Indemnified
Person, to assume the defense of any Proceeding in respect of which
indemnification is or would be sought hereunder employing counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, an Indemnified Person shall only be
entitled to the rights provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ after providing a
written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
such amounts if it is ultimately determined under applicable law that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any provision in the organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries other than the MLP and its
Subsidiaries (and Parent shall not authorize or consent to any such amendment,
repeal or other modification of the organizational documents of the MLP or
any of its Subsidiaries) in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder or under the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification,
exculpation or expense advancement, except to the extent

 



50

    

 required by applicable law. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries other than the MLP and its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor
any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between
the Company or any of such Subsidiaries and any of its or their directors,
officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (other than the
MLP and its Subsidiaries) to indemnify any Indemnified Person against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified
Persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_; _provided_ , that, any such
Indemnified Person shall only be entitled to the rights provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ after providing a written undertaking by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined under applicable law that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to be indemnified.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to put in place,
and Parent shall fully prepay no later than immediately prior to the Closing,
"tail" insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time placed with insurance companies
having the same or better AM Best Financial rating as the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance companies with terms and
conditions providing retentions, limits and other material terms no less
favorable than the current directors and officers liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company with respect to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may elect in its sole discretion, but shall not be
required, to spend more than the amount set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Cap Amount_ ") for the six (6) years
of coverage under such "tail" policy; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Parent elects not to spend
more than the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Parent shall purchase as much
coverage as is reasonably available for the Cap Amount.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise
dispose of any of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the parties and any and all Persons entitled
to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, and their heirs and representatives.

 

Section 6.4 _Form_ __ _ S_ _-4_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC under the
Securities Act the Form S-4, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Form S-4 to be declared effective by the SEC a sufficient time prior
to the Company Stockholder Meeting to allow the Company to mail the Company
Proxy Statement to the Company stockholders, as required by the rules and
regulations of the SEC, prior

 



51

    

 to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall take any action required to
be taken under foreign or state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with
the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

Section 6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall take all necessary
action to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.

 

Section 6.6 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all benefits and
obligations, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ hereof, under the Company
Benefit Plans, each as in effect on the date hereof (or as amended to the
extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.1_), to the extent that entitlements or
rights, actual or contingent (whether such entitlements or rights are vested
as of the Effective Time or become vested or payable only upon the occurrence
of a further event) exist in respect thereof as of the Effective Time. Parent
and the Company hereby agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a " _Change in
Control_ " for purpose of any employee arrangement and all other Company
Benefit Plans, pursuant to the terms of such plans in effect on the date
hereof. No provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ shall be construed as a
limitation on the right of Parent to amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plans which the Company would otherwise have under the terms of such Company
Benefit Plan, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ shall be
construed to create a right in any employee or beneficiary of such employee
under a Company Benefit Plan that such employee or beneficiary would not
otherwise have under the terms of such plan.

 

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
continue to provide to individuals who are employed by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employed with Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent (" _Affected Employees_ "), for so long as such
Affected Employees remain employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent,
compensation and employee benefits (i) pursuant to the Companys or the
Company Subsidiaries compensation (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
equity incentive compensation; provided that Parent may provide cash-based
compensation in lieu of the grant date value of equity incentive compensation)
and employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements as provided to
such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) pursuant to
compensation and employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing coverage and
benefits, which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided
to employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by Affected
Employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time after the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms and conditions of employment
for any Affected Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, works council agreement, or other contract or agreement with any
labor union, works council or other employee representative organization shall
be governed by such contract or agreement and the foregoing provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ or the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_ shall be
inapplicable thereto.

 



52

    

(c) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit
accruals (other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension or
post-employment or retiree health or welfare plan that, in each case, is not a
Company Benefit Plan) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for such Affected Employees
service with the Company or any Subsidiary to the same extent recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent
that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for
the same period of service.

 

(d) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) for the year in which the Effective Time occurs, provide each
Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to a Change of Control (as defined in the Trust Agreement), the
Company shall adopt resolutions and take all such corporate action as is
necessary to amend the Noble Energy, Inc. Restoration Trust (the " _Trust_ ")
agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") to eliminate the Companys requirement
under Section 1(f) of the Trust Agreement to fund the Trust following any
such Change of Control, and such amendment shall be effective no later than
the day immediately prior to such Change of Control. The Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such Trust Agreement has been amended and the form
and substance of such documentation shall be subject to the reasonable
approval of Parent.

 

(f) If requested by the Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less
than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions and take all such corporate action as
is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan maintained, sponsored or
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Company 401(k) Plans_ "), in each case, effective as of the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that such Company 401(k) Plans have been properly terminated, the form of
such termination documents shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Parent. To the extent the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to
Parents request, the Affected Employees shall be eligible to participate in
a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and such Affected Employees
shall be entitled to effect a direct rollover of any eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code),
including any outstanding loans, to such 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or
its Subsidiaries.

 

(g) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Affected Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries will
assume and honor all unused vacation and other paid time off days accrued or
earned by such Affected Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



53

    

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, express or implied,
shall (i) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii)
limit the ability of Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, except as permitted by
the terms of such plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement,
(iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person
(including any employee) or any right to employment or services or continued
employment or service or to a particular term or condition of employment or
service with Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective affiliates or (iv) limit the right of Parent or the Company
(or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates) to terminate
the employment or service of any employee or other service provider following
the Closing at any time and for any or no reason.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall have reasonably cooperated with Parent to provide to Parent such
information reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to calculate the
impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in
combination with another event.

(j) Following the date of this Agreement, to the extent applicable, the
Company shall provide Parent with a list of employees who would be affected by
any facility closings or employee layoffs or reductions in force that would
trigger the notice requirements under the WARN Act and that would occur
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

Section 7.1 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections_ __ _ 5.2_, _7.1(b)_ and 7.1(c), the Company and
Parent shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including,
without limitation, preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
and (ii) obtain as soon as practicable all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any third party or governmental body, agency, authority or
official which are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and
the 

 



54

    

 other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall submit the notifications required under the HSR Act relating to the
Merger within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement and shall
prepare and file such other materials as may be required under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger in the jurisdictions set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules as promptly
as practicable. Prior to Closing, and subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall each keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required approvals or
consents of any governmental agency, body, authority or entity in connection
with the Merger. The Company and Parent shall have the right to review
in advance, and each will consult the other to provide any necessary
information with respect to all filings made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any governmental agency, body, authority
or entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall each promptly
inform the other party, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies
of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of)
any communication from any governmental agency, body, authority or entity
regarding the Merger, and provide the other party with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any governmental agency, body, authority or
entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, Parent shall have
the principal responsibility for determining and implementing the strategy
for obtaining any necessary antitrust clearance, consents or approvals
(including with respect to timing and potential ways to address any concerns
that may be raised) and shall lead and direct all submissions to, meetings,
negotiations and communications with any governmental agency, body, authority
or entity or other party in connection with antitrust matters with respect to
any Antitrust Law, and shall do so in a manner reasonably designed to obtain
any such clearance, consents or approvals prior to the End Date; but provided,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit in any respect any partys
obligations under this Agreement. If either party receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any governmental agency,
body, authority or entity with respect to the Merger, then such party will use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Subject to applicable laws or any request made by any applicable
governmental agency, body, authority or entity (including the staff thereof),
the Company and Parent shall each furnish to each other copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between it and any such
governmental agency, body, authority or entity with respect to this Agreement
and the Merger, and furnish the other party with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of filings or submissions of information to
any such governmental agency, body, authority or entity; _provided_ that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual obligations, and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns.

(b) Without limiting  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, Parent and the Company
shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, as applicable:

 

(i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the End Date (as defined in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ ), including without limitation defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any
Person; and

 



55

    

(ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that
may be asserted by any governmental agency, body, authority or entity with
respect to the Merger (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no
later than the End Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent
or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their
ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing. Parent and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or
Parent or Parents Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such action is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger. The Company agrees and acknowledges that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, in
connection with any filing or submission required, action to be taken or
commitment to be made by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries
shall, without Parents prior written consent, sell, divest, or dispose of any
assets, license of any Company Intellectual Property, commit to any sale,
divestiture or disposal of businesses, product lines or assets of the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries or any license of Company Intellectual Property
or take any other action or commit to take any action that would limit the
Companys, Parents or any of their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action
with respect to, or their ability to retain any of, their businesses, product
lines or assets or Company Intellectual Property;  _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not relieve any party of its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ nor any other provision of this Agreement shall
be construed to require Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries to undertake
(or to request or authorize the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries to undertake) any efforts or to take any action if such efforts
or action would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Substantial
Detriment. " _Substantial Detriment_ " shall mean changes or effects which
would, individually or in the aggregate (and after giving effect to any
reasonably expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets), result in,
or be reasonably likely to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, at or
after the Effective Time;  _provided_ that any requirement to divest or hold
separate, or limit the operation of, any division, Subsidiary, interest,
business, product line, asset or property relating to the operations conducted
by Parent and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
result in a Substantial Detriment if such action with respect to a comparable
amount of assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
together with all other actions taken pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_,
would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time.

 



56

    

Section 7.2 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any governmental body, agency, authority or official is required,
or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in
seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the
Company Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company
and Parent will, during normal business hours and upon reasonable request, (a)
give the other party and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties,
books and records of such party and its Subsidiaries, (b) furnish to the other
party and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request and (c) instruct its employees, counsel
and financial advisors to reasonably cooperate with the other party in its
investigation of the business of the Company or Parent, as the case may be; 
_provided_ that such investigation shall not disrupt the Companys or Parents
operations; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no such investigation shall
affect any representation or warranty given by either party
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, on the one
hand, nor Parent, on the other hand, shall be required to provide any
information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to the other by
reason of any applicable law, which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by
reason of contract or agreement with any third Person. Each party shall use
reasonable efforts to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. All information obtained by Parent or the Company pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with, and
shall otherwise be subject to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement
dated as of June 20, 2020 between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, from the date
of the Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, subject to the
terms and limitations of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, cooperate in good faith to
provide Parent as promptly as practicable with the information described in
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

Section 7.4 _Tax_ _ Treatment_.

(a) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their
Subsidiaries to, take any action, or cause any action to be taken, which
action would prevent or impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Reorganization Treatment_ ") _;_ and,
Parent and the Company intend to report the Merger for U.S federal income tax
purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code; _provided_ , that none of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of
either thereof shall have any liability or obligation to any holder of Company
Common Stock should the Merger fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



57

    

(b) Parent and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts and
reasonably cooperate with one another in connection with the issuance to
Parent or the Company of any opinion relating to the Reorganization Treatment

reasonably necessary or appropriate for such counsel to render such opinion.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will except with respect to any item
included in  _Section_ __ _ 3.27_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules or

with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public

not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any press
release or public statement as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued prior

its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party, and (b) a party
may, without such consultation, issue a press release or make a public
statement that is consistent with prior press releases issued or public
statements made in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or any

Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by
any provision in this Agreement (other than as required by _Section_ __ _

does not relate specifically to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the Company will direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, take any action to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal (including without
limitation by amending, or granting any waiver under, Article TWELFTH of the
Company Charter or Section 203 of the DGCL) or any inquiry with
respect thereto or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect thereto (except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_), or disclose any nonpublic
information or afford access to properties, books or records to any Person
that has made, or to the Companys knowledge is considering making, any
Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) making any disclosure if, in the case of this _clause (ii)_ , in the
good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors, after consultation
with outside counsel, the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure that relates to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation unless the
Companys Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but
subject to the first sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_, prior to (but not
after) the date of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, directly
or indirectly through its advisors, agents or other intermediaries, (A)
furnish information and access, but only in response to a request for

hereof which was not obtained as a result of a breach of  _Section_ __ _
5.2_ or this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ and (B) participate in discussions and
negotiate with such Person or its representatives concerning any such
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, in any such case set forth
in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or _(B)_ of this sentence,

 



59

    

 (1) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after (x)
receipt of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and (y) taking into account any revisions to the terms of the Merger or this
Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law
and (2) (x) the Company receives from the Person making such an Acquisition
Proposal, prior to engaging in any of the activities described in _clause (A)_
or _(B)_ of this sentence, an executed confidentiality agreement the material
terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without regard to the
terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects (i) no less
favorable to the Company and (ii) no less restrictive to the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) any information provided to such Person has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ unless the Company shall have first
delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action. 

(b) In the event that on or after the date of this Agreement the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
by any Person that has made, or has informed the Company it is considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will (A) promptly (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof) notify (which
notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material terms
thereof) Parent thereof, (B) keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed of
the status and material terms of (including with respect to changes to the
status or material terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal or request and (C)
as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) provide to Parent unredacted copies of all material
correspondence and written materials (whether or not electronic) sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions thereof, including any proposed transaction agreements (along with
all schedules and exhibits thereto and any financing commitments related
thereto), as well as written summaries of any material oral communications
relating to the terms and conditions thereof. The Company (x) shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and
other representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the date
hereof with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or the
possibility thereof, (y) shall promptly request each Person, if any, that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the nine (9) months prior to the
date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal
to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (z) immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access for such Person and
their representatives to diligence or other information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall not modify, amend or terminate,
or waive, release or assign, any provisions of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party relating to

 any such Acquisition Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such
agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted on a confidential
basis, upon written request by a relevant party thereto and without prior
notice to Parent disclosing the party and the circumstances, to release or
waive any standstill obligations solely to the extent necessary to permit the
party referred therein to submit an Acquisition Proposal to the Board of
Directors of the Company on a confidential basis. The Company shall provide
written notice to Parent of waiver or release of any standstill by the
Company, including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto
and circumstances relating thereto.

or such other address, email or facsimile number as such party may hereafter
specify for the purpose by notice to the other parties hereto. Each such
notice, request or other communication shall be effective (a) if given by
facsimile or email, when such facsimile or email is transmitted to the
facsimile number or email specified in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and, in the
case of a facsimile, the appropriate facsimile confirmation is received and,
in the case of an email, (i) a duplicate copy of such email notice is promptly

or (ii) the receiving party delivers a written confirmation of receipt of
such notice by email or any other method described in this _Section_ __ _
10.1_ or (b) if given by any other means, when delivered at the
address specified in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_.

 

Section 10.2 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_.
The representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time
or any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.3 _Amendments; No Waivers_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto) may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_
that after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
no such amendment or waiver shall, without the further approval of such
stockholders, alter or change (i) the amount or kind of consideration to
be received in exchange for any shares of capital stock of the Company or
(ii) any term of the certificate of incorporation of Parent.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in  _Section_ __ _
10.5_ or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense, except that those expenses incurred in connection with printing,
mailing and filing the Registration Statement, all filing fees paid in respect
of the filings under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger, and all
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any cooperation provided or action taken pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.13_ or in connection with any financing to be obtained by Parent relating to
the repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company
shall in each case be borne by Parent.

Section 10.5 _Company_ ___Termination Fee_. If: 

(i) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)_;

 

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(ii)_, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and the Company
Stockholder Approval shall not theretofore have been obtained or (C) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ and the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not theretofore have been obtained, and
after the date hereof but on or before the date of any such termination an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made and become publicly known, whether
or not withdrawn, (x) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of
a termination contemplated by clause (ii)(A)) or (y) prior to the date of
such termination (in the case of a termination contemplated by clause (ii)(B)
or (ii)(C)); or

 

(iii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(f)_;

 

then in any case as described in _clause (_ _i_ _)_ , _(ii)_ or ( _iii_ ) the
Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds), (x) in the case described in _clause (_ _i_ _)_
or ( _iii)_ , $176,295,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") not later than the date
of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case described in _clause
(ii)_ , the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) an amount equal to the
Termination Fee not later than the date an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
or a definitive agreement is entered into by the Company providing for any
Acquisition Proposal, as long as such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
such definitive agreement is executed within twelve (12) months after the date
of termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for the
purpose of this _clause (y)_ , all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to 20% shall instead refer to 50%. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.5_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount payable to Parent
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount so payable at
the rate on six (6)-month United States Treasury obligations (as of the date
such payment was required to be made pursuant to this Agreement) plus three
percent (3%).

 

Section 10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto except that Merger
Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of its affiliates, its rights under this Agreement, but any such
transfer or assignment will not relieve Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder.

 



69

    

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without
regard to principles of conflicts of law.

 

Section 10.8 _Enforcement; Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate
remedy, and accordingly, each party agrees that the other party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in
equity. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may only be brought in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if such court declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, then in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is not then
available in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
(but only in such event), then in any court sitting of the State of Delaware
in New Castle County) and any appellate court from any of such courts (in any
case, the " _Delaware Court_ "), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any of the Delaware Courts.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party when deemed given pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1_; _provided_ that nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 10.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

Section 10.11 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto), constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except for the
provisions of (a) _ Articles_ __ _ II_ and _III_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the rights of the former holders of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration or the rights of the

 



70

    

 former holders of Company Stock Options, Company RSU Awards, Company RS
Awards and Company PS Awards to receive the amounts payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_), and (b) Section 5.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (which from and after the Effective Time
are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Persons
referred to therein and by their respective heirs and representatives), no
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies.

 

Section 10.12 _Captions_. The captions herein are included for convenience
of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.

Section 10.13 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.14 _Interpretation_. Unless the context otherwise requires,
words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa,
words denoting any gender shall include all genders, and words denoting
natural persons shall include corporations, limited liability companies and
partnerships and vice versa. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule, as applicable, of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The words "the date hereof", "the date of this Agreement" and
words of similar import mean the day and year first set forth above in the
preamble to this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
"neither," "nor," "any," "either" and "or" are not exclusive. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if." References to
"days" shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated otherwise. When used
in this Agreement, "Business Day" means any day other than (i) a Saturday or a
Sunday, (ii) a day on which commercial banks in New York City or the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware is authorized or required by law
to be closed or (iii) any day on which the SECs Electronic Data Gathering and
Retrieval system is not open to accept filings. References to "from" or
"through" any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or
through and including such date, respectively. Any reference in this Agreement
to a date or time shall be deemed to be such date or time in the City of New
York, New York, U.S.A., unless otherwise specified. Except with respect to any
disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules,
any contract referred to herein means such contract, instrument or law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. References to any statute
shall be deemed to refer to such statute and any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder. References to a 

 



71

    

 person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The words "provided
to", "delivered" or "made available" and words of similar import refer to
documents which were delivered in person or electronically to the other party
or its representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement or, prior to
the calendar day immediately preceding the date hereof, posted to the data
site maintained by the disclosing party or its representatives in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ that, in the case of
delivery via such data site, the other party had access to such documents in
such data site and such documents were not removed from such data site prior
to the execution hereof) and, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any
documents filed or furnished by the disclosing party or its Subsidiaries with
the SEC and publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering and
Retrieval system as an exhibit after December 31, 2017 and prior to the date
that was the calendar day prior to the execution of this Agreement. Each of
the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of
this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.
