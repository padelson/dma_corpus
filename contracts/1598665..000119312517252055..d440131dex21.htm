still in good faith objects to any contents of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet or Preliminary Closing Book Value Statement (any such
objections, the " _Pre-Closing Book Value Objections_"), it being understood
that such objection by Parent shall not delay or impair the Closing but shall
be taken into account solely for purposes of determining the Requisite Escrow

contribution payment to Parent of such Subscription Stockholders Subscription
Price Amount under the Subscription Agreement (with an amount equal to such

shares of common stock of Parent being further applied toward the Escrow

this _Section 3.05_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent
expressly waive any requirement for any submission or processing fee in
connection therewith.

Section 3.06 _Payments to Persons Other than Registered Holders_. If any
consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is

Entry Shares and (c) shall pay to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or

shall prepare and deliver to Stockholder Representative a statement (the "
_Transaction Expenses True-up Statement_") signed by an officer of the Company
certifying and setting forth (A) the aggregate amount of unpaid
Transaction Expenses not reflected on the Transaction Expense Statement
(delivered prior to the Closing) (the " _Expense True-up Amount_") and (B) an
itemized list of each unpaid Transaction Expense with a description of the
nature of such expense and the Person (and the bank account of such Person) to
whom such expense is owed.

 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative objects to the Transaction Expenses
True-up Statement, the Stockholder Representative will notify the Company in
writing on or before the date that is fifteen (15) days after the date on
which the Company delivers to the Stockholder Representative the Transaction
Expenses True-up Statement (the " _True-up Review Period_") of such objection
by setting forth the Stockholder Representatives calculation of the Expense
True-up Amount, including each component thereof, and describing in reasonable
detail the basis for such objection (the " _True-up Objection Notice_"). If
the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a True-up Objection Notice
prior to the expiration of the True-up Review Period, the Companys
calculation of the Expense True-up Amount shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.
If a True-up Objection Notice is delivered to the Company prior to the
expiration of the True-up Review Period, the Stockholder Representative and
the Company shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objection. If
the Stockholder Representative and the Company are able to resolve their
objection with respect to the calculation of the Expense True-up Amount, such
agreed calculation shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. If the
Stockholder Representative and the Company are unable to resolve all such
objections on or before the date that is five (5) days following notification
by the Stockholder Representative of any such objection, the Stockholder
Representative and the Company shall retain the Independent Accountant to
resolve all such objections, it being understood the Independent Accountant
shall adjudicate only those items still in dispute with respect to the
Expense True-up Amount and the calculation of the Expense True-up Amount. The
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be binding and conclusive
on the Stockholder Representative and the Company. The Expense True-up Amount
shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.07(c)_ below.

 

(b) _Closing Balance Sheet; Closing Book Value Statement_.

 

(i) _General_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, prepare and
deliver to the Stockholder Representative as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, but no later than February 28, 2018, (A) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2017 (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (B) a statement (the " _Closing Book Value
Statement_ ") setting forth a calculation of the Closing Book Value and the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Book Value is less than or greater than
the Estimated Book Value. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Book
Value Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Methods
and in the same form as the Reference Balance Sheet.

 

(ii) _Objection Notice_. If the Stockholder Representative objects, which
objection may only be made solely on the basis of the second sentence in
_Section 3.07(b)(iv)_, to the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Book Value
Statement, the Stockholder Representative will notify Parent in writing on or
before the date that is thirty (30) days after the date on which Parent
delivers to the Stockholder Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Book Value Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") of such objection by
setting forth the Stockholder Representatives calculation of the Closing
Book Value, including each component thereof, and describing in reasonable
detail the basis for such objection (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If the
Stockholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, Parents calculation of the Closing Book
Value shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be
subject to appeal or further review. If an Objection Notice is delivered to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objection. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are able to resolve
their objection with respect to the calculation of the Closing Book Value,
such agreed calculation shall be

 



20  conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to resolve all such objections on or before the date that is fifteen
(15) days following notification by the Stockholder Representative of any such
objection, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall retain the
Independent Accountant to resolve all such objections, it being understood
the Independent Accountant shall adjudicate only those items still in dispute
with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing
Book Value. The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be binding
and conclusive on the Company Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent.

(iii) _Resolution by Independent Accountant_. Within fifteen (15) days after
the date of referral of the disputed matters to the Independent Accountant,
the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall provide the Independent
Accountant with a true and correct copy of each of the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Book Value Statement, and the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall each prepare and deliver to the Independent Accountant a written
report of such line item or items remaining in dispute, which report shall
set forth the specific dollar amount proposed by such party for each such item
or items (which shall not be greater or less, as applicable, than the value
for such item claimed by the Parent in the Closing Balance Sheet or the
Closing Book Value Statement, as applicable, or the Stockholder
Representative in the Objection Notice) and a detailed explanation of the
basis and rationale for their respective positions. The Independent Accountant
shall deliver a written report resolving only the disputed matters and
setting forth the basis for such resolution within thirty (30) days after the
Stockholder Representative and Parent submit in writing (or have had the
opportunity to submit in writing but have not submitted) their positions as
to the disputed items. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant (A) may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either the Stockholder Representative
or Parent, or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either the
Stockholder Representative or Parent, in each case as presented to the
Independent Accountant, (B) shall be bound by the principles set forth in
this  _Section 3.07_, and (C) shall limit its review to matters specifically
set forth in the Objection Notice. The findings and determinations of the
Independent Accountant as set forth in its written report shall be deemed
final, conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Parent and the Company
Stockholders in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved
by the Independent Accountant, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accountant at
the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The Independent Accountant shall conduct its determination
activities in a manner wherein all materials submitted to it are held in
confidence and shall not be disclosed to third parties.

 

(iv) _Other Matters regarding Dispute Resolution_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any disputes regarding amounts
shown in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Book Value Statement shall
be resolved solely and exclusively as set forth in this _Section 3.07_. The
scope of the disputed items to be resolved by the Independent Accountant
shall be limited to whether the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Book
Value Statement were prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Methods or
mathematical error. The findings and determinations of the
Independent Accountant as set forth in its written report shall be deemed
final, conclusive and binding upon the parties and shall not be subject to
collateral attack for any reason. The parties shall be entitled to have a

Parent (and all adjustments made thereto due to any Parent Penalty or Company
Penalty) pursuant to this  _Section 3.07_ shall be made in cash and shares

event that the Company does not timely deliver a FIRPTA Certificate in
accordance with _Section 3.04(a)(iii)_ at least ten (10) days prior to any
such withholding), and will use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or
eliminate any applicable withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered
and paid to the Company or any other recipient of payment in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.09 _No Liability for Abandoned Property_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving

of such amounts. Each Company Stockholder who delivers a duly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and surrenders the related Stock Certificate,

Surviving Corporation for satisfaction of any claims related to the Class A
Merger Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration. Any interest, dividends
or other income earned on the investment of cash held by the Surviving
Corporation, together with all Tax and other liabilities associated
therewith, shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation.

Section  3.11 _Rights of Former Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, the
statutory books of the Company shall be closed as to holders of Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Common Stock by
any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.05_, each Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing a share of Common
Stock (other than any Excluded Share) shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable. The Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares).

records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, for any reasonable business purpose, including
in connection with any insurance claims by, third party Actions or Tax audits,
third party claims, third party litigation, or other third party proceedings
against, governmental investigations of, compliance with legal requirements
by, or the preparation of financial statements or Tax Returns of, any Company
Stockholder or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that, following the Closing, such Person shall execute a customary
confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent relating to the scope of information to be accessed, which shall
include a requirement that such Person is liable for breaches of its
Affiliates and representatives; _provided_ , _further_ , that if access to any
books and records or other information that is subject to (i) an attorney-
client or other legal privilege would give rise to a material risk of waiver
of such privilege or (ii) confidentiality or non-disclosure restrictions would
result in a material breach of such restrictions, such books and records and
other information shall not be made so accessible; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if Parent does not provide access or information in reliance on the
foregoing, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to the requesting Company Stockholder in a manner that
would not violate the applicable Law or Contract or waive such a privilege if
and to the extent possible. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the books
and records held by them relating to the respective businesses of the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from and after
the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law).

 

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, prior to the Closing, the
information provided to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be terminated upon the Closing.

Section 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Matters; Other_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.03(h)_), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority all

 



45  necessary filings, applications and submissions, (ii) obtaining all
necessary, proper or advisable consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or
permits of any Governmental Authorities and (iii) if requested by Parent,
each party hereto obtaining all consents or approvals of, or waivers from, any
third party under any Contract that is required to be obtained by such party
or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the failure to obtain any
consent, approval or waiver described in _Section 6.03(a)(iii)_ above shall
not constitute a failure to satisfy any condition set forth in  _Article
VII_ or otherwise relieve any Person from its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, Parent shall be solely responsible for the costs of making or
obtaining any consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or permits,
required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the transaction and
Parent shall be solely responsible for the costs of making or obtaining any
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or permits, required to be
obtained by Parent in connection with the transaction.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to _Section 6.03(h)_, Parent
and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to avoid each and every
impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by, or Governmental
Order that may be entered with, any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, including any of the following actions requested by any
Governmental Authority, or necessary or appropriate to (x) obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers of any Governmental Authority
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, (y) resolve any objections that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (z) prevent
the entry of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any
Governmental Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including any of the actions described in _clauses (i)_ through
_(ii)_ below that may be necessary, proper or advisable to:

 

(i) oppose fully and vigorously (A) any Action that is initiated (or
threatened to be initiated) challenging this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) any request for or the
entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental Order that
could prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the Closing, including, in the
case of either (A) or (B), by defending through litigation any Action asserted
by any Person in any court or before any Governmental Authority and vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal; and

(ii) agree to subject Parent or any of its Affiliates or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to (A) any different or additional Law, actuarial standard
or accounting standard, (B) any different or additional requirements related
to the contribution of capital, keep-well or capital maintenance agreements,
maintaining risk based capital levels or any restrictions on dividends or
other distributions or establishing or maintaining any trust or similar
mechanism for the benefit of any policyholders or class of policyholders of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (C) any requirement or condition to remove
or change any director or officer of Parent or its Affiliates or (D) any
requirement or condition to treat or deem any transaction, agreement or
arrangement as an affiliate transaction under applicable insurance Law.

However, none of Parent or the Company shall have any obligation to divest or
hold separately any of its material lines of business, material programs,
material products or material assets, or those of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, including the businesses, assets, or entities comprising the
Company, to satisfy its obligations in this _Section 6.03_ provided that
Parent shall give good faith consideration to requests for such action.

(c) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), acquire, purchase,
lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any
business, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization
or division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if
doing so would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consent,
approval, authorization or waiver

 



46  of any Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering a Governmental Order prohibiting
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such Governmental Order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) otherwise impair or
delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its material obligations
under this Agreement.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section
6.03(h)_, (i) Parent shall make a "Form A" filing and any similar filing
required by the Rhode Island Insurance Division with the Rhode
Island Insurance Division no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the
date hereof (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with
all cooperation, information, documents and other assistance reasonably
requested by Parent in order to make such "Form A" filing, including
providing Parent with copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries financial
projections and business plan documentation), (ii) each of Parent and the
Company shall file a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act

waiting period under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof and (iii) Parent shall make pre-acquisition notice "Form E"
filings, and related applications and filings with respect to approval or
expiration of waiting periods in connection with the acquisition of control of
NBIC and PIC in each jurisdiction where required by applicable Laws, as well
as any applicable exemption filings therefrom, no later than twenty (20)
Business Days after the date hereof.

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all consents, approvals,
authorizations or waivers of all Governmental Authorities necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party shall keep the other apprised on a prompt basis of the status of
such matters relating to such consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers.
The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance and shall
be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment on, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable
Law, any material filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and each party agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably
accept comments of the other parties thereon. The party responsible for any
such action shall promptly deliver to the other party evidence of the filing
or making of all filings, applications and submissions relating thereto, and
any supplement, amendment or item of additional information in connection
therewith. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent,
approval, authorization or waiver is required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing each other
copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise
each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization or
waiver will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent,
approval, authorization or waiver will be materially delayed or conditioned.
Prior to the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, and shall not permit any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, equityholders,
agents or representatives to participate in any live or telephonic meeting
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, approval
process, investigation or other inquiry (other than for routine or
ministerial matters) relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting,
provided that such attendance or participation does not materially delay the
scheduling of such live or telephonic meeting.

 

(f) The Company and Parent shall (i) promptly furnish, or cause to be
furnished, all agreements, documents, instruments, affidavits, statements or
information that may be required or requested by any Governmental Authority
concerning themselves or their Affiliates or its or their structure,
ownership, business, operations,

 



47  regulatory and legal compliance, assets, liabilities, financing, financial
condition or results of operations, or any of its or their directors,
officers, employees, partners, members or equityholders and the transactions
contemplated hereby and such other matters as may be required or requested and
(ii) make available their respective personnel and advisers to each other and,
upon request, any Governmental Authority, in connection with (A) the
preparation of any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
their behalf to, or (B) any review or approval process by, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 6.03(e)_
and this _Section 6.03(f)_ shall not apply with respect to Taxes or matters
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Company or its Affiliates be required to agree to take or enter
into any action which is not conditioned upon the Closing. Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall at any time prior to the Closing, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, file any application
with or request for non-disapproval by any Governmental Authority with
respect to any inter-affiliate transaction between NBIC and/or PIC, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, that would
require approval or non-disapproval under applicable Law unless such
application, approval or non-disapproval is required by any Governmental
Authority as a condition of such Governmental Authoritys approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no party or its Affiliates shall be required to
disclose to the other party or any of such partys Affiliates any information
that, in the reasonable judgment of the disclosing party: (i) would result in
the disclosure of Trade Secrets, confidential personal biographical
information, or confidential competitive information; or (ii) would violate
contractual commitments of confidentiality made to third parties in effect on
the date hereof.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.03_), for purposes of this _Section
6.03_, "reasonable best efforts" shall be deemed to include, subject to the
proviso below, complying with any requirements of applicable Law or
Governmental Order or of any Governmental Authority that may arise or be
imposed in connection with seeking and obtaining any consents, approvals,
authorizations, waivers or exemptions of any Governmental Authority necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
, that, for the purposes of this _Section 6.03_, "reasonable best efforts"
shall not require, or be deemed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates to agree to or take any action that would result in
any arrangements, conditions or restrictions imposed by any Governmental
Authority that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to have (I) a Company Material Adverse Effect or (II) a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole (any such arrangements, conditions or restrictions, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following shall be taken into account in determining whether a Burdensome
Condition has occurred or exists: (i) change in Law following the date hereof
generally applicable to property and casualty insurance companies licensed or
domiciled in Rhode Island; (ii) any arrangement, condition or restriction
imposed by statute generally on insurance companies domiciled in the State of
Rhode Island not arising by virtue of (A) a regulatory order or similar
instrument applicable only to Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (B) a condition or other restriction on any regulatory
approval order or similar instrument granted or proposed to be granted to
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any arrangement,
condition or restriction resulting from any proposed changes to the operations
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date that are
disclosed by Parent to Governmental Authorities in connection with any
consent, approval, authorization, waiver or exemption of any Governmental
Authority; (iv) any restriction on the declaration or payment of dividends or
distributions by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether imposed by
Law generally applicable to similarly situated Persons or otherwise not
resulting from a condition or other restriction set forth in _clause
(ii)(B)_ hereof; or (v) any arrangement, condition or restriction resulting
from the identity of, or any fact or circumstance relating to, Parent or any
of its control persons not resulting from a condition or other restriction
set forth in _clause (ii)(B)_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
Parent being entitled to invoke a Burdensome Condition, the parties and their
respective representatives shall meet and confer in good faith in

 



48  order to (x) exchange and review their respective views and positions as to
any Burdensome Condition or potential Burdensome Condition and (y) discuss and
present to, and engage with, the applicable Governmental Authority regarding
any approaches or actions that would avoid any actual Burdensome Condition or
mitigate its impact so it is no longer a Burdensome Condition; _provided_ that
ultimate decisions on Parents Form A application shall remain with Parent.

(i) Each of the Company and Parent shall work together in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner to prepare, negotiate and finalize, prior to
the Closing Date, the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and the
Letter of Transmittal.

 

(j) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the subscription agreement
with Parent substantially in the form of the Subscription Agreement, having
such changes as Parent may reasonably agree, to be executed by as many Non-
Identified Company Stockholders as is practicable (in addition to all of the
Identified Company Stockholders).

Section 6.04 _Company Stockholder Approval; Notice to Company Stockholders_.

(a) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy
of the executed action by written consent of the Identified Company
Stockholders (the " _Stockholder Written Consent_ ") which, individually or in
the aggregate, evidence the Company Stockholder Approval and include a waiver
of any dissenters or appraisal rights available to the Company Stockholders
under Section 262 of the DGCL; it being understood that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the Stockholder Written Consent to
be executed by as many Non-Identified Company Stockholders as is practicable
(in addition to all of the Identified Company Stockholders).

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall mail or distribute to the Company Stockholders entitled
thereto under the DGCL a notice and information statement (an " _Information
Statement_ ") which shall include (i) the notification required by Section
228(e) of the DGCL, (ii) a statement in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL regarding any appraisal rights of the Company Stockholders and (iii) such
other documents and information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
transactions contemplated hereby as may be required or appropriate under the
DGCL and other applicable Law, together with a copy of this Agreement and
Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the mailing or distribution of such
materials, the Company shall deliver to Parent a draft of the
Information Statement for Parents review and comment, and the Company shall
in good faith consider and incorporate any reasonable comments made by Parent
to such draft Information Statement in the final Information Statement, as
well as any redactions reasonably proposed by Parent to any of the materials
included therewith.

Section 6.05 _Merger Sub Stockholder Approval_. Promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) following the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall deliver to the Company a copy of the executed action by written consent
of Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, adopting this Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Parent Stockholder Approval_. Without the prior written
approval of the Company, Parent shall not file a proxy statement with the SEC,
call, give notice of, convene or hold a meeting of its stockholders or set the
record date of any such meeting, in each case, to adopt and approve
this Agreement or approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Convertible Debt Offering and the transactions contemplated by the
Subscription Agreement.

 

Section 6.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to complete, as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (and, in any event, no later than one hundred five (105) days after
the date hereof), in the discretion of Parent, (i) the Convertible Debt
Offering or (ii) a substitute financing 

 



49  (whether debt, equity or any combination thereof) that is on terms
satisfactory to Parent in its discretion and that is sufficient to enable
Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Substitute Financing_ "), including, with respect to the
Convertible Debt Offering or the Substitute Financing, as applicable, to
negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Convertible Debt Offering or the Substitute Financing, as applicable, so that
such agreements are in effect no later than one hundred five (105) days after
the date hereof.

 

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives
(including its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants
and advisors) to provide such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with securing the Acquisition Financing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause upon reasonable advance notice by
Parent, appropriate officers and employees (including senior management of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to be available for meetings, including
management presentations and "road show" appearances, the preparation of
disclosure documents in connection with any such Acquisition Financing,
including drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, and sessions with
prospective lenders and their respective advisors, in each case, that are
customary for financings of a type similar to the Acquisition Financing, (ii)
cause to be promptly provided to Parent, its Affiliates and its financing
sources all material financial information and other pertinent information in
their possession with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by Parent or Parents
financing sources, including information and projections prepared by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated hereby, provided such financing
sources shall be deemed to be one of Parents "representatives" under
the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to all obligations imposed therein
upon a "representative," and (iii) assist Parent and its financing sources in
a timely manner with the preparation of lender and investor
presentations, customary and reasonably available marketing materials and
similar documents and other materials reasonably required by Parent or its
financing sources (including (x) providing customary executed authorization
and management representation letters and (y) in Parents preparation of any
pro forma financial statements required to be delivered by Parents financing
sources).

 

Section 6.08 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For six (6) years following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing
Date were directors or officers of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnitees_") with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request
of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to
the Closing Date. Parent agrees that, for six (6) years following the
Closing, all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to advancement of expenses,
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable Organizational Documents) of the
Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on
the date hereof, and any indemnification agreements of the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof,
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For six (6) years following the Closing, such
rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of any of the DandO Indemnitees, unless such
modification is required by Law or approved by such DandO Indemnitee. In
addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to advance, pay or reimburse any expenses of
any DandO Indemnitee under this _Section 6.08_ as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the
extent required by applicable Law.

(b) Parent, for six (6) years following the Closing, except as required by
applicable Law, shall cause (i) the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees
with respect to limitation of liability, advancement of expenses and
indemnification than are set

 



50  forth in such documents as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (ii) the Organizational
Documents of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to contain
provisions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees with respect to limitation
of liability, advancement of expenses and indemnification than are set forth
in such documents as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, with any DandO Indemnitee in the defense of any claim
that is subject to the limitation of liability, advancement of expenses or
indemnification as contemplated by this _Section 6.08_ and shall, except as
prohibited by applicable Law, provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records and
information; _provided_ , that if access to any records and information that
is subject to (i) an attorney-client or other legal privilege would give rise
to a material risk of waiver of such privilege or (ii) confidentiality or
non-disclosure restrictions would result in a material breach of such
restrictions, such records and information shall not be made so accessible;
_provided_ , further that if Parent does not provide access or information in
reliance on the foregoing, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to such director or officer in a manner
that would not waive such a privilege or violate the applicable Law or
Contract.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide or maintain in effect for six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and
officers and corporate liability insurance with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries that (i) provides coverage for claims asserted within six (6)
years of the Closing Date arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Closing and (ii) covers those individuals who are covered by the
directors and officers and corporate liability insurance policy or policies
provided for directors and officers of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing Policy_ ") on
terms comparable in all respects to the Existing Policy, and such coverage
shall contain minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors and
officers and corporate liability insurance coverage for directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the amount of coverage at
least equal to that of the Existing Policy and deductibles no larger than
those of the Existing Policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such "run-off" or other coverage is not available at a
cost not greater than three hundred and fifty percent (350%) of the
annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement under the Existing
Policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ "), then the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is reasonably
practicable under substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as
do not exceed the Insurance Cap. Parent (on the one hand) and the Company
Stockholders (on the other hand) shall each pay and bear fifty percent (50%)
of the economic burden of the premium of the DandO Tail Policy (with the
Company Stockholders fifty percent (50%) share to be included in the
Transaction Expenses).

 

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.08_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.08_ applies
without the consent of each affected DandO Indemnitee. The provisions of this
_Section 6.08_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his, her or its heirs and his or her
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Law, Contract or otherwise. DandO Indemnitees shall be a third party
beneficiary for the purposes of this _Section 6.08_.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section 6.08_.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers, it being 

 



51  understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
6.08 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 

Section 6.09 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Upon and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each individual who is employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
remains in employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_
") with base salary or hourly wage rate, cash incentive or sales commission
opportunity and employee benefits (including severance benefits), in each
case, that are determined by Parent in the same manner as determined for
similarly situated employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries may change the
compensation or benefits of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any
reason or for no reason.

(b) Upon and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and
all Liabilities to, or in respect of, each Continuing Employee, and each
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries, arising under the terms
of, or in connection with, any Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms
thereof. Each employment agreement or offer letter by and between the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries and a Continuing Employee that is in
effect immediately prior to the Closing shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms thereof at all times following the
Closing.

(c) Upon and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Continuing Employee with full credit
for such Continuing Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and predecessors prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
benefit accruals and determination of the level of benefits (including, for
purposes of vacation and severance, but not including equity compensation and
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under any
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their applicable Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate on or following the Effective Time (each, a " _Parent
Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a health or welfare
plan, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of such Continuing Employees due to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show
evidence of good health and (ii) credit each such Continuing Employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such employee under
any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and whether such employee has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum for such year. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize and credit the vacation days and
paid time off accrued by such Continuing Employees prior to the Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if to the
extent the Company reasonably determines, in consultation with Parent, that

give rise to excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code, the
Company shall take the following actions prior to the Closing Date: (i)
obtain waivers of any excess parachute payment from each Person who has or may
have a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection
with the Transactions that would be deemed to constitute "excess

pursuant to the foregoing _clause (i)_ ) that would, as a result of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be deemed to
constitute "excess 

 



52  parachute payments." The Company shall provide to Parent material
calculations, waiver agreements, disclosure to shareholders, shareholder
consents and other relevant documentation and information necessary to
complete the actions required by this _Section 6.09(d)_ prior to finalizing
and/or executing any documents so that Parent shall have an opportunity to

of this Agreement is intended to, or does, require the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to keep any Person employed for any period of time or
constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Benefit
Plan. The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are solely for the benefit of
the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 6.09_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other
Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of

Section 6.10 _Interim Balance Sheets_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement, no
later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, the Company
shall deliver to Parent (a) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the end of such calendar month, prepared in accordance with
GAAP as applied in a manner consistent with the accounting principles and
practices used in preparing the balance sheets included in the Company Annual
Financial Statements and in the same form as the Reference Balance Sheet
(each such balance sheet, the " _Interim Balance Sheet_ ") and (b) based on
such Interim Balance Sheet, a calculation of the Book Value of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the end of such calendar month.

Section 6.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the Merger, if any, shall be paid by Parent when due, whether levied on
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or any Company
Stockholder, and Parent shall timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to any such Transfer Taxes and, as soon as
reasonably practicable, shall provide a copy of any such filed Tax Returns or
other documentation to the Stockholder Representative.

less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause to be delivered to Parent prior to the Closing written resignations of
each director of the Company and each director of each Subsidiary, which
resignations shall be effective as of the Effective Time.

Section 6.13 _Affiliate Transactions_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall, effective upon, and subject to the consummation of the Closing,
terminate the transactions and Contracts between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (on the one hand) and any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries Affiliates or other related parties or Pine Brook or Soros (on
the other hand), to the extent such transactions and Contracts are set forth
on _Section 6.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

Section 6.14 _Title Insurance Policies_. In connection with the Closing,
Parent shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to obtain title
insurance policies with respect to the Owned Real Property. The Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in obtaining such title insurance policies
but shall have no obligation to deliver owners affidavits, gap indemnities
and non-imputation endorsement affidavits. The Company shall also provide
Parent with such other documentation reasonably necessary or customary, as
determined by the Company, to issue title policies and endorsements on the
Real Property.

Section 6.15 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party and at the
expense of the party so requesting, each other party shall execute and deliver
to such requesting party such documents and take such other action as such
requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



53 Section 6.16 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement and before the Closing, cause to be issued
and conditionally bound a purchaser-side representations and warranties
insurance policy with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in a form that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "
_R andW Insurance Policy_"). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide
Parent with all cooperation, information and other assistance as is reasonably
necessary for Parent to comply with the immediately preceding sentence and for
the RandW Insurance Policy to be issued and bound at the Closing in a form that
is reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(b) In the event of any termination of the RandW Insurance Policy (or the
binder agreement with respect thereto) in connection with the termination of
this Agreement, Parent agrees that 50% of all amounts refunded or paid to
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with any such termination shall be
paid to the Company (subject to a cap of $625,000) within three (3) Business
Days following receipt thereof by or on behalf of Parent.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
understand and agree that (i) for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the RandW
Insurance Policy shall affect any of the terms of this Agreement and Parent
shall cause such insurance policy to acknowledge that the insurer thereunder
has no right of subrogation (and recourse) against any Company Stockholder
other than in the case of fraud and (ii) following the Closing, whether or not
the RandW Insurance Policy is obtained, the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for Parent for any breach of any representation or
warranty contained herein, other than in the case of actual fraud, and Parent,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers and stockholders, shall not assert and hereby waives any such
claims, other than in the case of actual fraud.

(b) by the Company or Parent, if the Closing has not occurred on or before
April 8, 2018 (as such date may be extended pursuant to  _Section 9.14_, the

the terms and conditions herein; _provided_  that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ shall not be available to any
party seeking to terminate whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing

(d) by Parent if (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material breach of
any of its respective obligations hereunder and (ii) the Company is in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or obligations
hereunder that renders or would render the conditions set forth in  _Section

Date, and such breach is either (A) not capable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) twenty
(20) Business Days after the giving of written notice by Parent to the Company
and (y) two (2) Business Days prior to the Outside Date;

 

(e) by the Company if (i) the Company is not in material breach of any of its
obligations hereunder and (ii) either Parent or Merger Sub is in material

irrevocably waived by Parent (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be

 



56  satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied
if the Closing Date were the date that notice of termination is delivered by
the Company to Parent), (ii) the Company irrevocably confirms to Parent in
writing that (A) all of the conditions to the obligations of Parent to
consummate the Closing have been satisfied or waived by Parent (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by the Company at
the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing
Date were the date that notice of termination is delivered by the Company to
Parent) and (B) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause to be satisfied
or waived those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, and (iii) the Convertible Debt Offering or any Substitute Financing
shall not have closed on or before the date that is one hundred five (105)

Section 8.03 _Termination Fee_.

") in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company, which such Termination Fee shall be paid no later
than three (3) Business Days after notice of such termination of this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for any
such termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_, except in the
case of actual fraud or any intentional and material breach by Parent of
_Section 6.07_ by Parent.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Parent fails pay the Termination Fee when due, Parent shall
also pay any reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
an Action that results in a Governmental Order for such amount
against Parent. The parties agree and understand that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

Section 8.04 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  _Section 8.01_, this Agreement shall thereafter become void
and have no effect, and no party shall have any liability to any other party,
its Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, members, equityholders, agents or representatives in connection
with this Agreement, except that (a) the obligations of the parties contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement and in _Section 8.03_, this _Section 8.04_
and in  _Article IX_ shall survive and (b) termination will not relieve any
party from liability for any intentional and material breach of this Agreement
or actual fraud prior to such termination and the parties hereto acknowledge
that any termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_ will be deemed to be an intentional and material breach by the
Company.

Agreement may be amended or modified if, and only if, (a) such amendment or
modification is in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto, (b) such
amendment or modification has been authorized by the respective boards

interests or obligations under it may be directly or indirectly assigned,
delegated, sublicensed or transferred by any of the parties, in whole or in

their respective rights (but not their respective obligations) under this
Agreement (a) to any of their Affiliates after the Closing, (b) any of their
lenders as collateral security for their obligations under any of their debt
financing arrangements (including any lender with respect to the Convertible
Debt Offering or any Substitute Financing) or (c) any subsequent purchaser of

(however any purchase by such purchaser is structured). Any attempted
or purported assignment in violation of this _Section 9.04_ will be null and
void. Subject to the preceding provisions of this _Section 9.04_, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

Section 9.05  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the

Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto), the Letter

to recover, through an Action brought by the Company, damages from Parent in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by Parent, in which event the damages
recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of the Company
Stockholders shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would
have been recoverable by such holders if all such holders brought an action
against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries

 



59  hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Persons intended to benefit
from the provisions of _Section 6.08_, each of whom are third party
beneficiaries of _Section 6.08_, shall have the right to enforce such

or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the parties may,
without the prior written consent of the other parties, make such public
statement or issue such public communication (a) as may be required by
applicable Law or stock exchange rules and, if practicable under the
circumstances, after reasonable prior consultation with the other parties, or
(b) to enforce their respective rights or remedies under this Agreement.

or in the event of actual fraud, none of the Company or its Affiliates, nor
any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
members, equityholders, agents or representatives, makes or has made, and none
of Parent or its Affiliates, nor any of its or their directors, officers,
employees, partners, members, equityholders, agents or representatives relies
or has relied upon, any other representation or warranty on behalf of the
Company, including as to the accuracy or completeness of any of information
(including any projections, estimates or other forward-looking information)
provided (including set forth in the Electronic Data Room, or provided in any
management presentations, information memoranda, supplemental information or
other materials) or otherwise made available by or on behalf of the Company
or as to the probable success or profitability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company expressly disclaims, and Parent (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, and any of its or its Affiliates respective directors,
officers, employees, partners, members, equityholders, agents or
representatives) expressly disclaims any reliance on, any and all other
representations and warranties, whether express or implied.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_,
neither Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, equityholders,
agents or representatives, makes or has made, and none of the Company or its
Affiliates, nor any of its or their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, members, equityholders, agents or representatives relies
or has relied upon, any other representation or warranty on behalf of Parent
and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub expressly disclaim, and the Company (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and any of its or its Affiliates
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, equityholders,
agents or representatives) expressly disclaims any reliance on, any and all
other representations and warranties, whether express or implied.

Section 9.09 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, including with respect to the payment of Transaction Expenses if
the Closing occurs, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relating to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without respect to its applicable principles of
conflicts of laws that might require the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery

 



60  does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (and the Complex Commercial Litigation Division thereof
if such division has jurisdiction over the particular matter), or if the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, any
federal or state court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) (" _Delaware Courts_ "), and any appellate court from any decision
thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and agrees that
all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in the
Delaware Courts, (b) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement in the Delaware
Courts, including any objection based on its place of incorporation or
domicile, (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court and
(d) agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each of the parties consents and agrees that service
of process, summons, notice or document for any action permitted hereunder may
be delivered by registered mail addressed to it at the applicable address set
forth in _Section 9.02_ or in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

Section 9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE BASED UPON,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR
VALIDITY THEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS HAVE REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT ANY SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION
9.11. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A TRUE AND CORRECT COPY OF
THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and may be delivered by
facsimile or other electronic means (including by an e-mail that contains a
portable document format (.pdf) file) intended to preserve the original
graphic or pictorial appearance of a document.

 

Section 9.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as
would be enforceable.

Section 9.14  _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that money damages or other

 



61  legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to
perform or breach. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or
other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches and threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such
action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. The parties further agree that (a)
by seeking any remedy provided for in this _Section 9.14_, a party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to such party under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in
this _Section 9.14_ shall require any party to institute any action for (or
limit such partys right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this  _Section 9.14_ before exercising any other right under this
Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any Action in
accordance with this Agreement to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof against any other party, the Outside Date shall
be automatically extended (i) for the period during which such Action is
pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (ii) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action on good cause shown, as
the case may be.

Section 9.15  _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement or the Subscription Agreement, Parent (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that, other than in the
event of actual fraud, no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or the Subscription
Agreement shall be had against any former, current or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, Affiliate, partner, member, manager,
equityholder, agent or representative of any Company Stockholder or of any
Affiliate or assignee of any Company Stockholder (collectively, " _Non-
Recourse Parties_"), as such, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or
by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation
or other applicable Law or Governmental Order, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that, other than in the case of actual fraud, no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any Non-Recourse Party, as such, for any obligation of the Company under
this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with
this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations or their creation, or otherwise by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation or execution or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation) waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Recourse Parties,
other than in the case of actual fraud. Each Non-Recourse Party shall be a
third party beneficiary for the purposes of this _Section 9.15_.

Section 9.16 _Legal Representatives_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties that each of the Company and certain Affiliates of Pine Brook and
Soros have retained Skadden to act as its counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that Skadden has not acted as
counsel for any other party in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that none of the other parties has the status of a client of
Skadden for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.
Each party hereby agrees that, in the event that any dispute arises after the
Closing between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of Pine Brook and Soros
or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Skadden may represent
either or both of Pine Brook and Soros in such dispute even though the
interests of Pine Brook and Soros may be directly adverse to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and even though Skadden formerly may have represented the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in any matter substantially related to
such dispute. Each of the Company (on behalf of itself and the Surviving
Corporation), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, in
connection with any future dispute between Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any of Pine Brook and Soros or their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, with respect to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as to all communications among
Skadden, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, Pine Brook and Soros
that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence and any other applicable
legal privilege belongs to Pine Brook and Soros, as applicable, and may be

 



62  controlled by such Person and shall not pass to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates upon the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party (other than a party, Pine Brook
and Soros and any other Company Stockholder or their respective Affiliates),
on the other hand, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Skadden to such third party. Skadden shall be a third party beneficiary
for purposes of this _Section 9.16_.

Section 9.17 _Appointment and Authorization of the Stockholder
Representative_.

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the execution and delivery of a Letter of
Transmittal and without any further act of any of the Company Stockholders,
each Company Stockholder irrevocably appoints PBRA, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") as its
representative, agent, proxy, and true and lawful attorney-in-fact, for and
in its name, place and stead, with full power and authority including the
power of substitution and resubstitution and as fully and to the same extent
and with the same effect as each such Company Stockholder can, might or could
under applicable Law if personally present, to: (i) perform all acts and deeds
of each such Company Stockholder as contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith, (iii) negotiate claims, disputes, or actions, suits
or proceedings, and to compromise or settle any claims, disputes or actions,
suits or proceedings, in each case, arising under, or relating to this
Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith, (iv) receive and disburse to, or
cause to be received and disbursed to any such Company Stockholder any funds
to which such Company Stockholder is entitled under this Agreement, (v)
withhold any amounts to be received or disbursed to any such Company
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or to satisfy any and all obligations
or liabilities of any Company Stockholder or the Stockholder Representative in
the performance of any of their commitments hereunder, (vi) to execute,
deliver and perform under any amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith (without the prior approval of any Company Stockholder),
(vii) give and receive notices to any such Company Stockholder under this
Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby, (viii) take any action contemplated hereunder to be taken by
the Stockholder Representative and (ix) take all other lawful actions to be
taken by or on behalf of any such Company Stockholder in connection with this
Agreement and the other agreements, instruments and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith.

(b) Any and all other powers of attorney heretofore made by any such Company
Stockholder authorizing any Person to do or take any of the foregoing actions
or any part thereof are hereby revoked. All rights, power and authority of the
Stockholder Representative to exercise any and all of the rights, power and
authority granted as aforesaid shall commence and be in full force and effect
from the date hereof and shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity.
The aforesaid power of attorney is given primarily for the business and
commercial purpose and shall not be affected by the subsequent
death, disability, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation,
insolvency or cessation of existence of any Company Stockholder. The aforesaid
proxy and power of attorney are coupled with an interest and are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholder Representative.

(c) The Stockholder Representative may perform its duties as such through sub-
agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall have no liability for any acts or
omissions of any such sub-agent or attorney if selected by it with reasonable
care. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Stockholder Representative on behalf of any and all Company Stockholders with
respect to all matters relating to this Agreement (including the Escrow
Agreement), and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Company Stockholder by the Stockholder
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Company Stockholder by the Stockholder Representative,
as legally binding upon such Company Stockholder, as applicable. All
decisions and actions by the Stockholder

 



63  Representative taken pursuant to the aforesaid proxy and power of attorney,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be binding upon each
Company Stockholder, and no such Company Stockholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Any obligation of
Parent to make any payment to or for the benefit of any Company Stockholder
under or in connection with this Agreement can be made to the Stockholder
Representative and Parent can rely without independent verification on the
Stockholder Representative making further payment in the proper amount to the
proper Persons under this Agreement or applicable Law.
