A. PropCo Seller owns fifty-one percent (51%) of the membership interests in

and such portion of the limited liability company interests in the PropCo, the
"PropCo Interests"). The PropCo owns, directly or indirectly, one hundred
percent (100%) of the membership interests in each of the subsidiaries listed
on Schedule A-1 attached hereto (each, a "PropCo Sub"). Each PropCo Sub
specified on Schedule B attached hereto owns one or more of the independent
living, assisted living, skilled nursing and/or memory care facilities listed
on Schedule B in entrance fee continuing care retirement communities (each, a
"Facility") and leases such Facility or Facilities to the OpCo Sub or OpCo
Subs (as defined herein) specified on Schedule B.

B. OpCo Seller owns fifty-one percent (51%) of the membership interests in
CCRC OpCo Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "OpCo" and,

Each OpCo Sub either leases the Facility specified on Schedule B from the
applicable PropCo Sub specified on Schedule B or owns such Facility as
specified on Schedule B and, in any case, has engaged BKD Twenty-One
Management Company, Inc. ("Manager"), a subsidiary of Brookdale and an
affiliate of Sellers, to manage and operate such Facility pursuant to a
management agreement and related master pooling agreement (such management
agreements and master pooling agreement, as amended, collectively, the
"Management Agreements").

C. PropCo Seller desires to sell to PropCo Purchaser all of the PropCo
Interests, and PropCo Purchaser desires to purchase the PropCo Interests from
PropCo Seller, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.



D. OpCo Seller desires to sell to OpCo Purchaser all of the OpCo Interests,
and OpCo Purchaser desires to purchase the OpCo Interests from OpCo Seller, on
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

E. Purchasers are each wholly-owned, direct or indirect, subsidiaries of HCP.

this Agreement, concurrently herewith, (i) HCP and Brookdale are entering into
that certain Master Transactions and Cooperation Agreement of even date with
the Effective Date (as the same may be amended or modified in accordance with
its terms, the "MTCA") and (ii) Manager, Life Care Services LLC, an Iowa
limited liability company ("New Manager"), Emeritus Corporation (a subsidiary
of Brookdale), and each applicable OpCo Sub is entering into an Operations
Transfer Agreement of even date with the Effective Date hereof with respect to
each Facility leased or owned by such OpCo Sub as identified on Schedule B

G. Prior to the Closing (as defined herein), the parties hereto and their
affiliates will consummate an internal restructuring of the JV Entities to the
extent required in accordance with Section 2.2 of the MTCA (the "Internal

Freedom Village Bradenton (FL) and Foxwood Springs (MO) (collectively, the
"Sale Facilities") will be restructured prior to the Closing as part of the

Facilities are not included as Facilities on Schedule B, (ii) the entities
that own such Sale Facilities are not included as PropCo Subs on Schedule A-1
and (iii) the entities that lease such Sale Facilities are not included as
OpCo Subs on Schedule A-2.

H. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable

the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

PURCHASE AND SALE

1.1 Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the

and (b) OpCo Seller shall sell and assign the OpCo Interests to OpCo Purchaser
free and clear of any liens (other than Permitted JV Interest Liens), and OpCo

Purchase Price between the PropCo Interests and the OpCo Interests.

(b) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be paid by Purchasers (or caused

limited liability company agreement of the OpCo.

2.3(e) of the MTCA, HCP and its affiliates (including Purchasers) have the
option to pay in full all or any of the Existing Financing (as defined in the
MTCA) at Closing. In connection therewith, the parties hereto shall, and shall
cause their respective affiliates, to comply with the provisions of Section
2.3(e) of the MTCA.

ARTICLE II

COVENANTS AND CLOSING CONDITIONS

2.1 Interim Covenants.

(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending at the
Closing, without limiting or expanding Sellers' obligations under the limited
liability company agreements for each JV Entity or Manager's obligations under
any Management Agreements or OTAs, Sellers shall, and shall cause Manager to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws,
statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, codes, orders, judgments, writs,
injunctions, acts, decrees, decisions, rulings, awards and other requirements
having the force of law. As used in this Agreement, the term "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall mean efforts that would be reasonable in the real
estate industry under circumstances similar to the applicable matter,
including, if necessary, the expenditure of reasonable monies; provided that
in no event shall the same include any obligation to institute or threaten
legal proceedings. 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at or prior to
Closing, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts and
cooperate reasonably and in good faith to obtain any governmental approvals
(including the Required Governmental Approvals (as defined herein)), and
deliver any notices, filings or submissions, to Governmental Authorities (as
defined herein) or any other third parties (including any Facility-level
lenders), that are required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, providing any information
requested by any such Governmental Authorities or other third parties
(including Facility-level lenders) in connection therewith. "Governmental
Authorities" means any federal, state or local governmental or quasi-
governmental agency, authority, official, tribunal, or Medicaid managed care
organization.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of
their respective affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
take all actions necessary to consummate the Internal Restructuring
(including, without limitation, obtaining any necessary consents and executing
the MDCA).

2.2 MLR Demand Notes. In consideration of the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the MTCA, all MLR demand notes (including any
interest thereon) issued by Sellers or their affiliates (excluding the JV
Entities and their subsidiaries) in favor of the JV Entities or their
subsidiaries or held by or on behalf of the JV Entities or their subsidiaries
shall be distributed to Sellers, without any payment therefor, at the Closing.

2.3 Release of Guarantees. Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at or prior to the Closing (or, if not obtained at or prior
to the Closing, as soon as practicable thereafter), the termination of, and
full release of Sellers and their respective affiliates (excluding the JV
Entities and their subsidiaries) from, all obligations of Sellers and their
respective affiliates (excluding the JV Entities and their subsidiaries) under
all guarantees, clawback arrangements, keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity
or contribution obligations, support agreements, surety bonds and/or other
contingent obligations in favor of (i) any member of the JV Entities or their
subsidiaries or (ii) any other third party in connection with the business of
the JV Entities or their subsidiaries (including, without limitation, lenders
to the JV Entities or their subsidiaries) (collectively, as amended, the
"Seller Guarantees"), in each case, to the extent practicable; provided,
however, that Purchasers shall not be obligated to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the terminations or releases of Sellers and their respective
affiliates (A) from any Seller Guarantees except to the extent identified on
Schedule 2.3 or otherwise identified in writing by Sellers to Purchasers prior
to or within ninety (90) days after the Closing or (B) in respect of any
Entrance Fee Liabilities (as defined below) in favor of any resident of any of
the Facilities or his or her heirs or estate (the "Entrance Fee Guarantees").
To the extent any Seller Guarantees (including any Entrance Fee Guarantees)
are not terminated or released, from and after the Closing, Purchasers and
HCP, on a joint and several basis, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers and their affiliates (excluding the JV Entities and their
subsidiaries) from and against any and all Losses (as defined herein) incurred
by any of them relating to the Seller Guarantees (including any Entrance Fee
Guarantees). For purposes of this Agreement, "Entrance Fee Liabilities" shall
mean, from time to time with respect to any resident (or his or her heirs or
estate) at any Facility, the aggregate service 

and financial obligations owing to such resident under such resident's
applicable entrance fee agreement, including, without limitation, the
obligations to (a) refund any portion of the entrance fees paid by such
resident, (b) make My Choice or PIPP refunds or repayments (however designated
on such Facility's financial statements), (c) make available free or
discounted resident services, care or health benefit days, or provide
continuing life care services or benefits to such resident, (d) repurchase
from such resident the life estate real property interest of such resident in
such resident's unit at such Facility or (e) pay any master trust liabilities.

2.4 Termination of Management Agreements. At Closing, Purchasers and Sellers
shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates (including the OpCo Subs
and, with respect to Sellers, Manager) to, duly execute and deliver the
Omnibus Termination Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the
"Termination Agreement") terminating all of the management agreements with
respect to the Facilities, and the master pooling agreement, effective as of
Closing, all as more particularly described therein. In connection with such
termination and as further provided for in the Termination Agreement,
Purchasers shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates to, pay to
Manager, concurrently with the payment of the Purchase Price to Sellers, One
Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) as a termination fee (the "Termination
Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account or
bank accounts designated by Manager in writing. The Termination Fee shall be
allocable to the Management Agreements being terminated pursuant to the
Termination Agreement as provided for therein.

2.5 Tax Proceedings. Following the Closing, in the event that any refunds or
other amounts are received by any of the JV Entities, Purchasers or their

tax proceedings set forth on Schedule 2.5 or (b) any other audit, examination,
contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any tax authority
relating to real or personal property taxes imposed with respect to the JV
Entities or the Facilities for any period prior to the Closing Date (for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any such proceeding relating to taxes
arising from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other transaction occurring outside the ordinary course of
business), Purchasers shall pay (or cause to be paid to) to Sellers, as a
purchase price adjustment, fifty-one percent (51%) of such amounts received,
by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, within ten
(10) business days after any of the JV Entities, Purchasers or their
respective affiliates receives such amounts, less reasonable out of pocket
collection costs incurred by any of the JV Entities, Purchasers or their
respective affiliates in connection therewith. Similarly, in the event that
any additional amount of real or personal property taxes (inclusive of

contemplated by this Agreement or any other transaction occurring outside the
ordinary course of business) is assessed against or required to be paid by any
of the JV Entities, Purchasers or their respective affiliates with respect to
any tax proceeding described in the preceding sentence, Sellers shall pay (or
cause to be paid to) to Purchasers, as a purchase price adjustment, fifty-one
percent (51%) of such amount due, by wire transfer or delivery of other
immediately available funds, within ten (10) business days after the final
determination by the applicable tax authority of such amount. Purchasers shall
keep Sellers informed of any such tax proceedings and shall not without the
prior written consent of Sellers (such consent not to be 

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such tax proceeding, or agree to any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall not be duplicative of any

recognized accounting firm, other than the primary accounting firms providing
accounting services to Brookdale or HCP.

"Accounting Guidelines" means the guidelines, principles and methodologies
attached as Exhibit A hereto. 

"Average Daily NOI" means, for any period, the quotient of (i) an amount equal
to the net operating income (or loss) of the JV Entities during such period,
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Guidelines, divided by (ii) the

the following, in each case, as determined in accordance with the Accounting
Guidelines: management fee expenses, debt service, interest income and rent
income and expense.

"Net Working Capital" means, as of any date of determination, those assets of
the JV Entities that would be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
JV Entities minus those liabilities of the JV Entities that would be reflected
on a consolidated balance sheet of the JV Entities, in each case, as
determined in accordance with the Accounting Guidelines.

(b) Preparation of Balance Sheet and Average Daily NOI.

(i) Not less than two (2) business days prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
provide Purchasers (A) an estimated consolidated balance sheet (the "Estimated
Balance Sheet") for the JV Entities as of (x) the Closing Date, if the Closing
Date is the last day of a calendar month, or (y) the last day of the calendar
month preceding the calendar month of the Closing Date, if the Closing Date is
any other day of a calendar month (in either case, the "Balance Sheet Date"),
which shall include Sellers' good faith calculation, prepared from the books
and records of the JV Entities and based on the most recently available
financial information, of the estimated Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the day of the Balance Sheet Date (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital"), (B) a statement reflecting Sellers' good faith estimate of the
Average Daily NOI for the three (3) calendar month period ending on the
Balance Sheet Date (the "Estimated Average Daily NOI"), and (C) a calculation
of the Purchase Price payable at Closing based thereon. Each of the Estimated
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Average Daily NOI shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Guidelines.

(ii) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to

for the three (3) calendar month period ending on the Balance Sheet Date (the

(iii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Three-Month Average Daily NOI (the "Objection Period"), Purchasers by
written notice to Sellers may object to Sellers' calculation of (A) the
Closing Net Working Capital as set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or (B)
the Three-Month Average Daily NOI, setting forth in such notice a statement
describing in reasonable detail Purchasers' objection (the "Objection Notice")
and Purchasers' proposal or proposals with respect to 

the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or the Three-Month Average
Daily NOI; provided that Purchasers may object to the Closing Balance Sheet or
the Three-Month Average Daily NOI based only on the existence of mathematical
or factual errors contained therein or on the failure of either the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Three-Month Average Daily NOI to be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Guidelines. Within thirty (30) days following
timely delivery of the Objection Notice, Sellers and Purchasers shall attempt,
in good faith, to resolve all disputes properly contained in the Objection
Notice. If Sellers and Purchasers do not obtain a final resolution within
thirty (30) days after Purchasers deliver an Objection Notice, then Sellers
and Purchasers shall submit such dispute to an Accounting Firm. Promptly, but
not later than thirty (30) days after the dispute has been submitted to the
Accounting Firm, the Accounting Firm shall determine (based solely on
presentations or materials submitted by Purchasers and Sellers to the
Accounting Firm, and not by independent review) (i) whether the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Three-Month Average Daily NOI, as applicable, contained
mathematical or factual errors or failed to be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Guidelines, and (ii) if any such error or failure exists, its
calculations to correct for such error or failure. In determining any disputed
item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to such item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchasers or Sellers or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Purchasers or Sellers.
For the purposes of the Accounting Firm's calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital or the Three-Month Average Daily NOI, the amounts to be
included shall be the appropriate amounts from the Closing Balance Sheet or
the Three-Month Average Daily NOI, as applicable, as to items that are not in
dispute, and the amounts determined by the Accounting Firm as to items that
are in dispute. Purchasers and Sellers shall cooperate with the Accounting
Firm in making its determination and such determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto absent manifest error.

(iv) If Purchasers do not deliver an Objection Notice during the Objection
Period, then the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital as set forth
in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Three-Month Average Daily NOI as provided
by Sellers shall be deemed to have been accepted and shall be final and
binding on all parties. The term "Final Closing Balance Sheet" means (A) the
Closing Balance Sheet, if Purchasers accept the Closing Balance Sheet as
delivered or do not deliver an Objection Notice during the Objection Period,
or (B) the Closing Balance Sheet as finally determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.4(b)(iii) to reflect the resolution of any
objections thereto, if Purchasers deliver an Objection Notice during the
Objection Period. The term "Actual Net Working Capital" means the Closing Net
Working Capital calculated pursuant to the Final Closing Balance Sheet. The
term "Final Three-Month Average Daily NOI" means (x) the Three-Month Average
Daily NOI, if Purchasers accept the Three-Month Average Daily NOI as delivered
or do not deliver an Objection Notice during the Objection Period, or (y) the
Three-Month Average Daily NOI as finally determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.4(b)(iii) to reflect the resolution of any
objections thereto, if Purchasers deliver an Objection Notice during the
Objection Period. The term "Actual Average Daily NOI" means the Three-Month
Average Daily NOI calculated pursuant to the Final Three-Month Average Daily
NOI. 

(v) In the event the parties hereto submit any unresolved objections to the
Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in Section 3.4(b)(iii) above,
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other, shall share
responsibility for the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm equally.

(vi) Sellers will make the work papers and back-up materials used in preparing
the Estimated Balance Sheet, the Estimated Average Daily NOI, the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Three-Month Average Daily NOI available to Purchasers'
accountant and other representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice at any time during (A) the review by Purchasers of the Estimated
Balance Sheet, the Estimated Average Daily NOI, the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Three-Month Average Daily NOI, as applicable, and (B) the resolution by
Purchasers and Sellers of any objections thereto.

(c) Purchase Price Adjustment Based on Net Working Capital and Average Daily
NOI at Closing. The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased
by an amount equal to fifty-one percent (51%) of the sum of (i) the Estimated
Net Working Capital plus (ii) an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Estimated Average Daily NOI, multiplied by (B) the number of days following
the Balance Sheet Date, up to but not including the Closing Date plus (iii)
during the period from the Balance Sheet Date to the Closing Date (A) the
proceeds from all entrance fee sales (including both the refundable and
nonrefundable portions thereof and any promissory note received in connection
therewith), minus (B) the amount of any entrance fee refunds that are due to
be paid from the cash proceeds of any entrance fee units sold and where the
refundable portion of such entrance fee for any such sold unit has not been
actually refunded to the former resident of such unit, provided that all
conditions precedent for such refund to such former resident have been met
with the sole exception being the passage of time, and such period is less
than 120 days (the sum of (i) plus (ii) plus (iii) is referred to herein as
the "Estimated Adjustment Amount"); provided, however, if the Estimated
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Purchase Price payable at the
Closing shall be decreased by an amount equal to fifty-one percent (51%) of
the Estimated Adjustment Amount.

(d) Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Based on Net Working Capital and
Average Daily NOI. Following determination of the Actual Net Working Capital
and the Actual Average Daily NOI, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows:

(i) If the Actual Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased by fifty-one percent (51%) of
the amount by which the Actual Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital.

(ii) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Actual Net Working
Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by fifty-one percent (51%) of
the amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Actual Net
Working Capital. 

(iii) If the Actual Average Daily NOI exceeds the Estimated Average Daily NOI,
the Purchase Price shall be increased by fifty-one percent (51%) of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the Actual Average Daily NOI
exceeds the Estimated Average Daily NOI, multiplied by (B) the number of days
following the Balance Sheet Date up to but not including the Closing Date.

(iv) If the Estimated Average Daily NOI exceeds the Actual Average Daily NOI,
the Purchase Price shall be decreased by fifty-one percent (51%) of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the amount by which the Estimated Average Daily
NOI exceeds the Actual Average Daily NOI, multiplied by (B) the number of days
following the Balance Sheet Date up to but not including the Closing Date.

To the extent the Purchase Price is increased pursuant to this Section 3.4(d),
Purchasers shall pay to Sellers such amount by wire transfer or delivery of
other immediately available funds, within three (3) business days after the
later of (i) final determination of such increase and (ii) the date Sellers
provide notice to Purchasers of wire transfer instructions. To the extent the
Purchase Price is decreased pursuant to this Section 3.4(d), Sellers shall pay
to Purchasers such amount by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
available funds, within three (3) business days after the later of (i) final
determination of such decrease and (ii) the date Purchasers provide notice to
Sellers of wire transfer instructions. The provisions of this Section 3.4
shall survive Closing.

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, all
closing costs, including any Transfer Taxes (as defined in the MTCA), shall be

for the tail insurance policy or endorsement covering general liability and
professional liability at each Facility for applicable statute of limitations
period as required to be obtained under each OTA, shall borne by fifty-one
percent (51%) by Sellers and forty-nine percent (49%) by Purchasers.

2.5, Section 3.4(d) or Section 3.5 or (2) to Losses from the breach by Sellers
of the Fundamental Seller Representations and such Losses shall be excluded
from the aggregate Losses in applying the Sellers Cap to such aggregate
Losses. [***].

4.4 Representations and Warranties of Purchasers. Purchasers hereby make the
following representations and warranties to Sellers:

(a) Organization and Authority. Each Purchaser is duly incorporated or
organized, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing as a
corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, under the laws of
Delaware. Each Purchaser has the full right, power and 

authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate or cause to be
consummated on its behalf the transactions contemplated herein. The person
signing this Agreement on behalf of each Purchaser is authorized to do so.
This Agreement has been, and all of the documents to be delivered at the
Closing will be, duly authorized and properly executed by each Purchaser and
constitute, or will constitute, as appropriate, the valid and binding
obligation of each Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights and by
general principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

(b) No Violations. Assuming the making of all filings or notices and receipt
of all consents referenced in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 4.4(c),
neither the execution and delivery by each Purchaser of this Agreement and the
other closing documents to be executed and delivered by each Purchaser nor the
performance by each Purchaser of its duties and obligations under this
Agreement and such closing documents will cause or result in a violation of
(i) any contract, agreement or other instrument to which such Purchaser is a
party or by which any of its respective assets are bound, (ii) any law,
judicial order or judgment of any nature by which such Purchaser is bound, or
(iii) the organizational documents of such Purchaser, except, in the case of
clause (i) or (ii) above, to the extent any of the foregoing, individually or
in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the ability of
such Purchaser to carry out its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

(c) Consents; Governmental Approvals. Except for consents, filings or notices
which are (i) set forth on Schedule 4.1(c), (ii) Required Governmental
Approvals or (iii) required as a result of facts or circumstances relating to
the identity of either Seller or its affiliates, and subject to Section 9.18,
no consent from, filing with, or notice to, any federal, state or local court
or federal, state or local government bureau, department, commission or
agency, or any other person or entity whether or not governmental in
character, is required to permit either Purchaser to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(d) Financial Ability. Purchasers have, and will have at the Closing, cash on
hand or undrawn amounts immediately available under existing credit facilities
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (a) paying the Purchase Price at Closing and (b) paying all related
fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchasers pursuant to this
Agreement. Neither Purchaser has incurred any obligation, commitment,
restriction or liability of any kind, or is contemplating or aware of any
obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, in either case
which would reasonably be expected to materially impair or adversely affect
such resources.

(e) OFAC. Each Purchaser and, to Purchasers' Knowledge, each person or entity
owning a (direct or indirect) interest in either Purchaser (i) is not
currently identified on the List, and (ii) is not a person or entity with whom
a citizen of the United States is prohibited to engage in transactions by any
trade embargo, economic sanction, or other prohibition of United States law,
regulation, or Executive Order of the President of the United States, and
(iii) is not an Embargoed Person; provided that the foregoing representations
shall not apply with respect to any person or entity owning a (direct or
indirect) interest in HCP. To Purchasers' Knowledge, none of 

the funds or other assets of Purchasers constitute property of, or are owned
directly or indirectly by, any Embargoed Person; provided that the foregoing
representation shall not apply with respect to any person or entity owning a
(direct or indirect) interest in HCP. To Purchasers' Knowledge, no Embargoed
Person has any (direct or indirect) interest of any nature whatsoever in
Purchasers; provided that the foregoing representation shall not apply with
respect to any person or entity owning a (direct or indirect) interest in HCP.

The provisions of this Section 4.4 shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months, except the provisions of Section 4.4(a) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Purchasers Representations"), which shall survive the Closing for
the applicable statute of limitations periods.

4.5 Purchasers' Knowledge Defined. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Purchasers' Knowledge" means the actual (not constructive or imputed)
knowledge of [***]. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly understood and
agreed that none of such persons will have any personal liability under this
Agreement on account of the representations and warranties set forth herein or
otherwise.

4.6 Purchasers' Indemnification. If the Closing occurs, Purchasers and HCP
(jointly and severally) hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers, their affiliates, and the respective officers, directors,
shareholders, partners, members and employees of the foregoing (collectively,
"Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses which they
incur by reason of, or in connection with, any breach by Purchasers of any of
their covenants or representations or warranties set forth herein. No Seller
Indemnified Party may pursue Purchasers for indemnification as a result of any
breach of a covenant that, to Sellers' Knowledge, occurred prior to Closing.
The provisions of this Section 4.6 shall survive the Closing for a period of
[***], except with respect to (x) any indemnification for claims of which
Sellers shall have given written notice to Purchasers prior to the expiration
of such [***] period and (y) any indemnification in connection with the
Fundamental Purchasers Representations (which shall survive the Closing for
the applicable statute of limitations periods). No claims may be asserted by
any Seller Indemnified Party against Purchasers for any breach of any
covenants or representations or warranties set forth herein unless and until
the Losses under all of such claims exceed [***] in the aggregate, in which
case the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover Losses only
in excess of such amount, and Purchasers' liability for such claims shall not
exceed [***] in the aggregate, except that the foregoing shall not apply (1)
to any amounts owing by Purchasers to Sellers pursuant to Section 2.3, Section
2.5, Section 3.4(d) or Section 3.5 or (2) to Losses from the breach by
Purchasers of the Fundamental Purchasers Representations and such Losses shall
be excluded from the aggregate Losses in applying the foregoing cap to such
aggregate Losses. [***].

Agreement without first obtaining the other party's consent to such

9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits and
all documents delivered at Closing pursuant hereto, the MTCA, the OTAs and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 3, 2019, by and between
Brookdale and HCP contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and fully supersede all prior written
or oral agreements and understandings between the parties hereto pertaining to

this Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of the MTCA, the terms of the MTCA shall govern and control.

9.8 Further Assurances. Each party hereto agrees that it will, without further
consideration, execute and deliver such other documents and take such other
action subsequent to Closing as may be reasonably requested by any other party
hereto to consummate more effectively the purposes or subject matter of this
Agreement. The provisions of this Section 9.8 shall survive Closing.

9.9 Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and all such executed counterparts shall constitute the same
agreement. Signatures to this Agreement, any amendment hereof, and any notice
given hereunder, executed and transmitted by facsimile (or by copies of
physically signed documents exchanged via e-mail attachments in PDF or an
equivalent format) shall be valid and effective to bind the party so signing.

9.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

9.11 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT IS PERFORMABLE IN THE STATE

EITHER PARTY, CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD
AND DETERMINED IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
PURCHASERS AND SELLERS AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.11 SHALL

CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

documents to be executed and delivered at Closing are and will be for the
benefit of Sellers and Purchasers only and are not for the benefit of any
third party (including, without limitation, any broker), and, accordingly, no
third party shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement
(other than Seller Indemnified Parties or Purchasers' Indemnified Parties, to
the extent provided herein) or of the documents to be executed and delivered
at Closing (except as otherwise expressly provided therein). The provisions of
this Section 9.12 shall survive the Closing.

convenience of reference only and are not intended, to any extent and for any
purpose, to limit or define the text of any section or any subsection hereof.

9.14 Construction. The parties hereto acknowledge that the parties and their
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement
or any exhibits or schedules hereto.

9.15 No Implied Waivers. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder, and no course of
dealing between or among the parties hereto, shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

9.16 Public Announcements. Section 5.8 of the MTCA shall apply to this
Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

warranties of Purchasers under this Agreement and any document delivered by

Section 201 of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15
U.S.C. Section 18a, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("HSR
Act"). In making such determination, neither Sellers nor Purchasers did or
will rely upon any written or oral statement, representation or warranty made
by or on behalf of another party, whether or not contained in this Agreement,
as to the applicability of the HSR Act to the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

9.19 Effective Time. This Agreement shall be effective as of 12:00:01 a.m.,
Eastern Time, on October 1, 2019.

affiliates may consummate the acquisition of the PropCo JV Interest (or any
portion thereof) as part of a so-called like-kind exchange (an "Exchange")
pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code; provided, however, that: (i) neither the
Closing nor any other date contemplated by this Agreement shall be delayed or
affected by reason of the Exchange nor shall the consummation or
accomplishment of an Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent
to Purchasers\' obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Sellers shall not be
required to take an assignment of any agreement for the relinquished or
replacement property or be required to acquire or hold title to any real
property for purposes of consummating an Exchange; (iii) Purchasers shall pay
all out-of-pocket costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by Sellers
had PropCo Purchaser not consummated the transaction through an Exchange; (iv)
Sellers shall not incur any additional liabilities on account of the Exchange;
(v) Sellers\' rights pursuant to this Agreement shall not be reduced, and
Sellers\' liabilities and obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall not be
increased, by reason of this Section 9.20; (vi) any representations,
covenants, indemnities, agreements, and obligations of Purchasers pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be diminished or otherwise effected, and any rights
of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall not be impaired, due to such
Exchange; and (vii) Sellers make no representation or warranty to Purchasers
concerning the tax treatment of such exchange and shall have no liability for
any failure of such exchange to qualify under Section 1031 of the Code.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.20, Sellers and their affiliates
shall cooperate with PropCo Purchaser, HCP and its affiliates in effecting an
Exchange with respect to the PropCo JV Interest (or any portion thereof).

9.21 Books and Records. On the Closing Date (or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter), Sellers shall furnish to Purchasers all books and
records in Sellers' or their affiliates' possession or reasonable control
which relate to the JV Interests, the JV Entities, the JV Subs and the
Facilities (but expressly excluding documents and other materials which
constitute only Sellers' or its affiliates' (other than the JV Subs and the JV
Entities) internal financial analyses, appraisals, income tax returns,
Seller's corporate or other entity governance records, and any work papers,
memoranda, analysis, correspondence and similar documents and materials
prepared by or for any Seller or its affiliates in connection with the
