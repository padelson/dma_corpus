PURCHASE AND SALE 

2.1. Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell,
transfer, assign and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller,
the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens. The purchase and sale
of the Membership Interests is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Acquisition".

2.2. Seller Documents, Fannie Consent.

(a) Prior to Closing, Seller agrees to make available to Buyer all relevant
documents, books, records, agreements, and information relating to the Company
and/or the Properties that are in Seller's possession or control and are
reasonably requested by Buyer for inspection, audit and review, including,
without limitation, the "Seller Documents" described on Schedule 2.2 hereof.

(b) In accordance with and pursuant to the requirements of the documents
evidencing, governing and securing the Fannie Loans (the "Fannie Loan
Documents"), Buyer intends to seek the consent of Fannie to the Acquisition
with the Fannie Loans remaining in place. Buyer shall have until September 30,
2013 (the "Fannie Consent Period") to obtain and deliver to Seller evidence
that Fannie has consented to the Acquisition at Closing with the Fannie Loan
Documents remaining in effect under the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Fannie Loan Documents (the "Fannie Consent"). The Fannie Consent will
be evidenced by an Assumption and Release Agreement in form mutually agreed to
by Fannie, Buyer and Seller with respect to each of the Fannie Loans
(collectively, the "Loan Assumption Agreements"), which Loan Assumption
Agreements must include a release, from and after Closing, of all existing
guarantors from any obligations and liabilities under any and all non-recourse
carveout guaranties, environmental guaranties or other guaranties of any kind
whatsoever executed by such existing guarantors in favor of Fannie
("Releases"). Prior to the Effective Date, Buyer has submitted formal
applications to Fannie for the Fannie Consent (including the Releases). From
and after the Effective Date, Buyer shall exercise commercially reasonable and
diligent efforts to obtain such consents and to negotiate and agree upon the
form of the Loan Assumption Agreements, and Seller agrees to cooperate with
Buyer with respect to Buyer's efforts to obtain the Fannie Consent and to
negotiate and agree upon the form of the Loan Assumption Agreements (including
the Releases), but Seller shall not be obligated to spend money or incur any
new liability or retain any existing liability in order to facilitate Buyer's
efforts to obtain the Fannie Consent or the Loan Assumption Agreements
(including the Releases). Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably advised as to the
status of Buyer's efforts to obtain the Fannie Consent. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall notify Seller on or before June 20, 2013 if Buyer does
not reasonably expect to obtain the Fannie Consent prior to June 30, 2013. If,
after the exercise of commercially reasonable and diligent efforts, Buyer
fails to obtain the Fannie Consent and/or if Buyer, Seller and Fannie fail to
agree upon and execute the Loan Assumption Agreements within the Fannie
Consent Period, then Buyer or Seller shall each be entitled to terminate this
Agreement by giving notice of termination to the other party at any time prior
to the date the Fannie Consent is obtained, whereupon the Deposit (as
hereinafter defined) shall be returned to Buyer, and neither party shall have
any further rights or obligations hereunder, except for those rights and
obligations that are specifically identified as surviving the termination of
this Agreement. Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with
obtaining the Fannie Consent 

and the Loan Assumption Agreements (including the Releases), including, but
not limited to, any consent fee imposed by Fannie and Fannie's attorneys'
fees.

2.3. Closing Date. The closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing") shall take

(ii) five (5) business days following the date Buyer, Seller and Fannie
indicate that they have agreed upon the form of the Loan Assumption Agreements
and are ready and willing to execute the same upon the satisfaction of all
other conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII, unless another time,
date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date upon which
the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date".

2.4. Consideration. The Purchase Price shall be $122,750,000.00, subject to
allocations, credits and adjustments described herein. The Purchase Price
shall be paid as follows:

(a) Buyer shall receive a credit for the total outstanding balance of all
principal and accrued interest with respect to the Fannie Loans.

(b) If any Tenant shall have paid to the Company the rent due under such
Tenant's Lease for the month in which the Closing occurs, then Buyer shall
receive a credit at Closing equal to the portion of such rent that is
allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date. If any Tenant shall
not have paid to the Company the rent due under such Tenant's Lease for the
month in which the Closing occurs, then the Purchase Price shall be increased
by an amount equal to the portion of such rent that is allocable to the period
preceding the Closing Date.

(c) Buyer shall pay the balance of the Purchase Price by in cash by wire
transfer.

(d) Buyer has previously delivered to First American Title Insurance Company,
as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), an earnest money deposit in the amount of
$613,750.00 ("Deposit") in connection with the March 14, 2013 letter of
intent. Seller agrees to instruct Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer
at Closing, unless Buyer elects to apply the same to the Purchase Price (in
which event Buyer shall instruct Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Seller
at Closing). The parties have executed the April 2, 2013 escrow letter
agreement ("Escrow Agreement") which is incorporated herein by reference.

(e) In the event the Company or Seller holds any security deposits or escrow
funds of the Tenant Parties pursuant to the terms of the Leases and such funds
are held by the Company or Seller in an account that is a part of the Excluded
Assets, then Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the Company to transfer,
the balance of such security deposits or escrow funds to an account designated

the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(ii)(A) shall

(n) The obligation to pay or otherwise satisfy any Excluded Liability or the
obligation to pay Taxes allocable to the party in question pursuant to Section

(o) The period for which a representation or warranty, covenant or agreement
survives the Closing is referred to herein as the "Applicable Survival
Period." In the event a Notice of Claim for indemnification under Section 10.2
is given within the Applicable Survival Period, the representation or
warranty, covenant or agreement that is the subject of such indemnification
claim (whether or not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon
such claim) shall survive with respect to such claim until such claim is
finally resolved. The Indemnitor shall indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses
(subject to the limitations set forth herein, if applicable) that the
Indemnitee may incur in respect of such claim, regardless of when incurred.

10.2. Indemnification by Seller and the Company.

(c) Seller (and, prior to the Closing, the Company) shall indemnify and defend
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company) and
their respective stockholders, members, managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Buyer Indemnitees") against,
and shall hold them harmless from, any and all losses, damages, claims
(including third party claims), charges, interest, penalties, Taxes,
diminution in value, costs and expenses (including legal, consultant,
accounting and other professional fees, costs of sampling, testing,
investigation, removal, treatment and remediation of contamination and fees
and costs incurred in enforcing rights under this Section 10.2) (collectively,
"Losses") resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee
in connection with, or otherwise with respect to: 

(v) the failure of any representation and warranty or other statement by
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
executed by Seller or the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be true and correct in all respects as of
the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date;

(vi) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller or the Company
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement executed by Seller or
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

(vii) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller or the
Company to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person
retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

(viii) any failure to pay or otherwise satisfy any Excluded Liability;

provided that this Section 10.2 shall not apply with respect to any Loss
relating to Taxes to the extent that indemnification payments for such Loss
have been made pursuant to Section 10.7. Any and all Losses hereunder shall
bear interest from the date incurred until paid at the rate of 8% per annum.

10.3. Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims.

(j) In the event that Buyer ("Indemnitee" for purposes of this Section)
receives notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
Proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
the provisions of this Article X ("Third Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing ("Notice of Claim") of such Third
Party Claim. Failure or delay in notifying the Indemnitor will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any liability it may have to the Indemnitee, except and only to
the extent that such failure or delay causes actual harm to the Indemnitor
with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Notice of Claim shall set forth
the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate of the foreseeable maximum
amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such Losses) and a description of the basis for such Third Party
Claim.

(k) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 10.3, the Indemnitor
will have ten (10) days (or less if the nature of the Third Party Claim
requires) from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Notice of Claim
to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will assume the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom
with counsel of its choice (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) and at
its sole cost and expense (a "Third Party Defense"); provided, however, that
if the Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance with the
foregoing, Indemnitor shall nonetheless have the right to discontinue such
Third Party Defense if Indemnitor later in good faith determines that such
Third Party Claim is not within the scope of its indemnity obligation
hereunder and provides Indemnitee with written notice of such determination
and a reasonably detailed explanation setting forth the basis of its
conclusion. Any Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such Third Party Defense and to participate therein, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnitor unless
the applicable 

Third Party Claim is properly within the scope of Indemnitor's indemnity
obligation under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 above and (a) the Indemnitor shall
have failed, within the time after having been notified by the Indemnitee of
the existence of the Third Party Claim as provided in the first sentence of
this paragraph (b), to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, (c) the
Indemnitor shall have improperly discontinued its Third Party Defense pursuant
to the foregoing provisions, or (d) the employment of such counsel at
Indemnitor's cost has been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnitor, which authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(l) The Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if:

(i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief;

(ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;

(iii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
Environmental Action or actions with respect to intellectual property;

(iv) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue exists between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in respect
of the Third Party Claim;

(v) the Indemnitee reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect
to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to or injure the Indemnitee's
reputation or future business prospects;

(vi) the Indemnitor has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such Third Party Claim; or

(vii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnitee
of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third Party Defense and provide
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

(m) If by reason of the Third Party Claim a Lien, attachment, garnishment or
execution is placed upon any of the property or assets of the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitor, if it desires to exercise its right to assume such Third Party
Defense, must furnish a satisfactory indemnity bond or other security
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, in its sole but reasonable discretion, to
obtain the prompt release of such Lien, attachment, garnishment or execution.

(n) If the Indemnitor assumes a Third Party Defense and unless and until
Indemnitor elects to discontinue such Third Party Defense, it will take all
steps necessary in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such claim or
litigation and will hold all Indemnitees harmless from and against all Losses
caused by or arising out of such Third Party Claim to the extent such Third
Party Claim is properly within the scope of the Indemnitor's indemnity
obligations under this Article X. The Indemnitor will not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the written consent
of the Indemnitee (which consent 

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the
consent of the Indemnitee shall not be required if all of the following
conditions are met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnitees by the
third party of a release of the Indemnitees from all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) there is no finding or admission of (a) any
violation of Law by the Indemnitees (or any Affiliate thereof), (b) any
violation of the rights of any Person and (c) no effect on any other
Proceeding or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the
Indemnitees (or any Affiliate thereof), and (iii) the sole form of relief is
monetary damages which are paid in full by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor
shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently,
and the Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the
Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim, provided that in such
event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for
such claim unless the Indemnitor shall have consented to such payment or
settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
agreed to indemnify Indemnitee therefor. If the Indemnitor is not reasonably
conducting the Third Party Defense in good faith and Indemnitee gives notice
of such failure to Indemnitor and the same continues for beyond a reasonable
period of time for Indemnitor to cure such behavior, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee promptly for all
Losses incurred in connection with such judgment or settlement to the extent
the applicable Third Party Claim is properly within the scope of Indemnitor's
indemnity obligations under this Article X.

(o) In the event that (i) an Indemnitee gives Notice of Claim to the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor fails or elects not to assume a Third Party
Defense which the Indemnitor had the right to assume under this Section 10.3,
(ii) the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume the Third Party Defense pursuant
to this Section 10.3, or (iii) the Indemnitor assumes such Third Party Defense
but later elects to discontinue such Third Party Defense, the Indemnitee shall
have the right, with counsel of its choice, to defend, conduct and control the
Third Party Defense, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor (in the
event such Third Party Defense is properly within the scope of Indemnitor's
indemnity obligations under this Article X). In each case, the Indemnitee
shall conduct the Third Party Defense actively and diligently, and the
Indemnitor will provide reasonable cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim on such terms
as it may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the amount of any
settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the Indemnitee
without the consent of the Indemnitor shall not be determinative of the
validity of the claim, except with the consent of the Indemnitor (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding Section 11.6 hereof, in
connection with any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor hereby consents to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding in respect of a
Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnitee for purposes of any claim
that the Indemnitee may have under this Article X with respect to such
Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and 

agrees that process may be served on the Indemnitor with respect to such a
claim anywhere in the world. If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume a
Third Party Defense which it has the right to assume hereunder, the Indemnitee
shall have no obligation to do so.

(p) Each party to this Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate and to cause its employees to cooperate with and assist the
Indemnitee or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, in connection with any Third
Party Defense, including attending conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals and furnishing records, information and
testimony, as may reasonably be requested; provided that each party shall use
its best efforts, in respect of any Third Party Claim of which it has assumed
the defense, to preserve the confidentiality of all confidential information
and the attorney-client and work-product privileges.

10.4. Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. In the event of a
claim for which the Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of this Article X that does not involve a Third Party Claim
being asserted against it, the Indemnitee shall send a Notice of Claim to the
Indemnitor. The Notice of Claim shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if
not known, an estimate of the foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Losses)
and a description of the basis for such claim. The Indemnitor will have thirty
(30) days from receipt of such Notice of Claim to provide written notice to
Indemnitee that it disputes the claim. If Indemnitor does not dispute the
claim and if the amount of the Losses is known and not disputed, the amount of
such Losses will be immediately due and payable from Indemnitor to Indemnitee.

10.5. [INTENTIONALLY DELETED].

10.6. No Contribution. Seller acknowledges and agrees that, upon and following
the Closing, the Company shall not have any liability or obligation to
indemnify, save or hold harmless or otherwise pay, reimburse or make Seller
whole for or on account of any indemnification or other claims made by any
Buyer Indemnitee hereunder. Seller shall have no right of contribution against
the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to any such indemnification
or other claim.

10.7. Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall be
responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Tax Indemnitee against, and reimburse such Tax
Indemnitee for any Taxes that are an obligation of Seller pursuant to Section
7.3(a).

10.8. Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

(a) If any Taxing Authority or other Person asserts a Tax Claim, then the
party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice of such Tax Claim to the other party hereto; provided that the
failure of Buyer to give such prompt notice to Seller of any such Tax Claim
shall not relieve Seller of any of its obligations under this Section 10.8
unless Seller is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of any
relevant correspondence received from the Taxing Authority or other Person. 

(b) Seller shall have the right to defend or prosecute, at its sole cost,
expense and risk, only those Tax Claims with respect to Taxes for which it is
responsible as set forth in Section 10.7. In order to defend or prosecute any
