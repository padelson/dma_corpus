and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as such terms are defined in, and as
required by, Rules&nbsp;13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
<B>&#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;</B>). The Company&#146;s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the Company&#146;s independent
registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation
report concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. Since December&nbsp;31, 2006 and through the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no events, facts or circumstances have occurred, or exist, such that management would
not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s system of internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, and conclude, after such
assessment, that such controls were effective. The principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has established and maintains and adheres to and enforces in all material respects a
system of internal control over financial reporting, which is sufficient in all material respects
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements (including the Company Financials) for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. To the Knowledge of the Company, since the date of the Company&#146;s most recent
Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any
Employee), nor the Company&#146;s independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (A)&nbsp;any

preparation of financial statements (including the Parent Financials) for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. To the Knowledge of Parent, since the date of Parent&#146;s most recent Form 10-Q
