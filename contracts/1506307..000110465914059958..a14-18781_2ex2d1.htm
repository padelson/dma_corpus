ARTICLE II

 



 

 _EFFECT ON UNITS_

 



 

Section 2.1. _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Partnership, the Partnership
GP, the Partnership GP Delegate, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any
securities of the Partnership or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section _ _2.1(c)_ , _Section
_ _2.2(h)_ and _Section 2.5_, each Common Unit issued and outstanding or
deemed issued and outstanding in accordance with _Section _ _2.4_ as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right, at
the election of the holder of such Common Unit pursuant to _Section _ _2.3_ ,
to receive any of the following consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_
"):

 



 

(i) _Mixed Election Units_. Each Common Unit with respect to which an election
to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been
properly made and not properly revoked pursuant to _Section _ _2.3_ (each, a
" _Mixed Consideration Election Unit_ ") and each No Election Unit (as that
term is defined in _Section _ _2.3(b)_ ) shall be converted into the right to
receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Per Unit Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $10.77 in cash without interest
(the " _Per Unit Mixed Consideration Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 2.1931 shares of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Class P Stock (such number
of shares, the " _Per Unit Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), in each
case, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section _ _2.5_.

 



 

(ii) _Cash Election Units_. Each Common Unit with respect to which an election
to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly made and not
properly revoked pursuant to _Section _ _2.3_ (each, a " _Cash Election Unit_
") shall be converted (provided that the Available Cash Election Amount (as
defined below) equals or exceeds

 



      
 

 



 

the Cash Election Amount (as defined below)) into the right to receive $91.72
in cash without interest (the " _Per Unit Cash Election Consideration_ "),
subject to adjustment in accordance with this _Section _ _2.2(c)(ii)_ and
_Section _ _2.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) the product of the
number of Cash Election Units and the Per Unit Cash Election Consideration
(such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) the difference
between (x) the product of the Per Unit Mixed Consideration Cash Amount and _
_ the total number of issued and outstanding Common Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding Common Units that are to remain outstanding as
provided for in _Section 2.1(c)_ and including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Common Units deemed outstanding pursuant to _Section 2.4_) minus (y) the
product of the number of Mixed Consideration Election Units (provided that No
Election Units shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Units for
purposes of this _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_) and the Per Unit Mixed Consideration
Cash Amount (the " _Aggregate Mixed Consideration Cash Amount_ ") (such
difference being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each Cash
Election Unit shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Unit Cash Election
Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Class P Stock
equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash
Fraction.

 



 

(iii) _Stock Election Units_. Each Common Unit with respect to which an
election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been
properly made and not properly revoked pursuant to _Section _ _2.3_ (each, a
" _Stock Election Unit_ ") shall be converted (provided that the Cash Election
Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into the right
to receive 2.4849 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Class P Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in
accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section _ _2.5_ (the " _Per
Unit Stock Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available
Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock
Election Unit shall be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the
number of Stock Election Units and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Parent Class P Stock equal to the product of (x)
the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Unit Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (A) of
this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ and the denominator of which shall be the Per Unit
Cash Election Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The membership interests in Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a
number of Common Units of the Surviving Entity equal to the number of Common
Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section _ _2.1(a)_. At the Effective Time, the books and records of the
Partnership shall be revised to reflect the conversion of all Common Units
held by Persons other than the Partnership GP, the Partnership GP Delegate,
Parent and any Subsidiaries of Parent, and the Partnership GP, the Partnership
GP Delegate, Parent and any

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries of Parent shall continue the existence of the Partnership (as the
Surviving Entity) without dissolution.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Partnership-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Partnership
Interests_. Any Units that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Partnership shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled Units.
All Partnership Interests, including the Partnership GP Interest, that are
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Partnership GP, the
Partnership GP Delegate, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall remain
outstanding as Partnership Interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by
the Merger.

 



 

(d) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section _ _2.1(a)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-
certificated Common Units represented in book-entry form immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.2(g)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_, in each case to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_, without interest.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units for
the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than five (5) business days following the Effective Time, Parent will
send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of
Common Units as of the Effective Time whose Common Units were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and, to the extent commercially
practicable, to make available for collection by hand, during customary
business hours commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if so elected
by such holder of record), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that,
with respect to certificated Common Units, the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section _
_2.2(i)_ ) to the Exchange Agent) in such customary forms as the Partnership
and Parent may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time, including, as
applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section _
_2.2(i)_ ) and Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 2.2(h)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section
_ _2.2(g)_.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units whose Common Units are converting into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, shares of Parent Class P Stock (which
shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a

 



       
 

 



 

physical certificate is specifically requested, following the Effective Time,
by the holder of such shares of Parent Class P Stock) and an amount of cash in
U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section _ _2.1_ ,
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common
Units) or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars or other
consideration as applicable sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ and any shares of Parent Class P
Stock or cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any Merger Consideration, in
each case, that may be payable from time to time following the Effective Time.
All cash and book-entry shares representing Parent Class P Stock and any
dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(g)_ deposited with
the Exchange Agent or representing unit proceeds obtained pursuant to _Section
_ _2.2(h)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions delivered by
Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article _ _II_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
to pay such Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section _2.2(h)_ and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon delivery to the Exchange Agent
of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section _2.2(i)_ ) with respect
to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry Units and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent (including with respect to
Book-Entry Units), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the
number of shares of Parent Class P Stock (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is specifically requested,
following the Effective Time, by the holder of such shares of Parent Class P
Stock) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent
Class P Stock that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article _ _II_ , (ii) a check denominated in U.S. dollars
in the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Article _ _II_ (including any cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(h)_ ) and (iii) such dividends or other
distributions as such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section _
_2.2(g)_. The Merger Consideration and such other amounts as reflected in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be paid as promptly as practicable after
receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common
Units) or any applicable documentation with respect to the surrender of Book-
Entry Units and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Units. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate and Book-Entry Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and such
other amount as contemplated by _Section _ _2.2(g)_.

 



 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person
requesting such payment shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of
such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the
name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall be a
condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of Common
Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units
representing Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Units are presented to the Exchange
Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
_Article _ _II_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged his, her or its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Partnership shall not be liable to any holder of Common Units for any
Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by holders of Common Units immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Class P Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Units until such
Certificates or Book-Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section
2.2_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of
the shares of Parent Class P Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at
the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in
respect of any such shares of Parent Class P Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Class P Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. For

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Class P Stock, all shares of Parent Class P Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Class P Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of Common Units converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class P Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to _Section _ _2.2(i)_ ) or Book-Entry Units to be delivered
by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2(h)_, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of such fractional shares representing such holders
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by reasonable and customary fees of the Exchange Agent
attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the " _share proceeds_ ") in one or
more transactions of a number of shares of Parent Class P Stock, such number
equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Class P
Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Class P Stock
to be distributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Units pursuant
to _Section 2.2(c)_ (such excess being, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash share proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Common
Units that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Class P Stock,
shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE in the
manner provided in this _Section 2.2(h)_ and shall execute such sales in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the share proceeds of such sale or
sales have been distributed to the holders of such Common Units, or the
Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such share proceeds
in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Common Units (the "
_Fractional Share Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion
of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each holder of such Common Units
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate share
proceeds comprising the Fractional Share Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount of the fractional shares to which such holder of such
Common Units would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional shares to which all holders of such Common
Units would otherwise be entitled. To the extent applicable, each holder of
Common Units shall be deemed to have consented for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or local income tax purposes) to
report the cash received for fractional shares in the Merger as a sale of a
portion of the holders Common Units to Parent.

 



 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange

 



      
 

 



 

for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Common Units represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this _Article _ _II_ and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section _ _2.2_ _(g)_.

 



 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is
required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in cash or Parent
Class P Stock, as determined by Parent). To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of the Common Units in respect of whom such withholding was
made. If withholding is taken in shares of Parent Class P Stock, Parent and
the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing
authority.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Election Form_. An election form and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify with respect to certificated Common
Units that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall reasonably specify and as shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be
mailed no less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or
on such other date as Parent and the Partnership shall mutually agree (the "
_Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Common Units as of the close of
business on the fifth business day prior to the Mailing Date or such other
date as mutually agreed to by Parent and the Partnership (the " _Election Form
Record Date_").

 



 

(b) _Choice of Election_. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the
beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to specify (i) the number of such holders (or such beneficial
owners) Common Units with respect to which such holder (or such beneficial
owner) elects to receive (A) the Per Unit Mixed Consideration, (B) the Per
Unit Stock Consideration or (C) the Per Unit Cash Election Consideration or
(ii) that such holder (or such beneficial owner) makes no election with
respect to such holders (or such beneficial owners) Common Units. Any Common
Units with respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive a properly
completed Election Form during the period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the
Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the second (2nd) business day
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to
be No Election Units. Parent shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least five (5) business days prior to the Election Deadline. If
the Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline
shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the second
(2nd) business day prior to the Effective Time or such other date as mutually
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership), and Parent shall promptly announce
any such delay

 



      
 

 



 

and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. For the purposes of
this Agreement, " _No Election Unit_ " means each Common Unit for which no
election to receive Per Unit Mixed Consideration, Per Unit Cash Election
Consideration or Per Unit Stock Consideration has been properly made and
received in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.3_. For the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 2.3_, references to Common
Units shall include, or be deemed to include, Restricted Units.

 



 

(c) _New Holders_. Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as
may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become
holders or beneficial owners of Common Units during the Election Period, and
the Partnership shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform its duties as specified herein.

 



 

(d) _Revocations; Exchange Agent_. Any election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form during the Election Period. After a Cash Election, a Stock
Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any Common Units,
any subsequent transfer of such Common Units shall automatically revoke such
election. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting
it by written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election
Period. In the event an Election Form is revoked, the Common Units represented
by such Election Form shall be deemed to be No Election Units, except to the
extent a subsequent election is properly made during the Election Period.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of
Parent or the Partnership or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation
to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Treatment of Restricted Units; Termination of Partnership Equity
Plan_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the GP Delegate Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Partnership Equity Plan) will
adopt resolutions, and the Partnership will take all other actions as may be
necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and the Partnership
Equity Plan (including, the award agreements in respect of awards granted
thereunder) to give effect to this _Section 2.4_ to provide that each Common
Unit subject to forfeiture or restricted unit granted under the Partnership
Equity Plan (each, a " _Restricted Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full and the
restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and each Restricted Unit shall
be treated as an issued and outstanding Common Unit as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including _Section _ _2.1,_ _Section _ _2.2_ and Section _2.3_
).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership GP Delegate shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Partnership Equity Plan, such termination
to be effective at the Effective Time, and from and after the Effective Time,
the Partnership Equity Plan shall be

 



      
 

 



 

terminated and no Restricted Units or other rights with respect to Common
Units or other Partnership Interests shall be granted or be outstanding
thereunder, it being understood that the terminations contemplated by this
Agreement shall in no respect limit Parents obligations under this _Section
2.4 _with respect to Restricted Units granted prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article _
_II_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the number of outstanding Common Units or shares of Parent Class P Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of units or shares or a
different class or series by reason of the occurrence or record date of any
unit or share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit or share distribution, combination, exchange of units or
shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration, the Per Unit Mixed
Consideration Cash Amount, the Per Unit Cash Election Consideration, the Per
Unit Stock Consideration, the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio and any
other similar dependent item, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit or share dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit or
share distribution, combination, exchange of units or shares or similar
transaction and to provide the holders of Common Units the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

Section 2.6. _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance
or that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be expected to have
a Partnership Material Adverse Effect), the Partnership and, with respect to
themselves where provided for in this _Article _ _III_ , the Partnership GP

is incorporated, formed or organized, as applicable, and has all requisite
limited liability company, corporate, partnership or other applicable entity
power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets

Effect on the Partnership (" _Partnership Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



 

(b) All the outstanding limited liability company interests, partnership
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of the Partnership that are owned directly or indirectly

(a) Each of the Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP
Delegate has all necessary entity power and authority to execute and deliver

Agreement, have been duly authorized and approved by each of the GP Delegate
Board, the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee and the GP Board and, except for

part of the Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms; provided that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws

and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such principles are
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) public policy,
applicable law relating to fiduciary duties and indemnification and an implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Partnership,

properties or assets of, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement,
debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ")
or Permit to which the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or
by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected or (iii) result in the exercisability of any right to purchase or
acquire any material asset of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of clause (ii), for such violations, conflicts, losses,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or Liens that have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except for the approval by the GP Delegate Board, the GP Conflicts and
Audit Committee and the GP Board, which was obtained prior to the execution of
this Agreement, the affirmative vote or consent of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Units at the Partnership Unitholder Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof in favor of the approval of this Agreement (the "
_Partnership Unitholder Approval_ ") is the only vote or approval of the
holders of any class or series of Partnership Interests that is necessary to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

December 31, 2011 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). The Parent SEC Documents,
as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the Parent SEC
Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements
of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the
case of all other Parent SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and
none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last

the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

officer and the chief financial officer of Parent have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to Parent SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. As of the date of this Agreement there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent Parents chief executive officer and chief

pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would
be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance
sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other
than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8. _Compliance With Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2011
and their respective dates of formation or organization have been, in
compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any applicable
Law, except where such non-compliance,

 



      
 

 



 

default or violation has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits necessary for
Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Parent
Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are
in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or threatened in writing,
except where such suspension or cancellation has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and since
December 31, 2011 have not been, in violation or breach of, or default under,
any Parent Permit, except where such violation, breach or default has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
no event or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation
of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an
obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit, or
has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or
refuse to issue, renew or extend any Parent Permit (in each case, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches,
defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries, and, to Parents knowledge, each joint venture partner, joint

(a) The Partnership GP, the Partnership GP Delegate and the Partnership shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective directors, officers, employees,

cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Partnership Alternative
Proposal, request the return or destruction of all confidential information
previously provided to such parties by or on behalf of the Partnership GP, the

if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the Partnership has received a written
Partnership Alternative Proposal that the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee
believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that such Partnership Alternative Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Partnership Superior Proposal

breach of this _Section 5.3_, then the Partnership, the Partnership GP and
the Partnership GP Delegate may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A)
furnish information, including confidential information, with respect to the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Partnership
Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or

 



      
 

 



 

negotiations regarding such Partnership Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that
(x) the Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate will
not, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries, and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective Representatives, not to, disclose any
non-public information to such Person unless the Partnership has, or first
enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality
provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent (other than restrictions related
to the Parents relationship with the Partnership as its indirect general
partner) and (y) the Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP
Delegate will provide to Parent non-public information that was not previously
provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
with providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

the Partnership GP or the Partnership GP Delegate in respect of any
Partnership Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies
of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to
such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep
Parent reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status
and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the
Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received by the
Partnership, the Partnership GP or the Partnership GP Delegate or that the
Partnership, the Partnership GP or the Partnership GP Delegate has delivered
to any third party making a Partnership Alternative Proposal that relate to

discussions or negotiations.

result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding
Common Units or (D) merger, consolidation, unit exchange,

 



      
 

 



 

share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Partnership which is
structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of

outstanding Common Units; in each case, other than the Merger, the KMR Merger
and the EPB Merger.

 



 

(ii) " _Partnership Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written offer,
obtained after the date of this Agreement and not in breach of this _Section
5.3_ (other than an immaterial breach), to acquire, directly or indirectly,

Partnership and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third
party, which is on terms and conditions which the GP Conflicts and Audit
Committee determines in its good faith to be more favorable to the
Partnership, after determining in its good faith that such offer is on terms
and conditions more favorable to the Public Unitholders, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all financial, legal,
financing, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and any changes to the
terms of this Agreement that as of the time of determination had been
committed to by Parent in writing.

 



 

(iii) " _Partnership Intervening Event_ " means a material event or
circumstance that arises or occurs after the date of this Agreement with
respect to the Partnership that was not, prior to the date of this Agreement,
reasonably foreseeable by the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a
Partnership Alternative Proposal or Parent Alternative Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute a Partnership Intervening
Event.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the GP
Delegate Board, the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee or the GP Board from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to a Partnership Alternative Proposal if the GP
Delegate Board, the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee or the GP Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
its failure to do so would not be in the best interests of the Partnership,
after determining that its failure to do so would not be in the best interests
of the Public Unitholders; _provided_ that any Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section _
_5.1(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the

Adverse Recommendation Change.

Committee and which are permitted by Section 5.3 of the KMR Merger Agreement),
and actions by EPB (to the extent taken at the direction of, with the consent

Section 5.3 of the EPB Merger Agreement) shall not breach or violate this
_Section _ _5.4_.

_5.4_ , then Parent may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish

participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Parent Alternative
Proposal; provided that (x) Parent will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective

Delegate non-public information that was not previously provided or made
available to the Partnership, the Partnership GP and the Partnership GP

Partnership, the Partnership GP, the Partnership GP Delegate or any applicable
Subsidiary thereof would be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified Person,
Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to (i) indemnify

Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Partnership, the Partnership
GP and the Partnership GP Delegate than are presently set forth in such
Organizational Documents. Any right of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this

representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or
claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section _ _5.8_
are asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the
Partnership GP and the Partnership GP Delegate, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or

(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _6.3_ _(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent
within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from the
Partnership of such breach or failure; _provided_ that the Partnership shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_ if the Partnership, the Partnership GP or the Partnership GP
Delegate is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void (other than the last sentence of _Section 5.7_, _Section
5.10_, this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and the provisions in _Article
VIII_, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there
shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Partnership, the Partnership GP or the Partnership GP Delegate or their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except that (i) the Partnership
or Parent may have liability as provided in _Section 7.3_, and (ii) nothing
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages for any failure
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement when required pursuant to this Agreement or any party from liability
for fraud or a willful breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ (Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change) or by the Partnership
or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ (Partnership Unitholder Vote), in
each case, where a Partnership Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation Change
has occurred, then the Partnership shall pay to Parent, within two (2)
business days after the date of termination, $817,000,000 (the " _Partnership
Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_ (Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) or by the
Partnership or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iv)_ (Parent Stockholder

date of termination of this Agreement, execute an IDR Waiver in the form
attached to Section 7.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _IDR Waiver_

(d) In the event that the Partnership or Parent, as applicable, shall fail to
pay the Partnership Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such fee shall
accrue interest for the period commencing on the

 



      
 

 



 

date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to the legal rate of interest
provided for in Section 2301 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if
the Partnership or Parent, as applicable, shall fail to pay the Partnership
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, when due, the
Partnership or Parent, as applicable, shall also pay all of the other partys
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with efforts to collect such fee. The parties acknowledge that the
provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, none of the

that the Partnership pays the Partnership Termination Fee to Parent, the

further liability to Parent or Merger Sub of any kind in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that in no
event shall the Partnership be required to pay the Partnership Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. The parties agree that in the event that Parent
pays the Parent Termination Fee to the Partnership through the Partnership

Delegate of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any other party hereto, whether prior to
or after the execution of this Agreement. The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except
as otherwise provided in _Section _ _7.2_ , upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section _ _7.1_ , as the case may be, except that the
agreements set forth in _Article _ _II_ , the last sentence of _Section
5.7_, _Section 5.8_, _Section _ _5.10_ and any other agreement in this
Agreement that contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive
the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 8.2. _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and the
Parent Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by Parents Board of Directors, the GP Delegate
Board and the GP Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP Board and the GP
Delegate Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has first
referred such action to the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee for its
consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee not less
than two (2) business days to make a recommendation to the GP Board and the GP
Delegate Board with respect thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the GP Board
and the GP Delegate Board shall in no way be obligated to follow the
recommendation of the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee and the GP Board and
the GP Delegate Board shall be permitted to take action following the
expiration of such two (2) business day period); _provided_ _,_ _further_ ,
that following receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and Parent
Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
of this Agreement which by Law or

 



      
 

 



 

stock exchange rule would require further approval by the Limited Partners or
the stockholders of Parent, as applicable, without such approval. Unless
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, whenever a determination,
decision, approval or consent of the Partnership, the Partnership GP or the
Partnership GP Delegate is required pursuant to this Agreement, such
determination, decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the GP
Board and the GP Delegate Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP Board
and the GP Delegate Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it
has first referred such action to the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee for its
consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts and Audit Committee not less
than two (2) business days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with
respect thereto.

 



 

Section 8.3. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Partnership, the Partnership GP, the Partnership GP Delegate,
Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 8.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , that if such assignment is to a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company that is created or organized outside the United States and would
result in amounts being deducted or withheld for Taxes pursuant to Section
_2.2(j)_ in excess of the amounts that would have been so deducted or
withheld in the absence of such assignment, then the Merger Consideration
shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made (including any deduction or withholding applicable to additional
sums payable under this _Section _ _8.4_ , the applicable Person receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such assignment been
made). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section shall be null and void.

 



 

Section 8.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof
and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies
hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (b), (i) the provisions of
_Section 5.8_ and Section _8.13_ and (ii) the right of the holders of Common
Units to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim by the
holders of Common Units with respect to which may not be made unless and until
the Closing shall have occurred). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, _Section 8.7_ and _Section 8.13_ shall be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by, any financing sources or lender providing financing in
connection with the Merger.

 



 

Section 8.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware); _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with any debt financing in
connection with the Merger shall be brought only in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under
applicable laws exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section 8.7_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents
to the service of the summons and complaint and any

 



      
 

 



 

other process in any action or proceeding relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by
personal delivery of copies of such process to such party at the addresses set
forth in _Section _ _8.9_. Nothing in this _Section _ _8.7_ shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 8.8. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this _Section
8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate
remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party further agrees that no
party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

 



 

Section 8.9. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) upon personal delivery to the
party to be notified; (b) when received when sent by email or facsimile by the

facsimile shall not be effective unless either (i) a duplicate copy of such
email or fax notice is promptly given by one of the other methods described in
this _Section 8.9_ or (ii) the receiving party delivers a written
