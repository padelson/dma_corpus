 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(as amended, the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue its existence under Delaware law as the
surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a Wholly
Owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four
Times Square, New York, NY 10036, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by law) of such
conditions), or at such other place (or by means of remote communication),
date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such time as is agreed between the Parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided in
Section 259(a) of the DGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated to be in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as
amended, shall be amended in their entirety to read the same as the bylaws of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter
amended as provided therein or in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Company and Parent
shall take all actions necessary to effect any such determination made by
Parent prior to the Effective Time), the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A)
Cancelled Shares or any Dissenting Shares or (B) for the avoidance of doubt,
any Company Restricted Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with
_Section 2.3(b)_) (such shares of Company Common Stock, other than those
contemplated by the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the " _Eligible
Shares_ "), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $12.75
in cash per share of Company Common Stock (such amount in cash per share of
Company Common Stock, without interest, the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates or book-entry accounts representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(iii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, other than, in each case,
shares of Company Common Stock held on behalf of third parties, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 



 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who
has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and
has complied with all the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL concerning the
right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal (the "
_Appraisal Provisions_ ") of their shares of Company Common Stock and has duly
demanded appraisal under the Appraisal Provisions with respect to any issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting
Stockholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), then to the extent the Appraisal
Provisions are applicable, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section
2.1(a)(i)_, but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws or otherwise waives or loses its
demand for appraisal or otherwise fails to perfect its right of appraisal, in
any case pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, each Dissenting Share shall
thereupon be treated as though such share of Company Common Stock had been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and true and
complete copies of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other

 



      
 

 



 

instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent
the opportunity to direct, at Parents expense, all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect thereto, including any determination to make any
payment to any Dissenting Stockholder with respect to any of its Dissenting
Shares under Section 262(h) of the DGCL prior to the entry of judgment in any
such proceedings regarding appraisal. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands or approve, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or securities
or a different class by reason of any stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company (in each case, such acceptance not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) relating to the Paying Agents
responsibilities contemplated by this Agreement (such agreement, the " _Paying
Agent Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock, cash in immediately available funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash amount, the " _Payment Fund_ "). Any
amounts payable in respect of Company Equity Awards shall not be deposited
with Paying Agent but instead be paid through payroll in accordance with
_Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the
third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail or otherwise provide notice to each holder of record of Eligible
Shares that are (i) Certificates or (ii) Book-Entry Shares not held through
DTC, advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice
shall include (A) appropriate transmittal materials (including a letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent (which shall be deemed to have been effected upon
the delivery of a customary

 



      
 

 



 

"agents message" with respect to such Book-Entry Shares or such other
reasonable evidence, if any, of such surrender as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent
Agreement) and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
shall reasonably designate and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates,
as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying
Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to
ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares
held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary
surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-
party intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial owners
thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of Eligible Shares that (i) are Certificates, by physical
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section 2.2(j)_) together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, (ii) are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book-
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the
surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of
surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent
Agreement), in each of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this
_Section 2.2(d)_, pursuant to such materials and instructions as contemplated
by _Section 2.2(c)_, and (iii) are Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, in
accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures and such other procedures
as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, DTC and such other
necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which
the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(i)_). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company
Common Stock may be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or
other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,
no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease
to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement at the
Effective Time upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_, without interest. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. If directed by Parent or as contemplated by
the Paying Agent Agreement, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in
the Payment Fund, if at all, solely in cash or in liquid money market funds
that invest solely in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty days; _provided_ that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_, and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(i)_),
without any interest thereon.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in
accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the holders

 



      
 

 



 

of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any
amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 2.2(g)_, Parent), the posting by such Person of a bond in
a customary form and amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 2.2(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(i)_) in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each award of options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding under the Company
2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Company 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and
accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive,
without interest, a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option as of the Effective Time, __less__ applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration,
payment or right to consideration or payment.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock subject to
vesting, repurchase or other lapse of restrictions (a " _Company Restricted
Share_ ") that is outstanding under the Company Stock Plans as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and

 



      
 

 



 

accelerate in full and become free of restrictions and shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration, __less__ applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding
under the Company Stock Plans as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest and accelerate in full and be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive, without interest, a cash payment in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU Award and (ii) the Merger Consideration, __less__ applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall, through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation, pay or cause to be paid to the holders of the Company
Equity Awards the amounts set forth in this _Section 2.3_ as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date (but no later than the first regularly
schedule payroll date following the Closing Date that is not less than five
Business Days after the Closing Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent that any Company RSU Award constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be
paid at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will
not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent the holder of a Company
Equity Award is not and was not at any time during the applicable vesting
period an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, such amounts shall not
be paid through the payroll system, but shall be paid by the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board of
Directors or the compensation committee of the Company Board of Directors, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.3_; including, without limitation, by
delivering notice of termination to holders of Company Options pursuant to
Section 11.1(c) of the Company 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 8.5_, if at any time
before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes
or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances
are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective officers and directors
shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factors," "forward-
looking statements" or "market risk" sections or in any other section to the
extent they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature); and
provided that any matters disclosed in such forms, documents or reports shall

subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with
respect to any other section or subsection to the extent that the relevance of
any disclosed event, item or occurrence in such section or subsection to such
other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept
is applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed, and has all necessary governmental approvals, to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such approvals, qualification or licensing necessary, except, solely
with respect to the Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so duly
approved, qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement true and complete copies of the Companys Organizational Documents,
and true and complete copies of its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents, in
each case, as amended, restated or amended and restated through the date

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock and Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 135,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share. As of August 15, 2018 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (i)
19,604,095 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, of
which 56,316 shares were Company Restricted Shares, (ii) 0 shares of Company
Common Stock were held in treasury, (iii) 1,119,280 shares of Company Common

234,705 shares were subject to Company RSU Awards, each of which are subject
to only time-based vesting requirements, and (v) no other shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this _Section 3.2(a)_, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, puts, convertible securities, exchangeable securities or
other similar rights, agreements or commitments to which the Company is a

register for sale any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests, (y) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, call, put, convertible securities, exchangeable securities or
other similar right, agreement or commitment relating to the capital stock or
other equity interest of the Company or (z) redeem or otherwise acquire any
such shares of capital stock or other equity interests or (B) granting any
preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect to any security issued by the
Company.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, no Subsidiary of the Company owns any
shares of capital stock of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting or registration of the capital stock or other equity
interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the Capitalization
Date through the date hereof, the Company has not issued or repurchased any
shares of its capital stock (other than in connection with the exercise,
vesting or settlement of Company Equity Awards in accordance with their
respective terms) or granted any Company Equity Awards.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete listing of all outstanding Company Equity Awards as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date, setting forth the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each Company Equity Award and the holder,

and exercise or reference price with respect to each Company Equity Award, as
applicable. Upon any issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stock Plans, such shares of Company Common Stock will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any
preemptive rights. Each Company Option (i) was granted and properly approved
by the Company Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Company
Board of Directors in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms
and conditions of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued, (ii)
has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock equal to or greater

such grant, (iii) has a grant date identical to the date on which the Company
Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Company Board of
Directors actually awarded such Company Option, (iv) qualifies for the Tax and
accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the Companys Tax
Returns and the Company SEC Documents, respectively, and (v) does not trigger
any liability for the holder thereof under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary and (ii) the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital
stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any
other Person, other than equity securities in a publicly traded company or
other entity held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
consisting of less than one percent of the outstanding capital stock of such
company or other entity. The Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company, and all of
such shares of capital stock or other equity interests are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights in
favor of any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.
There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, puts,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities or other similar rights,
agreements or commitments to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party (A) obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) issue,
transfer, exchange, sell or register for sale any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of any Subsidiaries of the Company or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (y)

shares of capital stock or other equity interests or (B) granting any
preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect to any security issued by any
Subsidiaries of the Company. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly,

Approvals; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to adoption of this Agreement by holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote

Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have
been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board of Directors and, except
for the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or vote of the Companys
stockholders are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The Company Board of Directors has

Recommendation_ "), (ii) declared this Agreement advisable under Section

for consideration by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company and is enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies and the availability of equitable relief (the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ").

the " _Transaction Approvals_ "), and subject to the accuracy of Parents and
Merger Subs representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_, no
authorization, consent, order, or approval of, or registration, declaration,
notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be made or
obtained under applicable Law for the completion by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, except for
such authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, registrations, declarations,
notices and filings that are not required to be made or obtained prior to the
completion of such transactions or that the failure to make or obtain would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger.

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
(assuming the Transaction Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not, (i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration of, any loan, guarantee of
Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract,
instrument, permit

 



      
 

 



 

or license binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which or
to which any of their respective properties, rights or assets are bound or
subject, or result in the creation of any liens, claims, mortgages,
encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities or charges of any kind
(each, a " _Lien_ ") other than Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
such losses, suspensions, limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations,
defaults, terminations, cancellation, or accelerations or Liens as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii)
conflict with or violate any applicable Laws except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially impair the ability of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all forms, documents,
certifications, statements and reports required to be filed or furnished by it
with the SEC since the Applicable Date, including notes, exhibits and
schedules thereto and all other information incorporated by reference and any
amendments and supplements thereto and the forms, documents, certifications,
statements and reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including notes, exhibits and
schedules thereto and all other information incorporated by reference and any

Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied, or if not yet
filed or furnished, will comply with, the applicable requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
and the Company SEC Documents did not, and any Company SEC Documents filed
with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is, or at any time since
the Applicable Date has been, required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC.

 



 

(b) None of the Company SEC Documents is subject to a pending Proceeding by or
before the SEC, and there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(c) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Documents (i) fairly present, or, in the case of Company SEC
Documents filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results
of their

 



      
 

 



 

operations, retained earnings (loss) and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein, including the notes thereto, that will not be material in amount or
effect) and (ii) in each case, were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto).

 



 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in paragraph (e) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15
under the Exchange Act), as required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 



 

(b) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in paragraph (f) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act), as required by Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management of the Company and the Company Board of
Directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements.

 



 

(c) The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 25, 2017, and such assessment concluded that such system was
effective. The Companys independent registered public accountant has issued
(and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2017. Since the Applicable Date, there have been
no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or would be reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Based on its most recent internal evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of the Company has
disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board of Directors (the " _Audit Committee_ ") (i) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely

documents, correspondence or information in a manner to remove the basis for
the objection, including by compliance with the procedures set forth in the

Change, terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.2(b)_ and
concurrently pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Fee
as provided in _Section 7.4(a)(i)_, if: (A) the Company receives a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of
_Section 5.3_ that has not been withdrawn and (B) the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and the Companys financial advisor, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (1) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change may not be so made and
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ may not so

 



      
 

 



 

occur unless and until the Company shall have given Parent written notice that
the Company Board of Directors intends to convene a meeting to consider
making, and to vote in respect of making, a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, together with a reasonably detailed description of the Company
Superior Proposal (including, without limitation to _Section 5.3(e)_, the
terms and conditions of the Company Superior Proposal and true and complete
copies of all relevant proposed documentation providing for such Company
Superior Proposal (including any Company Acquisition Agreements)), at least
four (4) Business Days in advance of convening such meeting of the Company
Board of Directors and formally voting thereat (the " _Superior Proposal
Notice Period_ "); (2) during the pendency of the Superior Proposal Notice
Period, if requested by Parent, the Company Board of Directors shall authorize
and instruct its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives to revise this Agreement (in the form of a proposed
binding amendment of this Agreement) so as to enable the Company Board of
Directors to determine in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and the Companys financial advisor, that after giving effect to the
modifications to this Agreement contemplated by such proposed binding
amendment, such Company Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal; and (3) at the expiration of the Superior Proposal Notice
Period, and at such meeting of the Company Board of Directors, the Company
Board of Directors, after having taken into account the revisions to this
Agreement proposed by and negotiated with Parent in the manner and form
referred to in clause (2) above, shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor, that a
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law ( _it
being agreed_ that any revisions to the financial terms of, or any amendments
to any of the other substantive terms of, any Company Takeover Proposal or
Company Acquisition Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a new Company
Takeover Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.3(d)_, including for
purposes of commencing a new Superior Proposal Notice Period(s), except that
subsequent to the initial Superior Proposal Notice Period, the subsequent
Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days).
Notwithstanding the first sentence in this _Section 5.3(d)_ or anything else
to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, if at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if: (A) an Intervening Event
shall have occurred and be continuing and (B) the Company Board of Directors
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and the Companys financial advisor, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that (1) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change may not be so made unless
and until the Company shall have given Parent written notice that the Company
Board of Directors intends to convene a meeting to consider making, and to
vote in respect of making, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, together
with a reasonably detailed description of the nature of the Intervening Event
that has occurred and is continuing, at least four (4) Business Days in
advance of convening such meeting of the Company Board of Directors and
formally voting thereat (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), (2)
during the pendency of the Intervening Event Notice Period, if requested by
Parent, the Company Board of Directors shall authorize and instruct its
Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this
Agreement (in the form of a

 



      
 

 



 

proposed binding amendment of this Agreement) to enable the Company Board of
Directors to determine in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and the Companys financial advisors that, after giving effect to the
modifications to this Agreement contemplated by such proposed binding
amendment, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
of Directors under applicable Law; and (3) at the expiration of the
Intervening Event Notice Period and at the meeting of the Company Board of
Directors, after having taken into account the modifications to this Agreement
proposed by Parent in the manner and form described in clause (2) above, shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the
Companys financial advisor, that a failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board of Directors under applicable Law. For purposes of clarification
and certainty, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted to
terminate this Agreement in respect of, or due to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made by the Company Board of Directors in response to or
in respect of an Intervening Event. The Company hereby expressly confirms and
agrees that the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 5.3(d)_, to
the extent it relates to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to or in respect of an Intervening Event, has been agreed to by the parties
hereto pursuant to Section 146 of the DGCL.

 



 

(e) The Company shall:

 



 

(i) promptly and (A) in any event within 24 hours after the expiration of the
Go-Shop Period, advise Parent in writing of the existence and identity of any
Excluded Party and (B) not later than within 24 hours after receipt thereof by
the Company or any of its Representatives, including during the Go-Shop
Period, give Parent notice in writing of (1) any Company Takeover Proposal or
any request for information in connection with any Company Takeover Proposal
or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Takeover Proposal, setting forth in such notice (to the extent not
theretofore publicly disclosed or previously disclosed to Parent) (x) the
material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or request
for information, inquiry or proposal (including any changes thereto) and (y)
the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or
request for information, inquiry or proposal, or (2) any new substantive
developments, discussions or negotiations relating to any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Takeover Proposal being conducted on behalf of the Company by the
Company Board of Directors (or its Representatives);

 



 

(ii) keep Parent informed in all material respects on a prompt basis (and in
any event within 24 hours of any substantive developments or changes in
status) of the status and details of any Company Takeover Proposal (including
any material changes to the terms thereof); and

 



 

(iii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof (but in any event within 24 hours) copies of any Company Takeover
Proposal or request for information, inquiry or proposal received in writing
(including drafts of any Company Acquisition Agreements) exchanged between the
Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives and any Person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal or
request for information, inquiry or proposal.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) making any public announcement or
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if such disclosure is required under
applicable Law, (ii) disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) or Item 1012 (a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act,
or (iii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of any
doubt, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, a factually accurate
public or other statement or disclosure made by the Company, including in
response to any unsolicited, or during the Go-Shop Period, solicited, inquiry,
proposal or offer made by any Person to the Company or its Representatives
that is not in violation of _Section 5.3_ shall not, in itself, constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change for any purpose of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any disclosures, statements or other
communications of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section
5.3(f)_ fail to expressly reaffirm therein the Company Recommendation, or has
the effect of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Company Recommendation
in any manner adverse to Parent, such disclosure, statement or other
communication shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) From the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective
Time, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) from the restrictions, prohibitions and provisions of
any Takeover Statute (including the restrictions on "business combinations"
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL) or terminate, amend or otherwise modify
or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions
of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof; _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted to exempt
any Person from the provisions of any Takeover Statute and to terminate, amend
or otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any such
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
preliminary proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, in each case, in the
form or forms mailed to the Companys stockholders, the " _Proxy Statement_
"). Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all information
concerning Parent, Merger Sub and their

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives that is reasonably requested by the Company or required by
applicable Law in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The
information supplied by the Company and Parent, as applicable, for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of any meeting of
Company stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger (including the
Company Stockholders Meeting), contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made therein based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein, and no representation or
warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation therein.

 



 

(b) The Company shall (i) provide Parent, its outside legal counsel and its
other Representatives with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
drafts of the Proxy Statement and other documents and communications related
to the Company Stockholders Meeting prior to filing, furnishing or delivering
such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and dissemination of
such documents to the Companys stockholders and (ii) consider in good faith
including in the Proxy Statement and such other documents and communications
related to the Company Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent, its outside legal counsel and its other Representatives, and the
Company agrees that all information relating to Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives included in the Proxy Statement shall be in
form and content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably; _provided_ that
the Company shall not have such obligations with respect to any Proxy
Statement and other documents and communications relating to a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
(whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with
true and complete copies or, if oral, summary descriptions, of all
correspondence between the Company and any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and provide Parent, its outside legal counsel and its
other Representatives a reasonable opportunity to participate in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC (or portions of any such discussions or
meetings that relate to the Proxy Statement); _provided_ that the Company
shall not have such obligations with respect to any Proxy Statement and other
documents and communications relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change made in accordance with _Section 5.3_. The Company shall, subject to
the requirements of _Section 5.4(b)_, respond promptly to any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof) any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the
Company that should be set forth in an amendment or

 



       
 

 



 

supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by
the Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, in definitive
form, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any
comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary
Proxy Statement.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 5.3_ and _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company shall take
all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Companys
Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") as
soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders (but in any event within thirty-five days after the
date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the
Company may file and commence mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement (and
if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to
such day)). Subject to _Section 5.3_ or this _Section 5.4_, unless the
Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall
solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including by
soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger and this Agreement).

 



 

(e) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
document that the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed
and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) (the " _Original Date_ ") there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (iii)
if the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Company
Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained if the Company Stockholders
Meeting is held on the Original Date, as long as, in the cases of the
foregoing _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than ten days in connection with
any one postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty days
from the Original Date (unless the Company shall have received prior written
consent of Parent), or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). During
any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall continue in
all respects to comply with its obligations under this _Section 5.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company may not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(g) Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than related procedural matters)
that the Company may propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) an annual base salary
or wage rate and target short term annual cash bonus opportunity which are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those that were provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) that are at least as favorable to those provided to the
Continuing Employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee is
terminated during the 18-month period following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to provide, to such Continuing Employee severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits to which such Continuing Employee would
have been entitled under the applicable Company Benefit Plan disclosed in
Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting
periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived

give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each
applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with
Parent, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for
purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of
it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following
the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary
explicitly authorizes such participation and (ii) cause the Companys 401(k)
Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to be terminated effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the
Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Company causes the Company 401(k) Plan to be
terminated in accordance with _Section 5.5(c)_, prior to the Effective Time
and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all
actions as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan
and/or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by
Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") to (1) permit each Continuing Employee
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan,
and (2) obtain from the IRS a favorable determination letter on termination
for the Company 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, comply in all material respects with each of their respective
obligations under applicable Law and/or any collective bargaining agreement or
similar labor agreement to inform and consult (or otherwise) with any unions
or other similar labor organizations regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and comply with the notice requirements and other
requirements under the WARN Act in connection with any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (each as defined therein), or any similar triggering events
affecting any site of employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any permitted disclosures under the Confidentiality
Agreements, but subject to _clause (iii)_ of _Section 5.9_, prior to making
any broadly disseminated written or oral communications to the directors,
officers or other employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, the Company
shall provide Parent with a true and complete copy of the intended
communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments
in good faith.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating
any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Benefit
Plan in accordance their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or (iv) create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or

 



      
 

 



 

dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may
maintain.\\\

Subsidiaries to use their, reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary
and proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Law to
give and obtain (as the case may be) as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement all notices, acknowledgments, waivers, consents,
amendments or

 



      
 

 



 

other modification required under any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound (the " _Third-Party Consents_ ") and that are
necessary or advisable to be obtained in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and in connection
therewith, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (a) make any
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary
or economic value, (b) amend, supplement or otherwise modify any such Contract
or (c) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing, in each case for the
purposes of obtaining any Third-Party Consents, without the prior consent of

obligation of Parent to grant any consent pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence).

 



 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes and Similar Matters_. No Party shall take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover
Statute. If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or
regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws (including Section 203
of the DGCL) and regulations (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the Parties and that the
Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement to the
extent such Party may reasonably conclude that such press release or public
statement may be required by applicable Law, the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or court process, (ii) in the case of press releases or public
announcements by a Party with respect to a public announcement of a Takeover
Proposal by any Person or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with this Agreement or Parents response thereto, the Party shall
not be required to consult with the other Party but shall give the other Party
a true and complete copy of any such press release or public announcement
prior to the issuance thereof, and (iii) in the case of press releases or
other public announcements that are consistent with other communications made
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this _Section 5.9_,
neither Party shall be required to consult with or obtain the consent of the
other Party prior to the issuance thereof. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, prior to making any written broad-based

 



      
 

 



 

communications to the employees or independent contractors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company or
Parent (as applicable) shall provide the other Party with a copy of the
intended communication, such other Party shall have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and the Party seeking to
distribute any such communication shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the other Party that are timely
provided.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger), now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers or other employees, as the case
may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_
") as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in any agreement set forth on _Section 5.10(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (an " _Indemnity Agreement_ "), each as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of not less
than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to,
the Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent provided by: (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) any
Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party on the one hand and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, as in effect on the date
of this Agreement; and (iii) applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in
each case, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted
under applicable Law and the Companys Organizational Documents in effect as
of the date of this Agreement: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (including, in each case, any
interest or assessments thereon) in connection with any Proceeding, to the
extent such Proceeding arises out of or pertains to any action or omission or
alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer or other employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) of any Indemnified Party incurred or expected to be incurred
in connection with any such Proceeding, in each case, to the extent that such
Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Organizational Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, any Indemnity Agreement or applicable Law; _provided_ that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately

 



      
 

 



 

determined by final adjudication for which no further appeal may be taken that
such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay for only one
law firm to represent the Indemnified Parties (and local counsel in each
necessary jurisdiction) with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the exculpation and indemnification provisions set
forth in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to be no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties or the beneficiaries thereof than the provisions which are
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries. For a period of six
years after the Closing and at all times subject to applicable Law, Parent
shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving Corporation or any its
Subsidiaries or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) amend or
modify in any way adverse to the Indemnified Parties, or to the beneficiaries
thereof, the exculpation and indemnification provisions set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
make them less favorable to the Indemnified Parties or the beneficiaries
thereof than the provisions which are currently provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Companys
directors and officers insurance and indemnification policies with insurance
and indemnification coverage that provides limits and coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
no less favorable than the limits and coverage provided by the Companys
policies in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date hereof by the Company for such insurance;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance limits
and coverage currently in place at any time exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain insurance policies which, in its good faith
determination, provides the greatest limits and coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount. The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section
5.10_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_. The
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of each
Indemnified Party and his or her successors, heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(d) This _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and permitted
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall
be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or legal
representatives. In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that such other Person or the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its term, the Company shall

to cause its Representatives to, provide, at Parents sole expense, such
customary cooperation and customary and readily available financial
information and data, in each case, that is reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any debt financing (explicitly excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Parent Funding) obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated hereby (any such debt
financing, a " _Debt Financing_ ") (it being understood that the receipt of
any such Debt Financing is not a condition to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
cooperation shall be required to the extent it would (i) unreasonably disrupt
or interfere with the conduct of the Companys business, (ii) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other
liability prior to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed,
(iii) require any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to deliver, or be required to deliver, any certificate or take
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any personal
liability, (iv) require the Company to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement, (v) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any
information that is prohibited or restricted by applicable Law or is
privileged and disclosure of which would result in a loss of such privilege,
(vi) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare or deliver any
financial statements other than any such financial statements that are
required to be prepared and delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section
5.2_, (vii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into,
amend or modify any agreement or commitment that would not be conditioned on
the occurrence of, or would be effective prior to, the Effective Time (other
than customary authorization and representation letters) or (viii) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors,
managers or officers, to take any action to authorize any formal corporate or
similar action with respect to the Debt Financing that is not subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that
(A) Parent covenants and agrees that any offering documents, lender and
investor presentations, rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda or other marketing materials in connection with any Debt Financing
contemplated by this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall contain disclosures and
disclaimers exculpating the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors and officers with respect to any liability related to the contents
or use thereof by the recipients thereof, and (B) notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein, nothing herein shall require any director, manager
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who will not continue to
hold such position following the Effective Time to execute any resolution(s)
or written

 



      
 

 



 

consent(s), or any certification, instrument or agreement, in connection with
the any financing contemplated by this _Section 5.12(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, neither any breach or violation by
the Company of, or any failure by the Company to comply with, this _Section
5.12(a)_, nor any failure of Parent to obtain any Debt Financing contemplated
by this _Section 5.12(a)_ (regardless of whether or not the Company shall
have complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.12(a)_), shall (i)
be deemed a breach or violation by the Company of, or a failure by the Company
to comply with, this Agreement for any purpose, (ii) be deemed a failure by
the Company to perform and comply in all material respects with its covenants
under this Agreement for the purposes of _Section 6.3(b)_ or (iii) permit
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or otherwise,
unless in each case such breach, violation or failure by the Company is a
Willful and Material Breach and directly causes the Debt Financing not to be
obtained.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Parent Funding at or prior to the

amendment, waiver or otherwise) any assignment, reduction or novation of any

the Company has provided irrevocable written notice to Parent that (A) all
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been and

its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Termination or Abandonment Prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(a) by Parent, if (i) the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company shall have entered into a
Company Acquisition Agreement providing for a Company Superior Proposal, (iii)
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have committed a material breach
of _Section 5.3_, or (iv) the Company shall have committed a Willful and
Material Breach of _Section 5.4 _resulting in the failure of the Company to
convene the Company Stockholders Meeting prior to the third Business Day next
preceding the End Date, _provided_ that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_, if it is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by it in this
Agreement which has caused the Companys failure to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting prior to the third Business Day next preceding the End
Date; and

 



 

(b) by the Company, if the Company has not committed a material breach of
_Section 5.3_, and the Company Board of Directors authorizes the Company to
enter into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement relating to a Company
Superior Proposal in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section
5.3(d), the Company enters into such_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Company Acquisition Agreement,_ and the Company pays (or causes to be paid)
to Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently with such termination in
accordance with _Section 7.4_.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, this Agreement shall
terminate (except that the Confidentiality Agreements, the representations and
warranties and agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 3.26_ ( _No Other Representations or Warranties; Non-Reliance_ ),
_Section 4.8_ ( _No Other Representations or Warranties; Non-Reliance_ ),
_Section 5.12(d)_ ( _Financing Matters)_ , this _Section 7.3_ ( _Effect of
Termination_ ), _Section 7.4_ ( _Termination Fees_ ), _Article VIII_ (
_Miscellaneous_ ), and the provisions that substantively define any related
defined terms not substantively defined in _Article VIII_ shall survive any
termination), and there shall be no Liability on the part of the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the other except
as provided in _Section 7.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
_Section 7.4(e)_, _Section 7.4(f)_ and _Section 7.4(g)_, nothing herein
shall relieve (x) the Company from any Liability for any failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, if
required to pursuant to this Agreement, or (y) the Company from Liability for
a Willful and Material Breach of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the aggrieved Party shall
be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law or in equity subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ ( _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ );

 



 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ ( _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; Fiduciary Out for Superior Proposal; Material Breach of No-
Solicitation Covenant; Willful and Material Breach of Covenant to Hold
Stockholder Meeting_ );

 



 

(iii) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ ( _End Date_
) or _Section 7.1(d)_ ( _Company Stockholder Approval Not Obtained_ ) or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ ( _Company Breach_ ), (B) prior to such
termination but after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal
(substituting "a majority" for the 20% threshold set forth in the definition
of "Company Takeover Proposal") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") shall have
been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or publicly announced and,
in each case, not publicly withdrawn on a bona fide basis (and with respect to
any termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, at least ten Business Days
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof)), and (C) at any time on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates any Qualifying
Transaction or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Qualifying Transaction and such Qualifying Transaction is subsequently
consummated,

 



      
 

 



 

then in any such event the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent
the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds (x) in the case of
the foregoing _clause (i)_, concurrently with such termination, (y) in the
case of the foregoing _clause (ii)_, within two Business Days after such
termination and (z) in the case of the foregoing _clause (iii)_, upon the
completion of such Qualifying Transaction.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ ( _Company Stockholder Approval Not Obtained_ ), the Company shall pay
to Parent all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger up to $1,500,000 (the "
_Parent Expense Reimbursement_ "), in immediately available funds.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount
equal to $17,000,000 (such payment, the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), in
immediately available funds within two Business Days following such
termination.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee or the
Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement payable pursuant
to _Section 7.4(a)_, _Section 7.4(c)_ and _Section 7.4(b)_, respectively,
are not intended to be a penalty but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, is due
and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event
shall Parent be entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee and the
Parent Expense Reimbursement, or the Company to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, on more than one occasion.

 



 

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, or Parent fails
to pay in a timely manner the Parent Termination Fee, then the Company shall
pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to the Company, as applicable, its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in connection with any Proceeding commenced by Parent or Merger Sub or
the Company, as applicable, that results in a judgment against the Company for
the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement or against
Parent for the Parent Termination Fee (as applicable), together with interest
on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to
but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus 2% per annum.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to (A) the Companys rights under _Section 8.5_, and (B) the
Companys rights as a third

 



      
 

 



 

party beneficiary of the Subscription Agreement pursuant to Section 9.20 of
the Subscription Agreement, and except for (i) any liabilities or obligations
arising under the Confidentiality Agreements, and (ii) any liabilities or
obligations arising under any of the provisions of this Agreement that
explicitly survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.3_ (collectively, the " _Retained Liabilities_ "), each of the Parties
expressly acknowledges and agrees that (x) the Companys right to terminate
this Agreement and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee in full pursuant
to _Section 7.4(c)_, as applicable, shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
any of its or their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
other employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") against Parent, the Investors, Merger Sub, any other potential
debt or equity financing source and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates or any former,
current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder,
member, manager, director, officer, other employee, agent or Affiliate of any
of the foregoing, (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all
losses and damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof)
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such
transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (whether
willful, intentional, unilateral or otherwise, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Willful and Material Breach) of any covenant or agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith, and (y) upon the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to _Section 7.4(c)_ following
a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_,
(A) subject to _Section 8.5_ and except for the Retained Liabilities, none of
the Parent Related Parties shall have any further Liability to any of the
Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Parent Funding or the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) subject to
_Section 8.5_ and except for the Retained Liabilities, none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party shall seek to recover any
other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages
suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Subject to _Section 8.5_ and except for the Retained Liabilities,
in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be subject to (nor shall any Company
Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of an amount equal
to the Parent Termination Fee, in the aggregate, for any losses or other
Liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches by Parent or Merger
Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that any Company
Related Party may have, including for a failure of the Closing to occur in
breach of _Section 1.2_ or in respect of any oral representation made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith.

 



 

(g) While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)_ to cause the Closing to occur
and, following termination of this Agreement, the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee under _Section 7.4(c)_, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)_ to cause
the Closing to

 



      
 

 



 

occur (so long as the Closing shall actually thereafter occur) and the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4(c)_ in connection with this
Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, but subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, nothing herein shall limit the Companys right to receive the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4(c)_ notwithstanding that the Company
has sought (but was not granted) specific performance or injunctive relief to
cause the Closing to occur pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)_ and the fact that the
Company is entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee under _Section
7.4(c)_ shall not limit the Companys rights to specific performance or
injunctive relief to cause the Closing to occur pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)_.

Warranties; Non-Reliance_ ), _Section 4.8_ ( _No Other Representations or

CONNECTED WITH, ARISE OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER, IS EXPECTED
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, CONNECTED WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR
OTHERWISE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT
DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER. EACH PARTY HEREBY

 



      
 

 



 

ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES

Section 8.5 _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, subject to _Section 8.5(b)_ and _8.5(c)_ , each
Party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies a Party may
have in equity or at law subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any
breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of
this Agreement, consistent with the provisions of _Section 8.4(b)_, without
necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any
Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
hereby agree that the Company shall only be entitled to specific performance
of Parents obligations to cause the Parent Funding to be funded under the
Subscription Agreement in accordance with its terms if, and only if, (i) all
of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but which conditions at such time are capable of being satisfied) at
the time the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_,
(ii) the Designated Novation has not occurred in accordance with Section
8.7(b), (iii) the conditions in Section 5 of the Subscription Agreement have
been satisfied (other than those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
the Initial Closing (as defined by the Subscription Agreement), but which
conditions at such time are capable of being satisfied) and (iv) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and
able to consummate the Closing if such specific performance is granted
pursuant to this _Section 8.5(b)_ and, if necessary, _Section 8.5(c)_, and
if the Parent Funding is funded, then the Closing would occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 8.5(b)_ shall not apply
to or otherwise limit the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief under Section 8.5(a)or _8.5(c)_ for
obligations other than with respect to the obligations of Parent to cause the
Parent Funding to be funded under the Subscription Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
hereby agree that the Company shall only be entitled to specific performance
of Parents obligations to effect the Closing if, and only if, (i) all of the
conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but which conditions at such time are capable of being satisfied) at the time
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (ii) the
Designated Novation has not occurred in accordance with _Section 8.7(b)_ and
the Parent Funding has been funded or the Investors have confirmed in writing
to Parent that, if specific performance is granted pursuant hereto, the Parent
Funding will be funded in accordance with the Subscription Agreement
concurrently at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to
Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing
if such specific performance is granted pursuant to this _Section 8.5(c)_ and
if the Parent Funding is funded, then the Closing would occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 8.5(c)_ shall not apply
to or otherwise limit the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief under _Section 8.5(a)_ or _8.5(b)_ for
obligations other than with respect to the obligations of Parent to effect the
Closing.
