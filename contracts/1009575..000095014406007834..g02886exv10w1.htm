the extent attributable to the Compensation Deduction to which Purchaser was determined not
to be entitled, plus the amount of any interest and penalties imposed by a taxing authority
with respect to any adjustment to Tax attributable to such disallowed Compensation
Deduction.

appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the
settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding.

(the &#147;<U>Initial Negotiation Period</U>&#148;, which period may be extended by mutual agreement) shall

documentary representations made by the parties during such negotiations shall be admissible for
any purpose in any subsequent proceedings, except as required by Law, in the course of an Action or
Governmental Order as may be requested or required by a Governmental Authority or by any listing

&#147;<U>Mediation Rules</U>&#148;) of the American Arbitration Association (the &#147;<U>AAA</U>&#148;). If no
mediator has been agreed upon by the parties within 30&nbsp;days of receipt by a party of a Mediation
Request, then any party may request that the AAA appoint a mediator in accordance with the
Mediation Rules. The Mediation shall be held in the location of the principal place of business of
the party that did not request the Mediation first. All Mediation pursuant to this clause shall be
confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or
documentary representations made by the parties during such Mediation shall be admissible for any
purpose in any subsequent proceedings, except as required by Law, in the course of an Action or a

agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer

mediator, within 60&nbsp;days of receipt by a party or parties of a Mediation Request, or within 90&nbsp;days
of receipt by a party of notice in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.12(a) (whichever occurs sooner) then,

bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to the Purchaser; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to preclude the Guarantor from asserting
any of the defenses that would have been available to the Purchaser; <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, that the aggregate liability of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.
