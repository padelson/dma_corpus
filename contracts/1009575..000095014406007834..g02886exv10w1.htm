 (b) On the third Business Day prior to the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a supplement to Sections 3.10, 3.14, 3.17(v), (vi) and (vii), 3.18 and 3.20(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_") containing all matters occurring after the date hereof, if any, which, if such matters had occurred prior to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described on such schedules. For purposes of Section 8.02(a), the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to include any matter set forth in the Disclosure Schedule Supplement that should have been set forth on the Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.16 _Transition Services_.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS  

  

 Section 6.01 _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date set forth in Exhibit 6.01, the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to notify the Seller in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable following the termination of employment of any employee who is listed on Exhibit 6.01. The Seller agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of any letter agreement set forth in item 1 of Section 3.09 of the Disclosure Schedule entered into between the Seller and any such listed employee. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a complete and accurate list of all employees of the Companies, including, for each such employee the following information: job title; place of work; date of employment commencement; current base salary, wage rate or fee rate; bonus and incentive compensation paid for 2005 and target bonus percentage for 2006; and classification as exempt or non-exempt and part-time or full-time, and for each such employee, the accrued vacation for such employee as reported in the Companys time off reporting system as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Employee List_ "). 

   

 (c) For a period of one year immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to provide, or to cause the Companies to provide, to employees of the Companies, employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, not materially less favorable than those provided by the Companies and the Seller to the employees of the Companies immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that such employee benefits shall not include equity-related benefit plans. 

   

 (d) With respect to any employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or a Company in which the employees of the Companies participate pursuant to Section 6.01(c), the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Companies to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or would otherwise not be excluded or required, in each case, as of the Closing under the Plans in which such employees were participating immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) credit all deductibles and co-pays under any of the Plans that are health plans, during the applicable plan year that includes the Closing, towards deductibles and co-pays under the health plan of the Purchaser or a Company, as the case may be, for the plan year that includes the Closing Date; and (iii) to the extent such employees participate in employee benefit plans of the Purchaser or a Company other than the Plans from and following the Closing, and subject to Section 6.01(b), recognize all service of such employees with the Seller or any of its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual under any such employee benefit plan, severance policy, or vacation, sick, holiday or other paid leave policy of the Purchaser or a Company in which such employees become eligible to participate after the Closing, in each case, to the same extent taken into account under any corresponding plan or policy in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not be construed in any way that would result in a duplication of benefits provided to any such employee. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.01 shall impede or limit the Purchaser or the Companies from terminating any of their employees at any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the provisions of applicable Law and applicable Contracts. 

   

ARTICLE VII 

   

TAX MATTERS  

  

 Section 7.01 _Tax Indemnities_. 

   

 (a) The Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against all Excluded Taxes and associated expenses. The Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless against all Taxes and associated expenses other than Excluded Taxes. 

   

 (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the date of the Closing shall be: 

    

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.06), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable period ended on the date of the Closing; and 

   

 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the date of the Closing and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. 

   

 (iii) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and/or the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based upon the method employed in Sections 7.01(b)(i) and 7.01(b)(ii) above taking into account the type of Tax to which the credit or refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(b) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the date of the Closing. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries as the case may be. 

  

 (c) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under this Section 7.01 shall be made within 10 days following written notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority is due; _provided_ , that the Purchaser shall comply with its obligation to promptly notify the Seller under Section 7.03(a); _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two days   ##### 

  

  

  

before it is due to the appropriate taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, if the Seller receives an assessment or other notice
of Taxes due with respect to the Companies for which the Seller is not
responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
7.01, then the Purchaser shall pay such Taxes, or if the Seller pays
such Taxes, then the Purchaser or the Companies shall pay to the Seller the
amount of such Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within ten days
following the Purchasers receipt of written notice of the Sellers having
made such payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate
taxing authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a
final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing
authority or court. 

   

 (d) Transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing Date but after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business of the Companies and not contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as occurring on the next day and as such shall for purposes of this Agreement be treated (and consistently reported by the parties) as occurring in the taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning the day after the Closing Date). 

   

 Section 7.02 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. 

   

 (a) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portions of taxable period) ending on or before the date of the Closing shall be for the benefit and the property of the Seller, and if received by the Purchaser or the Companies, shall be paid over promptly to the Seller. The Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, cause the Companies or other relevant entity to file for and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the receipt of any refund to which the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall permit the Seller to participate in (at the Sellers expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any such Tax refund, credit or similar benefit for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in the manner set forth in Section 7.01(b). 

   

 (b) Any amount otherwise payable by the Seller under Section 7.01 shall be reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized (either by cash refund or actual reduction of Taxes otherwise payable) net of any current Tax detriment actually realized (either by reduction in cash refund or actual increase in Taxes payable) by the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Companies in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a result of the tax payment or any underlying adjustment resulting in the obligation of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Companies to pay Taxes or other amounts for which the Seller is responsible under Section 7.01 or the accrual or payment of such Taxes. 

   

 Section 7.03 _Contests_. 

   

 (a) After the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the other party or its Affiliates which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification under Section 7.01. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to such party)   ##### 

  

  

  

describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If either party fails to give the
other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this
Section 7.03, then such party shall not have any obligation to indemnify for
any loss arising out of such asserted Tax liability, but only to the extent
that failure to give such notice results in a detriment to such party. 

   

 (b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing, the Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such Contest; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Seller shall not settle or compromise any asserted liability with respect to any such Contest without the prior written consent of the Purchaser if such settlement or compromise would adversely affect the Tax liability of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Companies in a post-Closing Tax period, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Seller may elect to direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01 if the amount of such asserted Tax liability attributable to Excluded Taxes, in the Purchasers good faith judgment, equals or exceeds the amount of such asserted Tax liability that is not attributable to Excluded Taxes, determined in a manner consistent with Section 7.01(b). If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, the Seller shall within 60 days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause the Companies to reasonably cooperate, at the Sellers expense, in each phase of such Contest. If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, then the Purchaser may participate in such Contest, at the Purchasers expense. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, the Purchaser may assume control of such Contest (at the Purchasers expense). If the Purchaser assumes control of such Contest (whether because the Seller elects not to assume control or because it is not entitled to control such Contest), then the Seller may participate, at its own expense, in the Contest. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser may settle or compromise any asserted liability with respect to any Contest governed by this Section 7.03(c) without prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) The Purchaser and the Seller agree to reasonably cooperate, and agree to cause their Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Contest. 

   

 Section 7.04 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

   

 (a) The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause the Companies to prepare and file) all income and franchise Tax Returns relating to the Companies for taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing and all other Tax Returns required to be filed prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Companies to prepare and file) all Tax Returns of the Companies that are not prepared by the Seller pursuant to subparagraph (a) above (including Straddle Periods); it being understood that all Taxes shown as   ##### 

  

  

  

due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the
Purchaser, except for such Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller
pursuant to Section 7.01, which the Seller shall pay in accordance with this
Article VII. Such Tax Returns for the first period ending after the Closing
Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior
taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law.
With respect to any such Tax Return that begins prior to the Closing Date or
as to which Taxes are otherwise allocable to the Seller under Section 7.01
hereof, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its
authorized Representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a
statement (with which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules
and information) certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that
is allocable to the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01 at least 30 days prior
to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax
Return, and the Seller and its authorized Representative shall have the right
to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of
such Tax Return. The Purchaser shall reflect such comments as are reasonably
requested by the Seller on such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree
to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a
result of the review of such Tax Return and statement by the Seller or its
authorized Representative. 

   

 (c) The Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Seller to cause the filing of any amended Tax Return reasonably requested by the Seller relating to a taxable period (or portions thereof) of any Company ending or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the Seller will pay or reimburse the Purchaser for any professional fees incurred by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the preparation and filing of such amended Tax Return. 

   

 Section 7.05 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. 

   

 The Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall cause the Companies to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 7.05. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Companies for any taxable period that includes the date of the Closing and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other partys expense). Any information obtained under this Section 7.05 shall be kept confidential, 

   ##### 

  

    

except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. 

  

 Section 7.06 _Conveyance Taxes_. 

   

 All Conveyance Taxes and reasonable costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of any required returns or statements with respect thereto and the computation and payment thereof shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Seller. Conveyance Taxes shall be paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, by the party primarily liable for the payment of such Taxes under applicable Law. In connection with the payment of any such Conveyance Tax, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten days after the presentation of such statement. The non-paying party shall cooperate with the paying party in the execution of any returns or statements required to be filed with respect to any Conveyance Taxes to the extent such execution is required by Law. 

  

 Section 7.07 _Tax Covenants_. 

   

 Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit any Company to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any taxable period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before the date of the Closing without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 Section 7.08 _Miscellaneous_. 

   

 (a) For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article VII, under any other indemnity provisions contained in this Agreement, and for any breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, as adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Purchaser, the Seller, Affiliates or the Companies include successors. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof). 

   

 (d) Except for this Agreement, any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement to which any of the Companies is a party shall be terminated, and all payments thereunder settled, immediately prior to the Closing with no payments permitted to be made thereunder on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) Payments by the Seller under this Article VII shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any indemnity, contribution or   ##### 

  

  

  

other similar payment recovered by the Purchaser, the Companies or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any Affiliates of the Purchaser from any
third party with respect thereto. 

   

 Section 7.09 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. 

   

 In connection with the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby, the parties hereto shall cause an express election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to be made for the Companies and shall cause similar elections to be made where appropriate for state Tax purposes (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). No later than thirty (30) days prior to the last date on which the Section 338(h)(10) Election must be filed, the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller all forms and other schedules and documents necessary to file the Section 338(h)(10) Election, with reasonable instructions to the Seller with respect to the signing and filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and the Seller will comply with such reasonable instructions in signing and filing the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Within 90 days following the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with an allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of the Companies (the " _Allocation_ ") for the Purchasers review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Code Sections 338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree on the Allocation, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit the items in dispute for resolution to Deloitte and Touche LLP (or, if such firm shall decline or be unable to act, or is not, at the time of such submission, independent of the Purchaser and the Seller, then to another independent valuation or accounting firm of international reputation mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser), which shall, as soon as practicable after such submission, determine and report to the Seller and the Purchaser its resolution of such disputed items. The report of such firm shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees for such firm shall be paid in the same manner as the Independent Accounting Firm as described in Section 2.08(b). The Allocation shall be binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller and neither party (nor any of their Affiliates) shall file any Tax Return, or take a position with a Tax authority, that is inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise required by Law. The Seller and the Purchaser hereby agree to revise the Allocation to reflect any adjustment made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08. 

  

 Section 7.10 _Options; Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (a) In the event that subsequent to the Closing Date any current or former employee of a Company exercises options to purchase stock of the Seller which options were received by such employee in connection with the performance of services for such Company or its Affiliates, as the case may be, and are outstanding on the Closing Date (the " _Seller Options_ "), the Seller and the Purchaser agree and acknowledge that they shall report the exercise of the Seller Options in accordance with Section 7.01(c). The Purchaser shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to), upon the request of the Seller, inform the Seller whether any employee holding Seller Options continues to be employed by a Company and, if not, the date of termination and whether such termination is the result of a layoff or job elimination or a voluntary termination by such employee. 

   

 (b) In the event that subsequent to the Closing Date any current or former employee of a Company becomes vested (in whole or in part) in any restricted stock of the Seller   ##### 

  

  

  

which (i) was received by such employee in connection with the performance of
services for such Company or its Affiliates, as the case may be, and (ii)
with respect to which an effective election under Section 83(b) of the Code
was not made (the " _Seller Restricted Stock_ "), the Seller and the
Purchaser agree and acknowledge that they shall report the vesting of the
Seller Restricted Stock in accordance with Section 7.10(c). The Purchaser
shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to), upon the request of the Seller,
inform the Seller whether any employee holding Seller Restricted Stock
continues to be employed by a Company and, if not, the date of
termination and whether such termination is the result of a layoff or job
elimination or a voluntary termination by such employee. 

   

 (c) Upon the exercise of the Seller Options or the vesting of the Seller Restricted Stock, as applicable, the Seller (and not the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) shall (i) claim the compensation expense deduction associated with such exercise or vesting measured by the fair market value of the Seller stock at the time of such exercise (less the exercise price) or vesting (the " _Compensation Deduction_ ") , (ii) pay all employment and withholding Taxes resulting from such exercise or vesting and (iii) file all Tax Returns related to the payment of such employment and withholding Taxes. 

   

 (d) If, upon the subsequent disposition of an audit or other examination by a Governmental Authority (whether by settlement or otherwise), it is determined that a Compensation Deduction should have been reported by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not by the Seller, then: 

    

 (i) if necessary, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser and shall provide the Purchaser with adequate information so that it can reflect the Compensation Deduction on the appropriate Tax Returns; 

   

 (ii) the Purchaser shall pay the Seller the amount of any Tax benefits actually realized by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (either by cash refund or actual reduction in Taxes otherwise payable) that relates to any adjustments resulting from such Compensation Deduction within 30 days of the date such Tax benefits are realized; and 

   

 (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall only be required to take steps to obtain such Tax benefit or to pay the Seller if, in the opinion of the Purchasers Tax counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller, the reporting of such Tax benefit shall not subject the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the imposition of a penalty unless the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser for such penalty . If the Purchaser shall have made payments hereunder to the Seller in respect of any Compensation Deduction and it shall thereafter be determined that the Purchaser was not entitled to claim all or part of such Compensation Deduction, the Seller shall remit to the Purchaser, promptly upon receipt of notice from the Purchaser, the amount of any such prior payment to the extent attributable to the Compensation Deduction to which Purchaser was determined not to be entitled, plus the amount of any interest and penalties imposed by a taxing authority with respect to any adjustment to Tax attributable to such disallowed Compensation Deduction.

and warranties contained in Section 3.13 shall survive the Closing for a
period of three years after the Closing Date; and (d) the representations and

with reasonable specificity by the party seeking to be indemnified within the
time periods set forth in this Section 9.01 shall survive until such claim is
finally and fully resolved; and (e) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.07(b)(i) shall not survive the Closing.

 The Purchaser shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Seller for and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, but excluding any allocation of corporate overhead, internal legal-department costs and other internal costs and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by it (hereinafter, " _Losses_ "), arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained in this Agreement or (ii) the breach of any (A) pre-Closing covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this Agreement or (B) post-Closing covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this Agreement or (iii) the matter set forth in Exhibit 9.02. 

  

 Section 9.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. 

   

 The Seller shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser for and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser or the Guarantor contained in this Agreement; or (ii) the breach of any (A) pre-Closing covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or (B) post-Closing covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.04 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against either party for breach of any representation or warranty contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or Action is received by such party, in accordance with Section 9.05, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 (other than with respect to any breach of Section 11.01(b)) or Section 9.03, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $2,825,000, after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for those   ##### 

  

  

  

Losses in excess of such amount; (ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or
resulting from the causes set forth in Section 9.02 (other than with respect
to any breach of Section 11.01(b)) or Section 9.03 shall be an amount equal

Ancillary Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special
or indirect damages, including loss of business reputation relating to the

diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple, whether
based on statute, contract, tort or otherwise, and whether or not arising
from the Indemnifying Partys sole, joint, or concurrent negligence, strict
liability, criminal liability or other fault; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the limitation in clause (iii) shall not limit an Indemnifying Partys
obligation to indemnify for any Losses of the types listed in clause (iii)
actually suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third-
Party Claim; and (iv) no Losses may be claimed under Section 9.02 or Section
9.03 by any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses are attributable to
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08. 

   

 (c) For all purposes of this Article IX, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any insurance, indemnification or other recoveries actually paid or that would have been paid had the Indemnified Party complied with its obligations in Section 9.06(b) to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under any insurance policy or any other Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and (ii) any Tax benefits actually realized (either by cash refund or actual reduction of Taxes otherwise payable) net of any Tax detriments actually realized (either by reduction of a cash refund or increase in Taxes otherwise payable) by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates during or prior to the Tax period in which the indemnification payment is made arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses. If a Tax benefit or Tax detriment is incurred after an indemnification payment has been made, an appropriate adjusting payment shall be made by or to the Indemnified party to give effect to this clause (ii) at the time that such Tax benefit or Tax detriment is actually realized. For purposes of this Article IX and Article VII, any payment of Losses shall first be made out of the Escrowed Funds to the extent available and then by the Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no rights for indemnification or any other recourse or remedy for any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties under this Agreement arising out of or resulting from or relating to the DOJ Investigation or the SEC Investigation (each as defined in the Indemnity Agreement) or the underlying or related facts and circumstances (" _DOJ Losses_ "). The parties further acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the Indemnity Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser and the Seller and their respective Affiliates for DOJ Losses. 

   

 Section 9.05 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 30 days of such determination, stating the estimated amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Party except in the event the Indemnified Partys failure to notify actually prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against such litigation or third-party claim. 

   

 (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim, demand or assessment against it by or from a third party other than an Affiliate of the Indemnified Party (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this Article IX, within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its expense and with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 15 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party, which notice from the Indemnifying Party shall include an acknowledgement by the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses incurred with respect to such Third Party Claim. In the event any Indemnified Party shall conclude that there is or is reasonably likely to be an actual conflict of interest with the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to select separate counsel to act on its behalf and the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be additional indemnifiable Losses under this Article IX. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense and the Indemnifying Party shall in good faith take into account the views of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not make any payment toward a settlement of such claim, nor permit to be paid any monies as part of a settlement, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party declines to direct the defense of any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.05 and the Indemnified Party proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding. 

   

 Section 9.06 _Remedies_. 

   

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and   ##### 

  

  

  

agree (i) that they are not entitled to rely on any representations or
warranties or other statements of fact or opinion, other than the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement,
including the schedules and exhibits hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements and
(ii) that in connection with the Purchasers investigation of the Companies,
the Purchaser has received certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
similar forward-looking statements relating to the future operating and
financial performance of the Companies and no representation or warranty
is being made by or on behalf of the Seller with respect to such matters. The
Purchaser and the Seller also acknowledge and agree that (i) following the
Closing, except in the case of fraud, the indemnification provisions of
Sections 9.02 and 9.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Purchaser and the Seller for any breach by the other party of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the
other party to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this
Agreement, except that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms thereof in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity and (ii) anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of
the Purchaser or the Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale
of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Losses. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery for any Losses against any and all relevant insurance policies available to the Indemnified Party promptly, whether before or after any payment by the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In the event any Losses are recoverable under such insurance policies, but are not received before any claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, as applicable, then in the event the Indemnified Party receives any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Party which would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment. 

   

 Section 9.07 _Tax Matters_. 

   

 Anything in this Article IX to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters other than the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.17 shall be solely governed by Article VII and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Article IX.

 (d) by the Purchaser if the Seller shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days following written notice by the Purchaser; or 

   

 (e) by the Seller if the Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days following written notice by the Seller.

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.01(d) as a result of the Sellers breach of Section 5.14, and the Seller enters into an agreement to consummate an Acquisition Proposal within twelve months following such termination, then the Seller shall pay the Purchaser a fee equal to $11,300,000 on the earlier to occur of the execution of the agreement to consummate such Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , the Purchaser shall not be in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement on the date this Agreement is terminated.

 Section 11.03 _Severability._  

    ##### 

  

  

 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 This Agreement, including all exhibits and the Disclosure Schedules, the Disclosure Schedule Supplement, if any, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 Section 11.05 _Assignment_. 

   

 This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be), except that (i) the Purchaser may assign this Agreement, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Seller, to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Guarantor, provided that such assignment shall not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) the Seller may assign this Agreement, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Purchaser, to any Person who may acquire all or substantially all the assets of the Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, any assignment or attempted assignment by the Guarantor without the express written consent of the Seller shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 

  

 Section 11.06 _Amendment_.

 Section 11.09 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

   

 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied (including the provisions of Article IX relating to indemnified parties), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of Sections 5.06 and 6.01 (except for the obligations of the Purchaser to the Seller or the Seller to the Purchaser) are statements of intent and no employee or other Person shall have any rights or remedies, including rights of enforcement, with respect thereto and no employee or other Person is or is intended to be a third-party beneficiary thereof.

All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York.

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

  

 Section 11.12 _Dispute Resolution Procedures_. 

   

 (a) Without limiting the rights of the parties in Section 11.14, the parties agree that they will attempt to promptly resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (the " _Dispute_ ") by informal negotiations. Any Dispute which is not settled by the parties within 20 Business Days after notice of such Dispute is given by one party to the other in writing (the " _Initial Negotiation Period_ ", which period may be extended by mutual agreement) shall be referred to the General Counsel of each of the Purchaser and the Seller who are authorized to settle such Disputes on behalf of their respective parties (the " _Authorized Representatives_ "). The Authorized Representatives will meet for negotiations within 20 Business Days after expiration of the Initial Negotiation Period at a time and place mutually acceptable to both Authorized Representatives. All negotiations pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or documentary representations made by the parties during such negotiations shall be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings, except as required by Law, in the course of an Action or Governmental Order as may be requested or required by a Governmental Authority or by any listing agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer quotation system. Subject to any rights to equitable relief, if the Dispute has not been resolved within 60 days after the end of the Initial Negotiation Period (the " _Final Negotiation Period_ ", which may be extended by mutual agreement), the Dispute will next be submitted to non-binding mediation as described in Section 11.12(b). 

  

 (b) Any Dispute which is not resolved by the parties during either the Initial Negotiation Period or the Final Negotiation Period shall, on the written request of either party (the " _Mediation Request_ "), be submitted to non-binding mediation (the " _Mediation_ ") as described in this Section 11.12(b) in accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules (the " _Mediation Rules_ ") of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "). If no mediator has been agreed upon by the parties within 30 days of receipt by a party of a Mediation Request, then any party may request that the AAA appoint a mediator in accordance with the Mediation Rules. The Mediation shall be held in the location of the principal place of business of the party that did not request the Mediation first. All Mediation pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or documentary representations made by the parties during such Mediation shall be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings, except as required by Law, in the course of an Action or a Governmental Order as may be requested or required by a Governmental Authority or by any listing agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer quotation system. If the Dispute has not been resolved within 30 days of the appointment of a mediator, within 60 days of receipt by a party or parties of a Mediation Request, or within 90 days of receipt by a party of notice in accordance with Section 11.12(a) (whichever occurs sooner) then, on the demand of any party, any Dispute shall be finally settled through legal action in accordance with Section 11.11. The mediator shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the mediator in the performance of its duties hereunder. All such fees and expenses shall be split equally between the parties. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) All applicable statute of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled while the procedure(s) specified in this Article XI is pending. The parties will take such action, if any, as is required to effectuate such tolling. 

   

 (d) This Section 11.12 shall not become effective unless the Closing shall have occurred. 

   

 Section 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

   

 Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) certifies that no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that its has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this Section 11.13. 

  

 Section 11.14 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. 

   

 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 11.15 _Counterparts_. 

   

 This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller and the Purchaser have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

 _GUARANTY_  

   

 The Guarantor hereby guarantees (the " _Guaranty_ ") the due and timely performance and payment of the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement (the " _Obligations_ "). The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of the Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor regardless of whether any action is brought against the Purchaser or whether the Purchaser is joined in any such action or actions. The Guaranty is a guaranty of performance and payment when due and not merely of collection. The Guaranty shall be unconditional regardless of any lack of enforceability of this Agreement or any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to the Purchaser; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to preclude the Guarantor from asserting any of the defenses that would have been available to the Purchaser; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the aggregate liability of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price. 

   

 _THE GUARANTOR MAKES THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 AND 4.06, AND AGREES TO COMPLY WITH THE GUARANTY AND WITH SECTIONS 5.04(b), 11.02, 11.05, 11.11 AND 11.13, BUT IS NOT BOUND BY ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT:_
