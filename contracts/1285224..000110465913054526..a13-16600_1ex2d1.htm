incorporation of Newco in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the Effective Time, be the articles of incorporation of the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation Charter_ "),
until further amended as provided in the Surviving Corporation Charter or by
the CGCL. The bylaws of Newco in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "

Section 1.6. _Directors and Officers_.

 **ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Newco, Saehan or the holder
of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Parties_. All shares of Saehan Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and are owned by Saehan or Wilshire (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
any DPC shares or shares for which Saehan is the holder of record for the
benefit of another Person) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
stock of Wilshire or other additional consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Saehan Common Stock_. Each share of Saehan Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and shares held by
Dissenting Shareholders), whether represented by a certificate (each a "
_Certificate_ ") or whether non-certificated and represented by book entry ("
_Book Entry Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of
Section 2.2(b) either (i) 0.06080 duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Wilshire Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ "), or (ii) $0.4247 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ "), or (iii) a unit consisting of Wilshire Common Stock and
cash in the amount set forth in Section 2.2(b) (such unit, together with the
Per Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.3(e), the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). None of such shares of Saehan Common Stock shall remain
outstanding and all of such shares automatically shall be cancelled and cease
to exist, and each stock certificate previously representing any such shares
thereafter shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)
and the right pursuant to Section 2.3(e) to receive payment of cash in lieu of
the issuance of fractional shares, without interest, if applicable, upon the
surrender of such stock certificates in accordance with Section 2.3.

 



 

(c) _Stock Options_. On or prior to the Closing Date, each holder of Saehan
Stock Options shall have entered into an Option Holder Agreement in the form
of **_Exhibit D_** attached to this Agreement (the " _Option Holder
Agreements_ ") providing for the termination of such holders Saehan Stock
Options. Each holder of such terminated Saehan Stock Options shall be entitled
to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) for holders of in-the-money Saehan
Stock Options, in lieu of each share of Saehan Common Stock that would
otherwise have been issuable upon exercise thereof, (A) the weighted average
sales price per share for Saehan Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board on the
Closing Date (or, in the event fewer than 100,000 shares of Saehan Common
Stock traded on the OTC Bulletin Board on the Closing Date, the Per Share Cash
Consideration), less (B) the exercise price per share with respect to the
corresponding Saehan Stock Option in question, and (ii) for holders of out-of-
the-money Saehan Stock Options, $500 per holder of out-of-the-money Saehan
Stock Options); _provided, however,_ that, at any time between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, Wilshire in its sole discretion may elect
to assume (or substitute a Wilshire stock option or options for) any Saehan
Stock Options not currently subject to such Option Holder Agreements in
accordance with Sections 8(g) and 16 of the Saehan stock option plans, and the
treatment of such options shall, without further action on the part of any
holder or any Party hereto, be accordingly changed for purposes of this
Section 2.1(c). Any payments pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) shall take place
only after the satisfaction or fulfillment or waiver of the conditions of
Closing contained in Articles VI. The Surviving Corporation shall collect in
cash (and timely pay) all applicable withholding and payroll taxes with
respect to such options and shall comply with all payroll reporting
requirements with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

"Aggregate Consideration" means the sum of (x) the Total Stock Consideration
and (y) the Total Cash Amount.

 



 

"Wilshire Average Closing Price" means the volume weighted average price of
the Wilshire Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (based on
"regular way" trading) for the twenty (20) trading days prior to the date of
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

"Total Cash Amount" means $50,369,522.

 



 

"Total Stock Amount" means 7,210,815 shares of Wilshire Common Stock.

 



 

"Total Stock Consideration" means the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Total Stock Amount by (y) the Wilshire Average Closing Price.

 



 

(e) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
any holder of Saehan Common Stock who is entitled to demand and who has
properly exercised a demand for dissenters rights pursuant to Section 1300
_et seq._ of the CGCL (the " _Dissenters  Rights Statute_"), and who shall
not have failed to perfect, effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholders
right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights Statute (each, a " _Dissenting
Shareholder_ ," and collectively, the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall be
entitled to receive and be paid the fair market value (the " _Payment_ ") of
the "dissenting shares" (as such term is defined in the Dissenters Rights
Statute) in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute. After the amount
of the Payment has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to the
Dissenters Rights Statute, any Dissenting Shareholder entitled to the Payment
pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute will be entitled to receive such
Payment, and the "dissenting shares" will thereupon be cancelled. If any
Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect, effectively withdrawn or
lost the right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights Statute with respect to
any shares of Saehan Common Stock, such shares shall thereupon each be treated
as though such share had been converted into the Merger Consideration. To the
extent that a holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares fails to perfect such
holders dissenters rights under the Dissenters Rights Statute, such
Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be treated as withdrawn dissenting shares
under this Agreement. Each holder of dissenting shares who becomes entitled to
payment for his or her Saehan Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the
Dissenters Rights Statute shall receive payment for such perfected dissenting
shares from Wilshire in accordance with the Dissenters Rights Statute. Saehan
shall give Wilshire (i) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or
payment for shares of Saehan Common Stock received by Saehan and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand or notices. Saehan shall not, without the prior
written consent of Wilshire, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer for settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands. "Proposed Dissenting
Shares" means shares of Saehan Common Stock whose holders provide notice of
dissent to Saehan prior to the Saehan Shareholder Meeting and do not vote in
favor of the Merger, in each case in accordance with the Dissenters Rights
Statute.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Election and Proration Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Wilshire shall cause an election statement permitting each holder of a
share of Saehan Common Stock the ability to elect consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) and subject to 2.2(e) (the " _Election Statement_ ") to be
mailed with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus on the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to each holder of record of Saehan Common Stock (the "
_Record Date_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Election Statement shall permit the holder to elect to receive (i)
the Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of all of such holders Saehan
Common Stock (" _Stock Election Shares_ "); (ii) the Per Share Cash
Consideration in respect of all of such holders Saehan Common Stock (" _Cash
Election Shares_ "); or (iii) the Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of
that portion of such holders Saehan Common Stock equal to the Stock
Percentage, rounded to the nearest whole share (the " _Mixed Stock Shares_ "),
and the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of that portion of

 



      
 

 



 

such holders Saehan Common Stock equal to the Cash Percentage, rounded to the
nearest whole share (the " _Mixed Cash Shares_ ," and together with the Mixed
Stock Shares, the " _Mixed Election Shares_ "). If a holder makes no election
with respect to such holders shares of Saehan Common Stock, or if there are
any shares of Saehan Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not otherwise received an effective, properly completed Election Statement on
or before 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the date prior to the Determination Date
(or such other time and date as Wilshire and Saehan may mutually agree) (the "
_Election Deadline_ "), such shares shall be deemed to be " _No Election
Shares_."

 



 

"Cash Percentage" shall mean the amount obtained by dividing the Total Cash
Amount by the Aggregate Consideration, expressed as a percentage.

 



 

"Stock Percentage" shall mean the amount equal to one (1) minus the Cash
Percentage, expressed as a percentage.

 



 

(c) Wilshire shall make available one or more Election Statements as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Saehan Common Stock between the Election Statement
Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the
Election Deadline, and Saehan shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

 



 

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Statement by the
Election Deadline, and such election is not revoked or changed prior to the
Election Deadline. Any Election Statement may be revoked or changed by the
person submitting such Election Statement at or prior to the Election
Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Statement, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Statements, and any good
faith decisions of Wilshire regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. Neither Wilshire nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Statement. To the
extent the holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares submits an Election Statement,
such holders election shall have no effect, the Exchange Agent will disregard
such Election Statement, and the Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be converted
in accordance with Section 2.1(e).

 



 

(e) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, Wilshire shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among the holders of Saehan Common Stock of rights to receive Wilshire Common
Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Statements as
follows:

 



 

(i) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash Shares
More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares, Proposed
Dissenting Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is greater than the Total Cash
Amount, then:

 



 

(A) all Mixed Stock Shares, Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

 



      
 

 



 

(B) all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of this
Section 2.2(e)(i), to be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration;

 



 

(C) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(D) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares and all
Mixed Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash Shares
Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting
Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

 



 

(A) all Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

 



 

(B) all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be deemed, for the purposes of this
Section 2.2(e)(ii), to be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration;

 



 

(C) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash Designated
Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(D) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares and all Mixed Stock Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting Shares and Mixed Cash Shares
Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares, Proposed Dissenting
Shares and the Mixed Cash Shares is equal or nearly equal (as determined by
the Exchange Agent) to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
above shall not apply, and all Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration,
and all Stock Election Shares, Mixed Stock Shares and No Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and
all Proposed Dissenting Shares shall be converted in accordance with Section
2.1(e).

 



       
 

 



 

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable proration processes consistent with the foregoing
and as shall be determined in good faith by Wilshire and reasonably
satisfactory to Saehan.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Wilshire shall (a) authorize an exchange agent, which person shall be a bank
or trust company selected by Wilshire and reasonably acceptable to Saehan (the
" _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ") entered into at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, to deliver an aggregate number of shares of Wilshire Common
Stock that is equal to the Total Stock Amount and an amount in cash which is
equal to the Total Cash Amount and (b) deposit, or cause to be deposited with,
the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(e) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
shares of Saehan Common Stock whose shares were converted at the Effective
Time into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that, with respect to Certificates, delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates and such letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Wilshire and Saehan may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which such Saehan
Common Stock has been so converted. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal or
submission of a letter of transmittal in respect of Book Entry Shares, as
applicable, duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Saehan Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Saehan Common Stock surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all
shares of Saehan Common Stock then held by such holder), and the Certificate
and Book Entry Shares so surrendered forthwith shall be cancelled. In the
event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making and submission to the Exchange Agent of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may determine in its sole discretion is necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
consideration provided for in this Agreement. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Saehan Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of Saehan, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if a
duly executed letter of transmittal accompanied, in the case of Saehan Common
Stock in certificated form, by the relevant Certificate representing such
Saehan Common Stock, is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or paid with respect to Wilshire Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares of
Wilshire Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in

 



      
 

 



 

lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder of unsurrendered
Certificate or Book Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.3(e), until the holder
of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall have complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in Section 2.3(b). Subject to the effect of Applicable
Legal Requirements, following the surrender of any such Certificate or Book
Entry Shares, there shall be paid to the holder of whole shares of Wilshire
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional
share of Wilshire Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3(e), if applicable, and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
(but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to
such whole shares of Wilshire Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Wilshire
Common Stock.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration issued upon
conversion of shares of Saehan Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (in each case, including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3(c) or
2.3(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Saehan Common Stock, and, at the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Saehan Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or letter of transmittal in respect of Book
Entry Shares, as applicable, is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, the Saehan Common Stock represented thereby or referred to therein
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Wilshire Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Saehan Common Stock, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the
Surviving Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable
Saehan Common Stock by submission of a letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent accompanied by the applicable Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall pay
each holder of such Saehan Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder
(after taking into account all shares of Saehan Common Stock held at the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
Wilshire Average Closing Price.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of Saehan for nine (9) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holders of Saehan Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration to which
they might be entitled, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Wilshire
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Wilshire
Common Stock.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Legal
Requirements, none of Wilshire, Saehan or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Saehan Common Stock for shares of
Wilshire Common Stock, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and
Wilshire shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of
Saehan Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the former holder of the shares of Saehan Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

(c) _Organization and Qualification of the Saehan Trust_. With respect to the
Saehan Trust:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The Saehan Trust has issued and sold preferred securities and common
securities under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (each a "
_Saehan Trust Agreement_ "), and Saehan has issued to the Saehan Trust,
Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes (" _Notes_ "), under an Indenture (the
Saehan Trusts Indenture and Saehan Trust Agreement are collectively referred
to as the " _Saehan Operative Documents_ "). __Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)(i)_
_sets forth, with respect to the Saehan Trust, the (i) date of its Saehan
Trust Agreement and Indenture, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of its
preferred securities, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of its common
securities, (iii) aggregate amount of Notes that have been issued to the
Saehan Trust by Saehan, (iv) the rate paid on its preferred securities, the
common securities and the Notes, (v) date after which Saehan may redeem its
Notes at par, and (vi) maturity date of its Notes.

 



 

(ii) The Saehan Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Delaware with the
power and authority to own property and to conduct the business it transacts
and proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its obligations under
the Saehan Operative Documents. The Saehan Trust is not a party to or
otherwise bound by any material agreement other than the Saehan Operative
Documents and a Placement Agreement of even date with the relevant Saehan
Trust Agreement. The Saehan Trust is and will, under current law, be
classified for federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an
association taxable as a corporation.

 



 

(iii) The preferred securities and the common securities issued by the Saehan
Trust have been duly authorized by the Saehan Trust Agreement, have been
validly issued and represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of
the Saehan Trust. None of the preferred securities or the common securities is
subject to preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding common
securities issued by the Saehan Trust are directly owned by Saehan free and
clear of any pledge, security interest, claim, lien or other encumbrance, and
have been issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities
laws. The common securities issued by the Saehan Trust satisfy the eligibility
requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) issued under the Securities Act. Neither
Saehan nor the Saehan Trust is an "investment company" or an entity
"controlled" by an "investment company," in each case within the meaning of
section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, without regard
to section 3(c) of that act. The Notes are not held of record by stockholders
of Saehan or Saehan Bank.

 



 

(iv) The sole assets of the Saehan Trust are its Notes, any interest paid on
such Notes to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such Notes, or any of
the foregoing.

 



 

(v) All of the proceeds from the sale of the preferred securities issued by
the Saehan Trust have been invested in its Notes. All of the proceeds from the
sale of the common securities issued by the Saehan Trust have been invested in
the Notes. All Notes are and have been held by the Saehan Trust since their
initial issuance.

 



 

(vi) The Saehan Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and the Saehan Trust has not conducted any trade or business
since it was formed. The Saehan Trust exists for the exclusive purposes of (i)
issuing and selling its preferred securities and common securities, (ii) using
the proceeds from the sale of its preferred securities and common securities
to acquire its Notes, and (iii) engaging only in

 



      
 

 



 

activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. The Saehan Trust was
formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of that Saehan Trust, and
the existence of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that purpose.
There is no intent to provide holders of such interests in the Saehan Trust
with diverse interests in the assets of that Saehan Trust.

 



 

(vii) Except as set forth on __Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)(vii)__ , Saehan has
made timely payments of all installments of principal and interest on, and
performed all of its other obligations under, the Notes. Except as set forth
on __Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)(vii)__ , Saehan has not exercised its right to
defer interest payments on any of the Notes. Except as set forth on
__Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)(vii)__ , Saehan has not been advised by the
Federal Reserve or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to defer interest
payments on any of the Notes, nor does Saehan have knowledge of any basis for
the same.

 



 

(viii) The Saehan Trusts income consists solely of payments made by Saehan
with respect to its Notes, and such payments are not derived from the active
conduct of a financial business by the Saehan Trust. Both Saehans obligation
to make those payments and the amounts thereof are set forth in the Notes.
Neither Saehans obligation to make those payments nor the amounts payable by
Saehan is dependent on income or profits of Saehan or any Affiliate of Saehan
(although Saehans ability to do so is so dependent).

 



 

(ix) Saehan has not issued any class of capital shares either _pari passu_ or
senior to the Notes. All Notes are either _pari passu_ or senior to Saehans
trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(x) Saehan and the Saehan Trust have created a debtor-creditor relationship
between Saehan, as debtor, and the Saehan Trust, as a creditor, and Saehan and
the Saehan Trust have treated the Notes as indebtedness for all tax purposes.

 



 

(xi) Each Saehan Operative Document entered into by Saehan or any of its
Subsidiaries is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid, binding
and legally enforceable obligation of Saehan or one of its Subsidiaries, and
to the knowledge of Saehan, the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equitable principles,
including good faith, commercial reasonableness, forthright negotiation and
fair dealing).

 



 

(d) _Authority_.

 



 

(i) Saehan has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and subject, in the case of the consummation of the

applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and remedies and to
general equitable principles, forthright negotiation, commercial
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

 



 

(ii) The execution and delivery by Saehan of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation by Saehan of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not, (A)

of Saehan or its Subsidiaries (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to

stock option or right was granted, as determined by Saehan in good faith and

Benefit Plan (other than ordinary course claims for benefits) and, to the
knowledge of Saehan none are threatened. Except as disclosed on Disclosure

employee, officer, former employee or former officer of Saehan.

 



 

(ix) Except as required by the continuation coverage requirements of Section
601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or comparable State law,
neither Saehan nor any Subsidiary of Saehan has any liability to provide post-

employee of Saehan or any Saehan Subsidiary promising or guaranteeing any
employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life or
disability coverage for such individual, their

 



      
 

 



 

dependents, or any beneficiaries for any period of time beyond the end of the
current plan year or beyond termination of employment, except as required by
law and at no expense to Saehan.

 



 

(x) Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule 3.1(l)(x), no Saehan Benefit
Plan, Saehan Stock Plan or other contract or arrangement exists that could
result in the payment to any present or former employee or director of Saehan
or any Subsidiary of Saehan of any money or other property or accelerate or

otherwise compensate any Person because of the limits contained in such Code
sections.

(d) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be included
by Wilshire by reference in the Form S-4 shall at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented and at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at
the time of the Saehan Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact respecting Wilshire required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If
Wilshire becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of
the statements in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, Wilshire will promptly inform Saehan thereof. The representations
and warranties in this subsection (d) shall not apply to statements in or
omissions from the Form S-4 or any amendment thereto or the Proxy

upon and in conformity with information furnished to Wilshire by Saehan in
writing, in each case expressly for use therein.

preemptive rights. Wilshire Bank is an "insured bank" as defined in the FDIA
and applicable regulations thereunder. Wilshire Bank is a California-state
chartered nonmember bank whose primary federal bank regulator is the FDIC.

 



 

(f) _Brokers or Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or Person is or shall be entitled to any brokers or
finders fee or any other similar commission or fee in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except Macquarie Capital

indemnify Saehan and to hold Saehan harmless from and against any and all
claims, liabilities or obligations with respect to any other fees, commissions
or expenses asserted by any Person on the basis of any act or statement
alleged to have been made by Saehan or its affiliates.

 



 

(g) Neither Wilshire nor any Wilshire Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take
(or failed to take or agree to take) any action or knows of any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

 



 

(j) _Agreements with Regulators_. Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule
3.2(j), neither Wilshire nor any Subsidiary of Wilshire is a party or subject
to any written agreement, consent decree or memorandum of understanding with,

any Governmental Entity arising under applicable laws which would be required
to be disclosed in any regulatory filing, and no such disciplinary proceeding
or order is pending, nor, to the knowledge of Wilshire, threatened.

 **ARTICLE V 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

Section 5.1. _Preparation of Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders
Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Saehan
shall prepare acceptable preliminary and definitive information relating to
the proxy materials which shall constitute the proxy statement/prospectus
relating to the matters to be submitted to the Saehan stockholders at the
Saehan Stockholders Meeting and the solicitation of the Required Saehan Vote
(such proxy statement/prospectus, and all amendments, supplements, annexes and
exhibits thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and Wilshire shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Saehan with respect to the issuance of Wilshire
Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Form S-4_"). Wilshire shall use reasonable best efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective by order of the SEC as promptly as is
reasonably practicable and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Wilshire shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof, provide Saehan with copies of all written comments and advise Saehan
of all oral comments with respect to the Form S-4 received from the staff of
the SEC. Wilshire shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and all applicable foreign and state securities and "blue sky" laws in
connection with the Merger and the issuance of Wilshire Common Stock in
connection with the Merger and each Party shall furnish all information
concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Wilshire shall advise Saehan,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective, the filing of each supplement or amendment thereto, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the
qualification of the Wilshire Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of

 



      
 

 



 

or supplement to the Form S-4, SEC comments thereon, whether written or oral,
or SEC requests for additional information or materials. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to either of the Parties, or
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
either Party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Form S-4 so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify and consult with the other Party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, shall cooperate with the other Party (including
giving due consideration to the comments received from the other Party) to
provide that an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Saehan and Wilshire. Saehan shall cooperate and assist
Wilshire in preparing the Form S-4, including furnishing to Wilshire all
information concerning Saehan that Wilshire may reasonably request in
connection with preparation of such Form S-4. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Saehan or Wilshire or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents for inclusion or in the Form S-4 shall, at the
date the Form S-4 is declared effective, at the time the Form S-4 may be
amended or supplemented, and at the time of Saehan Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact with respect to Saehan or Wilshire, as the case may be, necessary in
order to make the statements therein with respect to Saehan or Wilshire, as
the case may be, in light of the circumstances under which they are made not
misleading.

 



 

(b) Saehan shall duly take all lawful action to establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the Form S-4
becomes effective (the " _Saehan Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
submitting this Agreement to the holders of Saehan Common Stock for their
consideration and vote and obtaining the Required Saehan Vote. Subject to
Section 5.1(d), and as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
on which the Form S-4 becomes effective, the Saehan Board shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from the Saehan
stockholders the Required Saehan Vote, and Saehan shall take all other lawful
action necessary or advisable (including, subject to the Saehan Boards
exercise of its fiduciary duties, postponing or adjourning the Saehan
Stockholders Meeting to make any communication permitted by this Agreement or
to obtain a quorum or to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement) to obtain the Required Saehan Vote. Subject to Section
5.1(d), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Saehan Board
Recommendation.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 5.1(d), neither the Saehan Board nor any committee
thereof shall (u) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify the Saehan Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Wilshire (it being understood that the
failure of the Saehan Board Recommendation to be unanimous shall constitute a
withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification that is adverse to
Wilshire unless the failure to be unanimous is solely because a director is
not present for the vote due to incapacity or because he is not reasonably
available to attend a meeting), (v) adopt a resolution to withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify the Saehan Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Wilshire, (w) publicly announce its intention to withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify the Saehan Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Wilshire, (x)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Saehan,
(y) cause, authorize or permit Saehan or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement-in-principle,
merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal,

 



      
 

 



 

other than (1) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as provided in Section
5.4(b) or (2) a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal
pursuant to Section 5.1(f)(i)(G), or (z) publicly propose or announce an
intention to take any of the foregoing actions described in the foregoing
clauses (u) through (y) (a " _Saehan Change in Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.1,
but subject to the provisions of this Section 5.1(d), at any time prior to
receipt of the Required Saehan Vote, the Saehan Board may effect or cause
Saehan to effect, a Saehan Change in Recommendation, if the Saehan Board
reasonably determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to
make a Saehan Change in Recommendation would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties of the Saehan Board to the stockholders of Saehan under
Applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Saehan Board shall not make a Saehan Change in Recommendation, and, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1(d), unless: (A) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited,
bona fide written offer to effect an Acquisition Proposal is made to Saehan
(Saehan under such circumstances being referred to herein as the " _Target
Party_ ," and the other Party under such circumstances being referred to
herein as the " _Non-Target Party_ ") and is not withdrawn; (B) such
unsolicited, bona fide, written offer was not obtained or made in violation of
Section 5.4; (C) the Target Party has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under Section 5.4, including its obligations to provide
notice(s) to the Non-Target Party of any Acquisition Proposal and other
matters requiring notice under Section 5.4; (D) at least three (3) Business
Days prior to any intended meeting of the board of directors of the Target
Party at which such board of directors intends to consider and determine
whether to make a Change in Recommendation, the Target Party provides the Non-
Target Party with a written notice specifying the date and time of such
intended meeting, the reasons for convening such intended meeting, the
material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of
the intended meeting at which the board of directors of the Target Party will
consider a Change in Recommendation (the " _Target Offer_ ") (including a copy
of any draft agreement reflecting the Target Offer, if any) and the identity
of the Person making the Target Offer (it being agreed that any substantive
change to the terms and conditions of the Target Offer shall require a new
notice and three (3) Business Day period); (E) after receipt by the Non-Target
Party of the information and notice described in clause (D), the Non-Target
Party notifies the Target Party of its desire to negotiate an amendment to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and during such three (3) Business Day
period, the Parties engage in good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that, after giving effect to such amendment(s), the Target
Partys board of directors may conclude that the Target Offer does not
constitute a Superior Proposal; (F) at the end of such three (3) Business Day
period, the Target Partys board of directors (x) concludes, after and taking
into account any amendment(s) to this Agreement proposed by the Non-Target
Party during such three (3) Business Day period, that such Target Offer is a
Superior Proposal, and (y) determines in good faith, After Consultation, that
the failure by the board of directors of the Target Party to make a Change in
Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements; and (G) the Target Party
thereafter enters into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal and concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(e), and pays to the Non-Target Party the Termination Fee required by
Section 7.2(b).

 



 

Section 5.2. _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, Saehan shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford to the representatives of Wilshire and Newco, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such

 



      
 

 



 

period, Saehan shall (and shall cause Subsidiaries to) make available to
Wilshire and Newco (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws, federal or state banking
laws or the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations (other than
reports or documents which such Party is not permitted to disclose under
Applicable Legal Requirements) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Wilshire and Newco may reasonably
request.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall hold all information which is nonpublic in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter
dated as of June 5, 2013, among Saehan and Wilshire (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect until immediately following the Effective Time. Newco acknowledges and
agrees to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were Wilshire
for purposes thereof.

 



 

(c) No such investigation by either Wilshire or Saehan shall affect the
representations and warranties of any Party expressly made in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.3. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Each of Saehan and Wilshire shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the Bank Merger and make
effective the other transactions contemplated herein as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to comply promptly with all Applicable Legal Requirements which may
be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and
the Bank Merger and to consummate the Merger and the Bank Merger, and (ii) to
obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and/or any other public or private third party which is required to be
obtained or made by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Applicable Legal Requirements or any contract or other obligation in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that a Party shall not be obligated to
take any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or such
compliance or the obtaining of such consent, authorization, order, approval or
exemption shall result in a condition or restriction on such Party or on the
Surviving Corporation having an effect of the type referred to in Section
6.1(f). In furtherance and not in limitation of the Parties obligations under
this Section 5.3, each of the Parties further agrees as follows:

 



 

(i) Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement, each of Saehan
and Wilshire shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable

stock of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its voting

stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning securities representing 20%
or more of the total voting power of it (or of the surviving parent entity in
such transaction) or of any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or
transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by the other Party or an

respects by Wilshire with the other terms of this Section 5.4, to engage in
discussions or negotiations with, and provide nonpublic information to, any
Person who has submitted and not withdrawn an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from
a breach of Section 5.4(a) if the Saehan Board concludes in good faith, After
Consultation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that such Party
(i) first enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) provides
Wilshire at least 24 hours prior written notice before engaging in any such
discussions or negotiations or providing information to such Person and (iii)
thereafter keeps Wilshire promptly and fully informed on a current basis of

and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any expressions of
interest, offers, proposals, requests or inquiries (including a copy thereof
if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence, if any).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Saehan agrees that (i) it shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
request each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement with such Party in connection with the consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal, to return or destroy all confidential information or
data heretofore furnished to such Person, (ii) it shall enforce (and not
release any third party from or waive) any provisions of, any confidentiality,
standstill, non-solicitation or similar agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) it
shall not take any action to render inapplicable or to exempt any Person from
Section 1203 of the CGCL or any other antitakeover statute, charter provision

Saehan agrees that the Saehan Benefit Plans may be terminated, modified or

determined by Wilshire in its sole discretion, subject to compliance with
applicable law so long as any such action does not reduce any benefits already
accrued thereunder. At the request of Wilshire, Saehan and its Subsidiaries
agree to terminate no later than immediately before the Closing Date any
Saehan Benefit Plans for which Saehan may have liability, to the extent such
Saehan Benefit Plans permit termination so that Saehan will have no liability
from and after the Closing Date, and Saehan will accrue any and all
obligations with respect to the termination of such plans before the Closing
Date. Wilshire acknowledges that any termination or modification at the
direction of Wilshire will not (a) be deemed to cause the Saehan Financial
Statements to have been prepared other than in accordance with GAAP, (b)
constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Saehan or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated,

transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such

cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on Party in
connection with the Merger, and (b) the filing fees and printing and mailing
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Proxy

and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Saehan or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages,

 



      
 

 



 

costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of
Saehan or any Subsidiary of Saehan, and pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by Saehan pursuant to the Saehan Charter and Saehans
bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof
with any directors, officers and employees of Saehan and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Saehan (provided
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to
the extent such premiums exceed 250% of the premiums paid as of the date
hereof by Saehan for such insurance (" _Saehan s Current Premium_"), and if
such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of Saehans
Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to 250% of Saehans Current Premium. In lieu of the foregoing, Saehan,
in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Wilshire, may obtain on or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy or "extended discovery
period" under Saehans existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that does not
exceed Saehans Current Premium.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnified Party for all
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an
Indemnified Party may incur in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for in this Section 5.8.

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent required by
Applicable Legal Requirements or the requirements of any listing agreement

(b) to provide that all press releases and other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such
joint communications plan, and (c) to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public

transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the
extent required by Applicable Legal Requirements or the requirements of any
listing agreement with or rules of NASDAQ, neither Wilshire nor Saehan shall

Section 5.10. _Tax Matters_. (a) Saehan and Wilshire each shall not, and shall
not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action,

368(a) of the Code and (b) Saehan and Wilshire each agree to file all tax
returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Untrue Representations_. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party in writing if such party becomes aware of any fact or condition
that makes untrue, or shows to have been untrue, any schedule or any other
information furnished to the other party or any representation or warranty
made in or pursuant to this Agreement or that results in such partys failure
to comply with any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Wilshire and Newco, on the one
hand, or Newco and Saehan, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other
of any legal action, suit or proceeding or judicial, administrative or
governmental investigation, pending or, to the knowledge of the notifying
Person, threatened against the notifying Person that questions or might
question the validity of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or any actions taken or to be taken by the notifying Person pursuant
hereto or seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Saehan shall
give Wilshire the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against Saehan or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Saehan shall not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of
any stockholder litigation against Saehan or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without Wilshires prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Closing, Saehan agrees to provide Wilshire with supplemental disclosure
schedules reflecting any material changes thereto between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date. Delivery of such supplemental disclosure

this Agreement. Any information set forth in any one section of the Saehan or
Wilshire disclosure schedules shall be deemed to apply to each other
applicable section or subsection of the Saehan or Wilshire disclosure
schedules, respectively, if its relevance to the information called for in
such section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face notwithstanding
the omission of any cross-reference to such other section.

instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective board of directors,

any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
breaches in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements, covenants or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of a
Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any
subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege

inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this
Agreement has been relied upon or made by any of the Parties. Except as
provided in Section 5.8 , this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any breaches in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without notice or
liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties and
may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of
this Agreement. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any employee benefit plan of Saehan, Wilshire or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by either of them, (ii) alter
or limit the ability of Saehan, Wilshire, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any employee
benefit plan maintained by any of them, (iii) confer upon any current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to employment or
continued employment or continued service with Saehan, Wilshire or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or constitute or create an
employment agreement with or for any individual, or (iv) alter or limit the
ability of Saehan, Wilshire or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to make necessary or appropriate changes to their respective
businesses in response to changed circumstances, unforeseen events or the
like. The disclosure in any correspondingly identified subsection of the
disclosure schedules delivered by Saehan or Wilshire, as applicable, shall
qualify (i) the corresponding subsection of this Agreement and (ii) the other
Sections or subsections of this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies
to such other Sections or subsections.

 



 

Section 8.7. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only as broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 8.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by either
of the Parties (whether by operation

 



      
 

 



 

of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party, and
any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements, be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 8.9. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, and all disputes
between the Parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and
circumstances leading to its execution or performance, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California, without reference to the conflict of laws
principles thereof.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of all state and federal courts sitting in the State of
California, including to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may
be taken from such courts, in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any facts and circumstances leading to its execution or
performance, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, suit
or proceeding must be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the State
of California, (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such courts,
(iv) agrees not to bring any action, suit or proceeding against the other
Party or its Affiliates arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any facts and circumstances
leading to its execution or performance in any other courts and (v) waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action, suit or
proceeding so brought. Each of the Parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or
other security that might be required of any other Party with respect to any
such action, suit or proceeding, including any appeal thereof.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in accordance with Section 8.3 shall be effective service of process
for any action, suit or proceeding brought against it by the other Party in
connection with Section 8.9(b), provided that nothing contained herein shall
affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.10. _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable injury, for
which damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving actual
monetary loss or posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court identified in Section 8.10, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 8.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY DISPUTE WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY

 



      
 

 



 

HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

 **EXHIBIT B**

 



 

 ** _VOTING AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This **VOTING AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT** (the " _Agreement_ ") is made
and entered into as of the 15th day of July, 2013, by and between **WILSHIRE
BANCORP, INC.**, a California corporation and registered bank holding company
(" _Wilshire_ "), **SAEHAN BANCORP** , a California corporation and registered
bank holding company (" _Saehan_ ") and ,
a director ("Director") of Saehan.

 



 

 ** _WITNESSETH:_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Wilshire, WS Merger Acquisition Corp., a newly formed, wholly
owned subsidiary of Wilshire (" _Newco_ ") and Saehan have entered into that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of July 15,
2013, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Saehan will be merged
with and into Newco, with Newco surviving (the " _Merger_ "). Terms with their
initial letter capitalized and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings given them in the Merger Agreement; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Director understands and acknowledges that Directors execution
and delivery of this Agreement is a material inducement to Wilshire and Saehan
to enter into the Merger Agreement and a condition to Wilshires obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the Merger and the premises and
mutual covenants contained herein and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Wilshire, Saehan and Director agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Director Support_. Director agrees to use his reasonable efforts to support and refrain from harming the goodwill of Wilshire and its subsidiaries (" _Wilshire Subsidiaries_ ") and Saehan and its subsidiaries (" _Saehan Subsidiaries_ "), and their respective customer and client relationships. Director further agrees to support the business and banking reputation of Wilshire, including its subsidiaries, and not to disparage or otherwise malign such business or banking reputation.

 



 

2. _Director Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Director agrees that for a period of two (2) years from the date of this
Agreement, Director shall not, directly or indirectly, individually or as an
employee, partner, officer, director, promoter or shareholder or in any other
capacity whatsoever, except in the performance of customary legal, accounting
or investment or investment management services as performed at the time of
execution of the Agreement or of a similar nature:

 



 

(i) solicit the banking business of any current customers of Saehan or the
Saehan Subsidiaries; or

 



 

(ii) (A) acquire, charter, operate or enter into any franchise or other
management agreement with any "Financial Institution," as defined

 



 

Exhibit B - 1     
 

 



 

below, in which Director shall be involved in activities competitive with
Wilshire or the Wilshire Subsidiaries, or Saehan or the Saehan Subsidiaries,
in each case as in existence as of the date hereof (B) serve as an officer,
director, employee, agent, promoter, or consultant to any Financial
Institution (whether in existence or in organization) in connection with
activities that are competitive with Wilshire or any Wilshire Subsidiaries, or
Saehan or the Saehan Subsidiaries, in each case as in existence as of the date
hereof, or (C) establish or operate a branch or other office of a Financial
Institution, provided that the restrictions in clauses (A) though (C) above
shall apply only to any Financial Institution located within a 10-mile radius
of any branch of Wilshire State Bank or Saehan Bank, in each case as in
existence as of the date hereof (" _Covered Financial Institution_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Financial Institution_ " means a "depository
institution" as that term is defined in 12 C.F.R. Section 348.2 and any parent
or subsidiary thereof.

 



 

(b) Director further agrees that Director shall not:

 



 

(i) prior to the Effective Date of the Merger, recruit, hire, assist others in
recruiting or hiring, discuss employment with, or refer others concerning
employment, any person who is, or within the preceding twelve (12) months was,
an employee of Saehan or any Saehan Subsidiary; and

 



 

(ii) after the Effective Date of the Merger and until the second anniversary
of this Agreement, recruit, hire, assist others in recruiting or hiring,
discuss employment with, or refer others concerning employment, any person who
is an employee of Wilshire or any Wilshire Subsidiary at the time and who was
an employee of Saehan within the preceding twelve (12) months.

 



 

(c) If any court of competent jurisdiction should determine that any term or
terms of this covenant are too broad with respect to time, geographic area,
lines of commerce or otherwise, such court shall modify and revise any such
term or terms so that they comply with applicable law.

 



 

(d) Director agrees that (i) this Agreement is entered into in connection with
the conveyance to Wilshire of the goodwill of the business of Saehan and the
Saehan Subsidiaries; (ii) Director is receiving valuable consideration in this
Agreement and in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (iii) the
restrictions imposed upon Director by this Agreement are essential and
necessary to ensure that Wilshire receives the goodwill of Saehan and the
Saehan Subsidiaries; and (iv) all the restrictions (including particularly the
time and geographical limitations) set forth in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable.

 



 

Exhibit B - 2     
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Director to (i) divest any passive investment in any Covered Financial
Institution existing as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, (ii) refrain
from becoming a shareholder of no more than 4.9% of any class of equity
security or debt security or other ownership interest of any Covered Financial
Institution, or (iii) resign from any board position held at any Covered
Financial Institution as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. In the event
that the Director holds a passive investment, becomes a shareholder or serves
on a board of a Covered Financial Institution as outlined in this paragraph
2(e), such Director will still be subject to the duties outlined in paragraphs
2(a) and 2(b) above.

 



 

(f) Director agrees, following the date hereof until this Agreement
terminates, not to take any action that would make any representation or
warranty of Director contained herein untrue or incorrect or have or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, impeding or
interfering with or adversely affecting the performance by Director of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Director agrees to permit Wilshire and/or Saehan to publish and disclose
in any proxy statement or securities filing, Directors identity and ownership
of shares of Saehans or Wilshires common stock and the nature of Directors
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

 



 

(h) From time to time, at the request of Wilshire and without further
consideration, Director shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

3. _Release_.

 



 

(a) Director acknowledges that he has no existing claims or defenses, personal
or otherwise, or rights of set off whatsoever against Saehan, except as
expressly provided herein. For and in consideration of the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
Director, for himself and on behalf of his heirs and assigns (the "Director
Releasing Parties"), releases, acquits and forever discharges Saehan and its
Subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors,
employees, agents and servants, and all persons, natural or corporate, in
privity with them or any of them, from any and all claims or causes of action
of any kind whatsoever, at common law, statutory or otherwise, which the
Director Releasing Parties, or any of them, has, known or unknown, now
existing or that may hereafter arise in respect of any and all agreements and
obligations incurred on or prior to the date hereof, or in respect of any
event occurring or circumstances existing on or prior to the date hereof;
_provided, however_ , that Saehan and its Subsidiaries shall not be released
from any obligations or liabilities to Director in connection with any
deposits, accounts, fees, accrued benefits or other written contractual
obligations of Saehan to Director as set forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto
or any potential claim for indemnification under Saehans articles of
incorporation or bylaws (in each case as in existence on the date hereof) for
any matters arising in connection with the Directors service as a director or
officer of Saehan or any Saehan Subsidiary relating to acts, circumstances,
actions or omissions

 



 

Exhibit B - 3     
 

 



 

arising on or prior to the date hereof to the extent such claims have not been
asserted or are not known to Director.

 



 

(b) Director expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits
afforded by Section 1542 of the California Civil Codeand any similar federal
law or law of any other jurisdictionand does so understanding and
acknowledging the significance and consequence of such specific waiver of
Section 1542. Section 1542 of the California Civil Code states as follows:

 



 

 **"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT
KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."**

 



 

Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, and for the purpose of
implementing a full and complete release, Director expressly acknowledges that
the release above is intended to include in its effect, without limitation,
any and all claims which Director does not know or suspect to exist in his
favor at the time of execution hereof, and that this Agreement contemplates
the extinguishment of such claims.

 



 

(c) It is expressly understood and agreed that the terms hereof are
contractual and not merely recitals, and that the agreements herein contained
and the consideration herein transferred is to compromise doubtful and
disputed claims, and that no releases made or other consideration given hereby
or in connection herewith shall be construed as an admission of liability, all
liability being expressly denied by Saehan and the Saehan Subsidiaries.
Director hereby represents and warrants that the consideration hereby
acknowledged for entering into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby is greater than the value of all claims, demands, actions
and causes of action herein relinquished, released, renounced, abandoned,
acquitted, waived and/or discharged, and that this Agreement is in full
settlement, satisfaction and discharge of any and all such claims, demands,
actions, and causes of action that Director may have or be entitled to against
Saehan and its Subsidiaries, and its predecessors, assigns, legal
representatives, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents other
than obligations or liabilities to Director in connection with any deposits,
accounts, fees, accrued benefits or other written contractual obligations of
Saehan and its Subsidiaries to Director as set forth on _Schedule 2_ attached
hereto.

 



 

4. _Termination_. Subject to the second sentence of Section 5, this Agreement shall terminate following the end of the noncompete period described in Section 2(a) above, except for liabilities or claims that shall have arisen or accrued on or before such termination.

 



 

5. _Effective Date_. This Agreement shall become effective on the date of execution of this Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, then this

 



 

Exhibit B - 4     
 

 



 

Agreement shall become null and void as of the date of the termination of the
Merger Agreement and shall be of no further force and effect.

 



 

6. _Specific Performance/Injunctive Relief_. Director acknowledges that performance of the terms of this Agreement constitute valuable, special and unique property of Wilshire critical to the business of Wilshire and Wilshire Bank and that any breach of this Agreement by Director will give rise to irreparable injury that is not compensable with money damages. Accordingly, Director agrees that Wilshire shall be entitled to obtain specific performance and/or injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Director. Wilshire and Director hereby acknowledge and agree that Wilshire and Saehan will be irreparably damaged if the provisions of this Agreement are not specifically enforced. Director further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other security or the proof of actual damages in connection with such remedies. Such remedies shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedy that Wilshire may have at law or in equity.

 



 

7. _Extension of Term of Restrictive Covenant_. If Director violates any restrictive covenant contained in Section 2, or if any action to enforce a restrictive covenant contained in Section 2 is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, then the term of such restrictive covenant will be extended by adding to it the number of days that Directors violation continues and the number of days during which such court action is pending. If there are both a violation and a pending court action, then the number of days that each continues will be added to the term of such restrictive covenants, but days on which both continue will be counted only once.

 



 

8. _Voting Agreement_.

This **VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT** (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into by and between **WILSHIRE BANCORP, INC.**, a California corporation ("
_Wilshire_ "), and (" _Shareholder_ ").
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to
them in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **R E C I T A L S:**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Wilshire, WS Merger Acquisition Corp., a newly formed
subsidiary of Wilshire (" _Newco_ "), and Saehan Bancorp, a California
corporation (" _Saehan_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") providing for the merger of Saehan
with and into Newco, with Newco as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, Shareholder is the record and beneficial
owner of the number of shares of Saehan Common Stock set forth on _Attachment
A_ hereto; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as an inducement and a condition to Wilshire entering into and
consummating the Merger Agreement, Wilshire has required that Shareholder
enter into this Agreement so as to make more likely the approval of the Merger
by the requisite vote of Saehans shareholders and to promote stability
between Wilshire and its substantial shareholders following consummation of
the Merger;

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants
and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

Shareholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and shall vote (or cause
to be voted) all of its voting shares of capital stock of Saehan entitled to
vote at such meeting, including all voting shares listed on _Attachment A_
(together, " _Owned Shares_ "): (a) in favor of approval of (1) the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (2) any other matter that
is required to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (3) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later

(b) against any action or agreement that would impair the ability of Wilshire
to complete the

be inconsistent with, prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the

this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that Wilshire would be irreparably harmed if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in
such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which Wilshire may be entitled (including
monetary damages), Wilshire shall be

 



 

Exhibit C - 6     
 

 



 

entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. Shareholder further
agrees that neither Wilshire nor any other person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 4.08, and
Shareholder irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,

Reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of July 15, 2013 (" _Merger Agreement_ "), by and
between Wilshire Bancorp, Inc. (" _Wilshire_ "), WS Merger Acquisition Corp.,
a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Wilshire (" _Newco_ "), and Saehan
Bancorp (" _Saehan_ "), pursuant to which among other things, subject to the
terms and conditions stated therein, (a) Saehan will be merged with and into
Newco, with Newco surviving the merger, and (b) the shareholders of Saehan
common stock, no par value per share (" _Saehan Common Stock_ "), are to
receive the merger consideration described therein in connection with the
merger of Saehan into Newco. Terms with their initial letter capitalized and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given them in the Merger
Agreement.

 



 

I have previously been granted options to acquire shares of Saehan Common
Stock, pursuant to one or more stock option agreements (the " _Option
Agreements_ ") between Saehan and me. With respect to the number of shares of
Saehan Common Stock that I have unexercised options to purchase (the "
_Covered Options_ "), I acknowledge and agree that upon consummation of the
merger described above (the " _Effective Time_ "), my Covered Options shall be
terminated with no further action necessary on my part and, in consideration
therefor, I shall receive,: in lieu of each share of Saehan Common Stock that
would otherwise have been issuable upon exercise of my Covered Options, an
amount in cash equal to (a) the weighted average sales price per share for
Saehan Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board on the Closing Date (or, in the
event fewer than 100,000 shares of Saehan Common Stock traded on the OTC
Bulletin Board on the Closing Date, the Per Share Cash Consideration as stated
in the Merger Agreement), less (b) the exercise price per share with respect
to the corresponding Saehan Stock Option in question (the " _Per Option
Termination Consideration_ "). I acknowledge that the consideration to be
received by me pursuant to this letter agreement is adequate consideration for
my agreement to the terms and conditions of this letter agreement, including,
without limitation, the release set forth below.

 



 

Exhibit D - 1     
 

 



 

I hereby agree not to exercise any of my Covered Options before the Effective
Time. I further agree (a) to accept the Per Option Termination Consideration
for each Covered Option in full satisfaction of all my rights under the
Covered Options, and (b) that, without limitation, subject to receipt of the
Per Option Termination Consideration for each Covered Option, such Covered
Options will be cancelled and will terminate at the Effective Time.

 



 

Anything provided to the contrary in this Agreement or the Option Agreements
notwithstanding, I acknowledge and agree that at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Wilshire may determine to assume the Covered Options in which
event the Covered Options will be converted into options to purchase the
common stock of Wilshire on the same vesting and exercise terms as the Covered
Options, provided that the number of shares of Wilshire common stock
purchasable pursuant to the Covered Options and the exercise price of the
Covered Options will be adjusted as provided in Section 2.1(c) of the
Agreement. In such event I will receive options to purchase the common stock
of Wilshire in lieu of the Per Option Termination Consideration.

 



 

Upon receipt of the Per Option Termination Consideration for each Covered
Option, I hereby release Wilshire, Saehan, and their respective subsidiaries,
boards of directors, agents, attorneys, stockholders, successors and assigns
from any and all obligations to me relating to the Covered Options. I further
agree to take such additional actions and deliver such additional documents
and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Wilshire or Saehan to
effect the transactions described in this Agreement.

 



 

In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated by Wilshire, Saehan or Newco
in accordance with its terms, this letter agreement shall automatically
terminate and none of the parties hereto shall have any further liability or
obligation to the other(s) with respect to the subject matter hereof in
connection with the Covered Options.

 



 

I understand and agree that the consideration to be received by me pursuant to
this letter agreement will be subject to applicable federal withholding
obligations and reporting.
