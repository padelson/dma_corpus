Section 3.3 _ Post-_ _Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a)    Purchaser shall have ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (the
"Review Period") to review the Closing Statement and related computations of
the Estimated Leakage and the Estimated Transaction Expenses, together with
information Purchaser reasonably requests from Seller   in order to
calculate the actual Leakage between the Locked Box Date and the Closing Date
and for the actual  amount of Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date. If
Purchaser has accepted the Closing Statement in writing or has not given
written notice to Seller   within the Review Period setting forth any
objection of Purchaser to the calculation of Leakage between the Locked Box
Date and the Closing Date and the Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date
(a "Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
then the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Any
Statement of Objections given by Purchaser shall specify in reasonable detail
each item that Purchaser   disputes, the amount in dispute and the reasons
supporting Purchaser's position.

 

(b)    In the event that Purchaser delivers a Statement of Objections during
the Review Period, Purchaser  and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such disputed item in writing within thirty (30) days following
the receipt by Seller of the Statement of Objections (the "Consultation
Period"). Any such disputed items that are resolved by Seller and Purchaser
during the Consultation Period shall be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to appeal. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach an
agreement in writing as to any such objection(s) within the Consultation
Period, then either Seller or Purchaser may submit such matter to any "Big
Four" accounting firm to be  reasonably agreed by Seller and Purchaser;
_provided_ that such accounting firm must not be the independent auditor of
either Purchaser, Seller or the Target Companies and must be reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Seller and that if no such accounting firm is able
or willing to serve in such role or Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree
on an accounting firm within thirty (30) days of receipt by Seller of a
Statement of Objections then the International Chamber of Commerce shall
appoint an accounting firm (in either case, such accountant, the "Settlement
Accountant") ( _provided_ that if Purchaser and Seller cannot agree on an
accountant within thirty (30)  days of receipt by Seller of a Statement of
Objections, then the International Chamber of Commerce shall appoint  the
Settlement Accountant) for resolution of the remaining disputed matters. The
Settlement Accountant shall act  as an expert (and not an arbitrator) and
shall only consider those items that are identified on the Statement of
Objections as in dispute unless otherwise agreed during the Consultation
Period. Within five (5) days of the appointment of the Settlement Accountant,
the Settlement Accountant shall set a schedule for written submissions, which
submissions shall be transmitted simultaneously to the Settlement  Accountant
and Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be. The Settlement Accountant will
have the right to request information and ask questions, _provided_ that
neither Purchaser nor Seller may participate in ex parte communications with
the Settlement Accountant. The Settlement Accountant's determination shall be
consistent with the definitions of Leakage and Transaction Expenses contained
herein. Seller and  Purchaser shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Settlement Accountant to resolve  all
disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) days
after the submission of any dispute to the Settlement Accountant. The
Settlement Accountant's determination shall be made solely in accordance with
the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement   and based solely on
the submissions and supporting materials provided by Purchaser and Seller in
accordance with  the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). The Settlement   Accountant may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either  Party. The resolution of the dispute by the Settlement Accountant
shall be final, binding and nonappealable on the Parties, absent a manifest
error or fraud. The costs and expenses of the Settlement Accountant shall be
borne by Seller in the proportion that the aggregate Reais amount of the items
that are successfully disputed by Purchaser (as finally determined by the
Settlement Accountant) bears to the aggregate Reais amount of the items
submitted to the  Settlement Accountant and by Purchaser in the proportion
that the aggregate Reais amount of the disputed items that  are
unsuccessfully disputed by Purchaser (as finally determined by the Settlement
Accountant) bears to the  aggregate Reais amount of the items submitted to
the Settlement Accountant.

business of any Person or other business  organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the entering into of a

respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date and (ii) key
management personnel of or pertaining to the Target Companies for purposes of

indemnifiable by Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Unless otherwise consented
to in  writing by Seller, and prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the

to, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the
Target Companies for any  period prior to and including the Closing Date

of.

by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be obligated
to pay any consideration to any third party from whom a consent, approval  or

or other assistance to or participate in or be connected with, as a partner,
stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any Person that provides any services of
the kind  provided by the Target Companies as of the Closing Date in the

(i) owning securities having no more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
voting power of any Person listed on any national securities  exchange;

 

(ii) owning, operating, joining, lending money or rendering financial or other

percent (5%) of the outstanding voting power of such Person;

 

(iii) continuing to operate the businesses conducted as of the date of this
Agreement by Seller or its controlled Affiliates (other than the  Target

Territory following the date of this Agreement; or

 

(iv) acquiring an interest or investing in (including by merger, acquisition,
sale of assets or otherwise) any Person or business; _provided_ that (A) the

commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date,  Seller will not, and will cause its controlled Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction
with any other Person, (i) solicit any employee of any Target Company for the
purpose or with the intent of  soliciting such employee away from or out of

Section 7.18 _ IT Transition_.

 

(a) Immediately following the Closing until the end of the  applicable
Services Period, Seller shall support Purchaser by using commercially
reasonable efforts to continue to  provide the Target Companies with the
software on _Schedule __7.18_ (the "Services"), including any sublicenses
under the licenses  for such software (each license held by Seller for use of
such software, a "License" and  collectively, the "Licenses").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain for the benefit of the Target Companies replacements at the
Closing for the Licenses  described as "Class A Licenses" on _Schedule
__7.18_. Any such License so replaced shall not constitute a  License with
respect to which Services will be provided and as such no fee shall be charged
to Purchaser with respect to such License.

 

(c) The provision of the Services shall commence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate on the date that is six (6) months  following the Closing Date;
_provided_ that Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, terminate the provision
of  services with respect to any License at any time through written notice
to Seller (such six (6) month period, as it may be earlier terminated with
respect to any License, such services' "Services Period"). Purchaser's payment
obligations under _Section  7.18(d)_ shall survive the expiration of the
Services Period until satisfied in full.

 

(d) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, five (5) business days after the date of
the expiration of the last Services Period, the aggregate amount of the fees
set forth on _Schedule __7.18_ calculated on a pro rata basis for the actual
number of days in the Services Period for the  Services provided with respect
to each License, plus with respect to any License terminated early pursuant to
_Section 7.18(c)_ , any costs or expenses incurred by Seller in  connection
with any such early termination (e.g., any fees owed to third parties for the
time period prior to such early termination and the six (6)-month period
following the Closing Date for such early-terminated License). Any payment set
forth  in this section shall be added of any Taxes levied upon the payment in
Brazil, as to neutralize any Brazilian Tax effects incurred by the Seller in
receiving the relevant payment, so that the Seller receives precisely the
amount due after said  taxation.

 


 

 

 

49  


 

 

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall each reasonably cooperate with each other and
provide each other with such information, access and assistance as the other
shall reasonably require to  enable the other to provide or receive the
Services. During the Service Period, Seller shall in good faith use
commercially reasonable efforts to perform Services, including to maintain in
effect the Licenses.

 

(f) The obligations set forth in _Section __7.8(a)_   (Access to Properties,
Books and Records) shall apply mutatis mutandis until  the expiration of the
applicable Services Period to the provision of information by Seller regarding
each License for purposes of Purchaser's and its Representatives' activities
in preparation for the operation of the Target Companies following the 
Closing.

 

(g) To the extent that the performance or receipt of Services hereunder
requires access to a Party or its Affiliates'  intranet or other internal
systems by the other Party or its Affiliates (the "Accessing Group"),  such
access shall be subject to the providing Party's and its Affiliates' policies
and procedures, including security guidelines (including physical security,
network access, internet security, confidentiality and personal data
security  guidelines).

 

(h) The provision of Services shall be subject to any requirements of
applicable Law. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing, and the  Purchaser shall be responsible for
any costs and expenses in connection with any such compliance or consents.

 

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that:

 

(i) Except in connection with Seller's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be liable to Purchaser or
the Target Companies for any  Losses arising out of, resulting from, in
connection with, or relating to, any of the Services or the Licenses;

 

(ii) Purchaser and its Representatives may share information regarding the
Services and the Licenses with service providers solely to the extent
reasonably necessary to prepare for the  operations of the Target Companies
after the Closing, including with the providers of the Licenses (and subject
to customary confidentiality agreements with respect to any non-public
information); and

 

(iii) neither, Seller, the Target Companies nor any of their Affiliates shall
be entitled to participate in any discussions by the Purchaser and its
Representatives with such service  providers to the extent not concerning the
rights or obligations of Seller, the Target Companies or any of their
Affiliates.

(e) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser.

 

Section 9.2 _ Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement under _Section 9.1_ by written notice to the other Party, this
Agreement will become void and there will  be no liability on the part of any

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ and on the  Extended

condition not to be satisfied is issued under or pursuant to the Brazilian
Antitrust Law) and (B) all the  other conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_
were satisfied or waived in accordance therewith, except for such conditions
which by their nature can only be satisfied at the  Closing;

 

(ii) by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ and the  applicable
injunction or other order giving rise to such termination right is issued
under or pursuant to the Brazilian Antitrust Law or other antitrust or
competition laws; or

 

(iii) by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ due to a material breach of
Purchaser's covenants or  agreements under _Section 7.6_ that resulted in the
failure to satisfy the conditions specified in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section
8.1(b)_ (but only if the applicable injunction or other order causing such
condition not to be satisfied  is issued under or pursuant to the Brazilian
Antitrust Law); then, Purchaser shall, concurrently with such termination in
the case of a termination by Purchaser, or within two (2) Business Days
following such termination in the case of a termination  by Seller, pay, or
cause to be paid, to Seller an amount equal to one hundred fifty million Reais
(R$150,000,000) (the "Purchaser Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account  or accounts specified by Seller
within one (1) Business Day of the termination.

 


 

 

 

54  


 

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the provisions of _Section
9.3(a)_ are an integral part of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, without such provisions, the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement and (ii) the Purchaser Termination Fee shall constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except in the case of  Fraud or
willful and material breach, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Seller
with respect to any and all claims arising under or related to this Agreement
in the event this Agreement is terminated in any of the circumstances
described in  _Section 9.3(a)_. If Purchaser fails to pay the Purchaser
Termination Fee when due, Purchaser shall also pay to Seller all of Seller's
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including  reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with all actions to collect the Purchaser Termination Fee. This
_Section 9.3_ shall not limit the right of Seller to seek specific 
performance of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.3_ prior to the
termination of this Agreement or to obtain remedies for any willful breach of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

Indemnified Party (as the case may be) will be  entitled to any
indemnification to the extent such Indemnified Party has been otherwise

claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ and _Section 10.2(d)_
shall not exceed one hundred fifty million Reais (R$150,000,000)  (the
"Indemnification Cap");

 


 

 

 

57  


 

 

(ii) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties unless and until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered
aggregate Losses arising out of a claim (or multiple similar claims arising
out of the same facts and circumstances) in excess of one hundred thousand
Reais (R$100,000), individually, or, in the case of  multiple similar claims,
in the aggregate (each such claim a "Qualifying Loss"); and

 

(iii) Seller shall not be liable to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties unless and until the Indemnified Parties have suffered Qualifying
Losses as a result of breaches in excess of nineteen million, two hundred
thousand Reais (R$19,200,000) in the aggregate (the "Indemnification  
Basket"), in which event Seller shall, subject to the Indemnification Cap, be
liable for all Qualifying Losses (i.e., Seller's liability shall not be
limited to the amount in excess of the Indemnification Basket).

 

(d) The indemnification provided for in _Section 10.3(a)_ (other than any __
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any Purchaser Fundamental
Representation or in the case of Fraud) is subject to the following
limitations:

 

(i) the aggregate amount of all payments made by Purchaser in satisfaction of
claims for indemnification pursuant to _ Section 10.3(a)_ shall not exceed the
Indemnification Cap;

 

(ii) Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties unless and until the Seller Indemnified Parties have  suffered a
Qualifying Loss; and

 

(iii) Purchaser shall not be liable to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties unless and until the Seller Indemnified Parties have suffered 
Qualifying Losses as a result of breaches in excess of the Indemnification
Basket, in which event Purchaser shall, subject to the Indemnification Cap, be
liable for all Qualifying Losses (i.e., Purchaser's liability shall not be
limited to the  amount in excess of the Indemnification Basket).

 

Section 10.5 _ Third Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) The party seeking indemnification under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ ,
as applicable (the "Indemnified Party"),  agrees to give prompt notice in
writing to the Party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any action by any
third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
thereunder. Such notice shall set forth in  reasonable detail such Third
Party Claim and the basis for indemnification and the provisions of this
Agreement  pursuant to which such claim for indemnification is made (taking
into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) and the
amount claimed (to the extent known  or determinable), including copies of
any notices and documents receive by the Indemnified Party. The failure to
timely notify the Indemnifying Party of any such claim shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have  materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party. No additional notice will be required with respect to the matters set
forth on _Schedule __10.2(d)_. The Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party apprised of any significant developments relating to any
Third Party Claim or other claims for indemnification.

 


 

 

 

58  


 

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to, at its option, participate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Section 10.5_ , shall be entitled to control and appoint legal
counsel for such defense. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the  Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for all fees, costs, guarantees and expenses associated with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the notice set  forth in
_Section 10.5(a)_ that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the conduct and control, at
the expense of the  Indemnified Party, the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection  with any criminal Proceeding, (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is
failing to prosecute or defend the Third Party  Claim, or (iv) the amount of
the Third Party Claim, if determined in accordance with the claimant's
demands, would reasonably be expected to result in Losses the majority of
which would not be available for recovery under this Article X. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall always have the right to
control the defense of a Third Party Claim to the extent filed against an
Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.5_ ,
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before
entering into any settlement of such Third  Party Claim; _provided_ that
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such settlement
if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary Losses that are paid in  full by
the Indemnifying Party and (ii) such settlement includes an unconditional
release of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be, from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such  Third Party Claim and does not include any statement as to or
any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may
be. An Indemnified Party may not  settle, or, unless otherwise required by
Law, voluntarily admit to any wrongdoing in connection with, any Third Party
Claim for which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to  participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees
and expenses of such separate counsel (i) to the extent incurred by the
Indemnified Party before the date that the Indemnifying  Party assumes
control of the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) if the Indemnified
Party is advised by counsel that (A) there is a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that would make it
inappropriate  under applicable standards of professional conduct for the
same counsel to conduct the defense of such claim or (B) there may be one or
more material defenses or claims available to the Indemnified Party that are
different from or additional to  those available to the Indemnifying Party
and that could be materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party. In the case of
the foregoing clause (ii), the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified
Party reasonably informed with respect to such  Third Party Claim. In
circumstances where the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses in 
connection therewith.

 


 

 

 

59  


 

 

(f) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such  documentation, records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
and make its officers, directors, managers and employees reasonably available,
as may be reasonably requested in  connection therewith.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have the right to, at its option,
participate in the defense of any third party claim described on _Section
10.2(d)_ and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 10.5_ ,
shall be entitled to control and appoint legal counsel  for such defense.

 

Section 10.6 _ Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under this _Article X_ against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party  Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to
give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail  such claim
and the basis for indemnification and the provisions of this Agreement
pursuant to which such claim for indemnification is made (taking into account
the information then available to the Indemnified Party) and the amount of
Losses (to  the extent known or determinable). Failure to timely notify the
Indemnifying Party of a claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially
and adversely prejudiced  the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
timely disputes its indemnity obligation for any Losses with respect to such
claim, the Parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute for a period of sixty (60) days  and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to _Section 11.13_.

 

Section 10.7 _ Exclusive Remedy; __Fraud_. From and after the Closing except
for the right to seek equitable or injunctive relief pursuant to _ Section
11.3_, disputes under _Section 3.3_ (which will be resolved in accordance with
the dispute resolution  mechanism set forth in _Section 3.3_ ) and claims for
Fraud or willful misconduct, the sole and exclusive recourse of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified  Parties, including any claims
for Losses under this Agreement (and any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto), shall be pursuant to the terms of this _Article X_.

 


 

 

 

60  


 

 

Section 10.8 _ Resolution of Claims_. The amount of indemnification to which
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled under this Article X shall be  determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, (ii) by a
final judgment or decree of a New York Court, or (iii) by any other means to
which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall  agree in
writing. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time
for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or
when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. Within five (5) 
Business Days after the final determination of the amount of any Loss, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of the finally determined Loss in
immediately available funds to a bank account specified in writing by the
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 10.9 _ Tax Treatment of Payments_. Any payment under this _Article X_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes unless otherwise required by  applicable Law.

 

Section 10.10 _Tax Gross Up_. The indemnification obligation set forth in this
_Article X_ shall be added of any Taxes levied upon the payment, return or
reimbursement (whether withheld or due by the party receiving the relevant
payment, return or reimbursement), so as to  neutralize any Tax effects
incurred by the party receiving the relevant payment, return or reimbursement,
so that the relevant Party receives precisely the amount due after said
taxation (gross-up).

 

ARTICLE XI 
  
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 11.1 _ Announcements_.

 

(a) The Parties will consult with each other before issuing press releases or
otherwise making any public statements (other than Seller communicating with
the Company Employees) with  respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Parties shall not issue any such press
release or public statement without the prior approval of the other Party
(which approval will not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed).

 

(b)    The restriction in _Section 11.1(a)_ shall not apply to the extent
the public announcement is  required (i) by Law or any Governmental Authority
or stock exchange rules or regulations (ii) by a Party to enforce the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause (i)
hereof, the Party making the announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party in advance as to its 
form, content and timing. Seller and Purchaser may disclose any information
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby which it deems appropriate in
its reasonable judgment to investors in a manner consistent with past
communications.

 

Section 11.2 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned,  delegated or transferred, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), unless such assignment is
consented to in writing by both Purchaser and Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that following the Closing Date, Purchaser may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder without Seller's consent to one of its Affiliates by
operation of Law  (including merger) or otherwise, so long as (a) such
assignment shall occur upon the written adhesion of the respective assignee to
the terms of this Agreement and (b) no such assignment will relieve Purchaser
or Purchaser Guarantor from their  obligations hereunder. This Agreement and
all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 11.3 _ Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party will be irreparably damaged if this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its terms and that any breach of this Agreement and the
non-consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement would
not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, and except as otherwise set forth in _Section 9.3_ ,  in
addition to any other right or remedy to which a Party may be entitled, at Law
or in equity, the Parties expressly consent to the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
threatened  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement, without the need for proof of actual damages or any requirement
under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief, in accordance  with its terms and to require the other
Party to consummate the Closing as contemplated hereby.

 

Section 11.4 _ Costs and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
each be responsible for their or its own costs, charges and other expenses
incurred in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 11.5 _ Notices_. All notices, demands or other communications to be
given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will

Section 11.6 _ Entire  __Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement set forth the entire agreement among the Parties in  respect of the
sale and purchase of the Transferred Shares and supersede any prior agreement
(whether oral or written) relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Revised Preliminary Non-Binding Offer dated August
16,  2019, between Seller and Purchaser. No Party shall have any claim or
remedy in respect of any statement, representation, warranty or undertaking,
made by or on behalf of the other Party in relation to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  that is not expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 11.7 _ Waivers_. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any
right or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall impair such
right or remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or
preclude its exercise at any subsequent  time, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise of it
or the exercise of any other remedy.

 

Section 11.8 _ Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts (including by portable document format (pdf) or other
electronic means), each of which is an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute  one and the same instrument.

 

Section 11.9 _Amendments_. No amendment to this Agreement shall be valid
unless it is in writing and duly executed by Purchaser and Seller.

 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. Each of the provisions of this Agreement is
severable, and if any such provision  is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction, it shall have
no effect in that respect and the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable  substitute provision
the effect of which is as close to its intended effect as possible.

 

Section 11.11 _Third_ _Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section
7.8_ or _Section 11.17_ , a Person who is not a  Party to this Agreement
shall have no right to enforce any of its terms, and this Agreement is not
intended to give any Person other than the Parties and their permitted assigns
any rights hereunder.

 

Section 11.12 _Governing_ _Law_. This Agreement, and all matters or disputes
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely  within such state, without
regard to conflicts of law principles that would require the application of
the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 11.13 _Dispute Resolution_. Each Party hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) consents and submits  to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of any federal court located in the State of New York or, where such
court does not have jurisdiction, any New York state court, in either case
located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York ("New York
Court"), in respect of any claim, dispute, or difference arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, except as to any dispute under _Article III_
that is required to be decided by the Settlement Accountant; (b) waives, to
the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any objection, including any
objection to the  laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non
conveniens or any right of objection to jurisdiction on account of its place
of incorporation or domicile, which it may now or hereafter have to the
bringing of any such action or proceeding in  any New York Court; (c)
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
11.5_ herein, or in any other manner permitted by applicable law; and (d) 
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. By consenting to service of process as
provided in the preceding sentence, each Party waives, to the fullest extent
it may do so under applicable Law, any right, including a personal right it
may have to service  of process in the manner provided by an international
convention or treaty, including the Inter-American Convention on Letters
Rogatory (and Additional Protocol) or the Hague Convention on the Service
Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents  in Civil or Commercial
Matters, and consents and agrees that it may be effectively served with
process via personal delivery or email delivery of a copy of the summons and
complaint as provided in _Section 11.5_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without prejudice to the  preceding sentences, service of process may also be
effected in any other manner that satisfies the legal requirements for service
of process in the country where a party is incorporated, or country where a
party's headquarters, officers or  directors are located. Nothing in this
_Section 11.13_ shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 


 

 

 

64  


 

 

This _Section 11.13_ shall not apply to any  dispute under _Article III_ that
is required to be decided by the Settlement Accountant.

 

Section 11.14 _Seller Guarantee_. Seller Guarantor, hereby guarantees the
payment and performance of the  obligations of Seller under this Agreement.
This guaranty shall be a full, unconditional, irrevocable, absolute and
continuing guaranty of payment and performance of the obligations of Seller
under this Agreement. If Seller fails to perform any  payment obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or in part, upon becoming due, Seller Guarantor
shall promptly pay to Purchaser or such other Purchaser Indemnified Party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of such  obligation
due and unpaid by Seller. Seller Guarantor shall pay such amount within five
(5) Business Days of receipt of demand for payment from Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party. Purchaser may enforce Seller Guarantor's
obligations  under this _Section 11.14_ , without first suing Seller or
joining Seller in any suit against Seller Guarantor, or enforcing any rights
and remedies against Seller or otherwise  pursuing or asserting any claims or
rights against Seller or any other Person or entity or any of its or their
property which may also be liable with respect to the matters for which Seller
Guarantor is liable under this _Section 11.14_.

 

Section 11.15 _Purchaser Guarantee_. Purchaser Guarantor, hereby guarantees
the payment and performance of the  obligations of Purchaser under this
Agreement. This guaranty shall be a full, unconditional, irrevocable, absolute
and continuing guaranty of payment and performance of the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement. If Purchaser fails to  perform any payment
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, upon becoming due,
Purchaser Guarantor shall promptly pay to Seller or such other Seller
Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount
of such  obligation due and unpaid by Purchaser. Purchaser Guarantor shall
pay such amount within five (5) Business Days of receipt of demand for payment
from Seller or any other Seller Indemnified Party. Seller may enforce
Purchaser Guarantor's obligations  under this _Section 11.15_ , without first
suing Purchaser or joining Purchaser in any suit against Purchaser Guarantor,
or enforcing any rights and remedies against Purchaser or  otherwise pursuing
or asserting any claims or rights against Purchaser or any other Person or
entity or any of its or their property which may also be liable with respect
to the matters for which Purchaser Guarantor is liable under this _Section
11.15_.

 


 

 

 

65  


 

 

Section 11.16 _Release_. Except for any rights or obligations under or
contemplated by this Agreement,  effective upon the Closing, (a) Seller on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Target Companies),
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller  Releasing Parties"),
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges each
and all of the Target Companies and each of their respective current and
former officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, members, 
advisors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Released
Parties") and (b) Purchaser on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including
the Target  Companies), successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser
Releasing Parties" and, together with the Seller Releasing Parties, the
"Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and
forever discharges Seller and each of its current and former officers,
directors, employees, partners, managers,  members, advisors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Released Parties" and, together with the
Purchaser Released Parties, the "Released Parties"), of and from any and all
actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties,
debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and  covenants (whether express or
implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity which
the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released Parties, now or in
the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or  thing relating
to a Target Company or any actions taken or failed to be taken by any of the
Released Parties in any capacity related to a Target Company occurring or
arising on or prior to the date of this Agreement, but only to the extent
that  such cause, matter or thing does not otherwise constitute Fraud;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing  contained herein will operate to
release any claims for Seller's or Purchaser's rights, as applicable, under
the terms of this Agreement (the "Excluded Claims" ).  For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 11.16_ shall prohibit the right of
the Releasing Parties to sue or make a claim against any of the Released 
Parties if such action is based on an Excluded Claim. The provisions of this
_Section 11.16_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by the
Released Parties  referenced in this _Section 11.16_ and each such Person
shall be a third party beneficiary of this _Section 11.16_ ,  as applicable.

 

Section 11.17 _Privilege; Counsel_. Barbosa Mussnich Aragao Advogados ("BMA")
and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("Skadden") have been engaged by
Seller to represent them in  connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on  the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, BMA and/or Skadden may represent Seller in such dispute even
though the interests of Seller may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the
Target Companies or any of their respective Affiliates and even  though BMA
and/or Skadden may have represented a Target Company in a matter substantially
related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser or a
Target Company and (b) waives any conflict in connection therewith.
Purchaser  (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as to all
communications among any of BMA, Skadden and the Target Companies (including
any of their respective  directors, officers or employees) or Seller that
relate in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to Seller and shall be  controlled by Seller and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, a Target Company or any of their
respective Affiliates. Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) further understands and agrees that the Parties have each 
undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of
confidential or attorney-client privileged information. Notwithstanding those
efforts, Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further
understands and agrees  that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege.
Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)  further
understands and agrees that any disclosure of information that may be
confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice or
otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. Purchaser (on its
behalf and on behalf of  its Affiliates) agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed information
to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute  arises between
Purchaser, a Target Company or any of their respective Affiliates and a third
party other than a Party to this Agreement after the Closing, such Target
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of 
confidential communications by BMA and/or Skadden to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the  Target Companies may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. BMA and Skadden shall
each be a third party beneficiary for purposes of this _Section 11.17_.
