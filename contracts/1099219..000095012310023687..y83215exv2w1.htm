 (f) For purposes of this _Section 2.07_, (i) the term "preparer" shall mean the party that prepares any Actual Financial Deliverables, Estimated Financial Deliverables or 

      ##### 

  

    

Quarterly Statutory Statements and calculates the Actual Amounts, the
Estimated Total Adjusted Capital, Estimated Company Risk-Based Capital or the
Quarterly Amounts, as the case may be (it being understood that the term
"preparer" shall be deemed to mean each of the Parent and the Seller, if the
Seller is the preparer), and (ii) the term "recipient" shall mean the party
that does not prepare any Actual Financial Deliverable, Estimated Financial
Deliverable or Quarterly Statutory Statement or calculate any Actual Amount,
Estimated Amount or Quarterly Amount, as the case may be. Without limiting
the generality of _Section 6.04_ and subject to _Section 6.05_ , in
connection with the preparers preparation of any Post-Closing Financial
Deliverable and the preparers calculation of the Actual Amounts or Quarterly
Amounts, to the extent the preparer does not have all reasonable necessary
information in its possession, the recipient shall (i) permit the preparer to
review the recipients working papers and other supporting data, as well as
all of the books, records and other relevant information, in each case,
relating to the operations and finances of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date,
(ii) make reasonably available the individuals in its employ responsible for
and knowledgeable about the information necessary for the preparation of
any Post-Closing Financial Deliverable and the calculation of the Actual
Amounts or Quarterly Amounts, as the case may be, in order to respond to the
reasonable inquiries of the preparer and (iii) otherwise cooperate in good
faith with the preparer. 

   

 (g) During the 30 days immediately following the later of (x) the recipients receipt of the Actual Financial Deliverables and (y) if required, the date on which an Auditors Letter is executed by the recipient and the preparers independent accountants pursuant to _Section 2.07(m)_ (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period_ "), the preparer shall (i) permit the recipient and its Representatives to review the preparers working papers and other supporting data, as well as all of the books, records and other relevant information, in each case, relating to the operations and finances of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date, (ii) make reasonably available the individuals in its employ responsible for, and knowledgeable about the information used in, the preparation of any Actual Financial Deliverable and the calculation of any Actual Amount, as the case may be, in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of the recipient and (iii) otherwise cooperate in good faith with the recipient and its Representatives. 

   

 (h) The preparer shall, through the date that the Final Actual Financial Deliverables become such in accordance with _Section 2.07(k)_, take all actions necessary or desirable to maintain and preserve all accounting books, records, policies and procedures on which the Actual Financial Deliverables were based or on which the Final Actual Financial Deliverables are to be based so as not to impede or delay the calculation of the Actual Amounts or the preparation of the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement or any Final Actual Financial Deliverable in the manner and utilizing the methods permitted by this Agreement. 

   

 (i) The recipient shall notify the preparer in writing (the " _Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period if the recipient disagrees with any of the Actual Financial Deliverables, or the calculation of any Actual Amount, as the case may be. The Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the recipients determination of such Actual Financial Deliverables or Actual Amount, as the case may be. If no Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement is 

      ##### 

  

    

received by the preparer on or prior to the expiration date of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Review Period, then the Actual Financial Deliverables and
the calculation of the Actual Amounts, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the recipient and shall become final and binding upon
the Seller and the Acquiror in accordance with _Section 2.07(k)_. 

   

 (j) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period_ "), the Seller and the Acquiror shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement. 

   

 (k) If, at the end of the Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period, the Seller and the Acquiror have been unable to resolve all disagreements that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement, then the Seller and the Acquiror shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement, including information that relates to items which may not be in dispute but are relevant to the disputed matters (along with a copy of the applicable Actual Financial Deliverables marked to indicate those line items that are in dispute) to KPMG LLP (the " _Expert Accountant_ "). In the event that KPMG LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Expert Accountant, the Seller and the Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith to appoint, within 30 days after the Seller and the Acquiror receive notice from KPMG LLP of its refusal or inability to act as the Expert Accountant, an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the Seller and the Acquiror, in which event "Expert Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within 30 days after the submission of such matters to the Expert Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Expert Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination on the basis of the Agreed Calculating Procedures, the Risk-Based Capital Calculation Methodology, the Parent Accounting Policies, GAAP or SAP, as applicable, and in each case in accordance with this _Section 2.07(k)_ , of the appropriate amount of each of the line items or Actual Amounts in the Actual Financial Deliverables as to which the Seller and the Acquiror disagree as specified in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement. The determination by the Expert Accountant shall be binding on the Acquiror and the Seller, and otherwise shall be final, non-appealable and conclusive. With respect to each disputed line item or Actual Amount, as the case may be, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either the Seller or the Acquiror, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the recipient in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement or the preparer of the applicable Actual Financial Deliverables with respect to such disputed line item or Actual Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the Expert Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement that remain in dispute, unless the Expert Accountants review of such other line items is relevant to the disputed matters or such review or determination is reasonably necessary in order to resolve any disputes that arise from line items or matters that were not initially set forth in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement but that subsequently arose as a result of the Expert Accountants review and determination of those matters in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement that remain in dispute (in which case, such additional line items and matters shall be deemed to have been included in the Notice of Purchase Price Adjustment Disagreement). 

      ##### 

  

    

The Actual Financial Deliverables, the Actual Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Actual Amounts that are final and binding on the Seller
and the Acquiror, as determined either through agreement of the Seller and
the Acquiror (deemed or otherwise) pursuant to _Section 2.07(i)_ or through
the determination of the Expert Accountant pursuant to this _Section 2.07(k)_

dispute procedures and dispute resolution procedures may occur at
separate times with respect to the Actual Financial Deliverables. The 30-day
period for delivering the written award may be extended by the mutual written
consent of the Seller and the Acquiror or by the Expert Accountant for up to
an additional 30 days for good cause shown. Notwithstanding anything else
contained herein, neither the Seller nor the Acquiror may assert that any
award issued by the Expert Accountant is unenforceable because it has not
been timely rendered. 

   

 (l) The cost of the Expert Accountants review and determination shall be shared equally by the Seller and the Acquiror. During the review by the Expert Accountant, the Acquiror, the Parent and the Seller shall each make available to the Expert Accountant such individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Expert Accountant to fulfill its obligations under _Section 2.07(k)_. 

   

 (m) In the event that any party to this Agreement (or the Expert Accountant) requests, pursuant to this _Section 2.07_, access to the work papers and other supporting data of the independent accountants of the other parties to this Agreement relating to the preparation of any Actual Financial Deliverable, Estimated Financial Deliverable or Quarterly Statutory Deliverable and the calculation of the Actual Amounts, the Estimated Total Adjusted Capital, Estimated Company Risk-Based Capital and the Quarterly Amounts, as the case may be, the providing party shall cause its independent accountants to make any such work papers and other supporting data available to the requesting party (including the Expert Accountant) and its independent accountants;  _provided_ , that the requesting party (including the Expert Accountant) has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers and other supporting data in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants (an " _Auditor s Letter_").

 (c) The Acquiror maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that complies with the requirements of the Exchange Act and has been designed by the Acquirors principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As disclosed in the Acquirors Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Acquirors internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008 and the Acquiror has no Knowledge of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. 

   

 (d) The Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries employ disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Acquiror in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Acquirors management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Acquiror has no Knowledge that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to achieve the foregoing objectives.

There are no material weaknesses in the internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Acquiror or any of the Material Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of the Acquiror and any of the Material Subsidiaries in the aggregate to record, process, summarize and report financial data and there is no, and since January 1, 2007, there has not been any instances of, fraud which involves or involved management or other employees who have or had a significant role in the Acquirors internal controls over financial reporting, except any such instances that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2007, neither the Acquiror nor any of the Material Subsidiaries has received, and the Acquiror does not otherwise have Knowledge of, any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, regarding the Acquirors or any of the Material Subsidiaries accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods, including 

      ##### 

  

    

any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Acquiror or
any of the Material Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, other than any such complaints, allegations, assertions
or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

Since January 1, 2007, none of the Acquiror or any of the Material Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority that alleges any noncompliance (or that the Acquiror or any of the Material Subsidiaries is under any investigation by such Governmental Authority for any such alleged noncompliance) with any Governmental Order, material Permit or material Law applicable to the Acquiror or any of the Material Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, assets or businesses, except for any such noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

The Acquiror has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares and the DelAm Shares, and the Acquiror is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss of its investment in the Shares and the DelAm Shares. The Acquiror understands and agrees that it may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares or the DelAm Shares other than pursuant to a registered offering in compliance with, or in a transaction exempt from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state and foreign securities Law.

In the event that such protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, the 

      ##### 

  

    

disclosing party shall furnish only that portion of such Other Partys
Confidential Information that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed information. Each of
the Acquiror, the Parent and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, protect such Other Partys Confidential Information
by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree
of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such Other Partys
Confidential Information as the Acquiror, the Parent or the Seller, as the
case may be, used to protect its own confidential information prior to the
date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any
information about the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries after
the Closing. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and
Representatives having access to such information of such obligation of
confidentiality. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto may
disclose information about the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any facts or materials
relating thereto or reasonably necessary to understand such treatment or
structure). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Parent, the Seller and their respective Representatives may, without notifying the Acquiror or any other Person, share any information relating to or obtained from any of the Acquiror or its Affiliates with (i) subject to the terms and conditions of the Nondisclosure Agreement, dated September 25, 2008, between the FRBNY and the Parent (the " _FRBNY NDA_ ") as in effect on the date hereof, the FRBNY and its Representatives, (ii) the U.S. Treasury and its Representatives and (iii) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and its Representatives (the Persons identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Government Recipients_ "), in each case as the Parent and the Seller deem may be reasonably necessary or advisable in its good faith judgment; _provided_ that the Parent and the Seller shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, request confidential treatment of any of the information included therein and shall exercise their reasonable best efforts to enforce the FRBNY NDA with respect to any such information that the Parent and the Seller may disclose to the FRBNY; _provided_ , _further_ , that this provision shall not apply to any information regarding Taxes, or any matters relating to Taxes, other than with respect to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller shall promptly notify the Acquiror in the event the Parent and the Seller learn that any Government Recipient has been requested or required to disclose any such information or has taken any action that, if taken by the Parent or the Seller, would be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.05_. 

   

 Section 6.06. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable any Governmental Approvals that are necessary, proper or advisable (whether so necessary, proper or advisable prior to, at or after the Closing) under the Transaction Agreements and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Each of the Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in seeking to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all such Governmental Approvals. Neither the Acquiror, the Seller nor the Parent shall take or cause to be taken any action that would 

    ##### 

  

    

reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying, impairing
or impeding the receipt of any such required Governmental Approval. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.06(a)_, the Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent shall each as promptly as reasonably practicable make all filings and notifications with all Governmental Authorities that are necessary, proper or advisable (whether so necessary, proper or advisable prior to, at or after the Closing) under the Transaction Agreements and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including (i) filing change of control applications or disclaimers of control, as appropriate, with applicable regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction where required by applicable Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) filing market share notifications in each jurisdiction where required by applicable insurance Law, (iii) making any appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (iv) making any appropriate filing with the European Commission of a notification in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004, the E.C. Merger Regulations (" _ECMR_ ") and (v) making any other filing that is necessary, proper or advisable (whether so necessary, proper or advisable prior to, at or after the Closing) under any other antitrust, competition, privacy, data protection, insurance or other regulatory Law or by any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust, competition, privacy, data protection, insurance or other regulatory Laws.

      ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries to the extent such agreement is required by any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by

Agreements; and (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take,
in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued
or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued in any proceeding
or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions

enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof,
the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii)

threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , in no
event shall the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates be required under this
_Section 6.06_ to commence, threaten or otherwise seek to commence any
claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding against any Governmental
Authority listed on _Section 6.06(c)_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent, the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under this
_Section 6.06(c)_ pursuant to, or otherwise agree to or accept, any condition
or restriction (A) that would not customarily be imposed in transactions of
the type contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (B) that is not
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Transaction
Agreements, (C) that requires the taking of any action, including an
amendment of any Transaction Agreement or the sale, lease, license, disposal
or holding separate by the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
of any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or
business or other operations or interests therein that would materially
adversely affect the economic benefits reasonably expected to be derived by
the Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent, under the Transaction Agreements or
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereunder;  _provided_ that, in the event that a Governmental Authority
requires that the terms of the Transaction Agreements be changed or altered
in a manner that adversely affects any such benefits reasonably expected to
be derived thereunder, each of the Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts and cooperate and negotiate in good
faith to agree to alternative terms to the Transaction Agreements that are
acceptable to such Governmental Authority and provide benefits substantially
similar to the benefits provided under the original terms thereof, (D)
that materially adversely affect the ability of the Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), taken
as a whole, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, to
conduct its business in the same manner as such business is being conducted,
including by requiring the sale, lease, license, disposal or holding separate
of any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or
business or other operations or interests therein, if such sale, lease,
license, disposal or holding separate would materially adversely affect such
ability to conduct such business in the manner as such business is currently
being conducted or (E) that would otherwise have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect or a 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable (the conditions or
restrictions described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) above, the "
_Negative Conditions or Restrictions_ "). 

   

 (d) Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of the Seller and the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify each other of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority, (ii) permit the other parties to review, in advance to the extent practicable, any material proposed communication by such party or any of its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority, (iii) consult with the other parties in connection with any such proposed communication to the extent practicable and (iv) provide each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between such party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of the staff of any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case to the extent relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and except, in each case, to the extent the communication is between the Seller, the Parent or their Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and the Government Recipients, on the other hand, for purposes other than seeking a determination of non-control under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. None of the Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent, the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or otherwise practicable, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreements and to this _Section 6.06(d)_ , the Seller, the Parent and the Acquiror shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent, the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives (i) to disclose any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent, the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (as the case may be) would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or privacy or (ii) to disclose any privileged information or confidential competitive information of the Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent, the Company, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (as the case may be); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties obligations to notify the other parties with respect to communications received from a Tax Authority, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to any matter related to Taxes, shall be governed solely by _Article VIII_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that none of the parties hereto shall be required to comply with any provision of this _Section 6.06(d)_ to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any materials or information may be withheld or redacted to the extent that they are protected by professional privilege rules (including attorney-client privilege) or as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law. 

   

 (e) The Acquiror, the Seller and the Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to timely obtain any approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver, order, 

      ##### 

  

    

qualification or authorization with respect to (i) any Contracts to which any
of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries is a party and as to which
such approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver, order,
qualification or authorization is necessary or advisable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements as a result of
such Contracts containing a "change in control" or other similar provision or
(ii) any Contracts between the Seller, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) and
a third party, required for the provision, under the Transition Services
Agreement, of Scheduled Services, access to Scheduled Facilities, Additional
Services or access to Additional Facilities (each, a " _Third Party Consent_
"), in each case, with the other partys participation and cooperation. The
Seller and the Parent, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other
hand, shall pay the costs of all Third Party Consents and any "kill fees" or
other penalties (including penalties for unused minimum volume commitments)
in connection with procuring any such Third Party Consent in equal
proportions. In the event that the Seller or the Parent cannot obtain any
Third Party Consent prior to Closing, the Seller, the Parent and the Acquiror
(A) shall, with respect to Contracts contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii)
above to which the Seller, the Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) is a party, use
their reasonable best efforts to provide or cause to be provided to the other
party or parties or its or their Affiliates, as the case may be, the
benefits, and the costs and expenses, of any such Contract, for not longer
than the remainder of the term of such Contract, to the extent permitted
thereunder and (B) shall use reasonable best efforts to secure, and with
respect to those Contracts that are listed on _Section 6.06(e)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter for which a Third Party consent is required to
provide Scheduled Services, access to Scheduled Facilities, Additional
Services or access to Additional Facilities under the Transition Services
Agreement or to prevent termination of such Contract by a third party (the "
_Designated Contracts_ "), shall secure, an alternative arrangement designed
to reasonably provide, where necessary, the operational equivalents of the
Intellectual Property, products, services or benefits provided pursuant to
such Contract, for not longer than the remainder of the term of such
Contract, for which the Third Party Consent was not obtained, _provided_
, that, the present value of the costs and expenses of such provision of
benefits or alternative arrangement (other than attorneys fees or fees for
consultants advising on such alternative arrangement) in excess of the costs
and expenses that would have been incurred pursuant to such Contract had such
Third Party Consent been obtained at no cost, shall be borne by the Acquiror,
on the one hand, and the Parent and the Seller, on the other hand, in equal
proportion;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the alternative arrangement
provides for the Contract to be provided for a longer period of time than
would have been provided for if the Third Party Consent had been obtained,
the Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the costs not
reasonably attributable to the term of service under the original Contract
had the Third Party Consent been obtained. In no event shall the Seller and
the Parent be required to commence, or threaten or otherwise seek to
commence, any claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding to obtain any
Third Party Consent. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the terms "approval,"
"consent," "license," "sublicense," "permit," " waiver," "order,"
"qualification" or "authorization" when used in this  _Section 6.06(e)_
shall in no way be construed to mean an "approval," "consent,"
"license," "sublicense," "permit," "waiver," "order," "qualification" or
"authorization" from a Governmental Authority except to the extent such
Governmental Authority is a counterparty to any third party Contract with the
Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent or any of their respective Affiliates and
(2) the provision of benefits or alternative arrangements may include
assignment of a Contract or portion of a Contract if such 

      ##### 

  

    

Contract or portion of such Contract is solely related to the Business and
such assignment would not prevent the Acquiror, the Seller, the Parent or
their respective Affiliates from performing their obligations under any
Transaction Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.07. _Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by the Parents, the Sellers or their respective Affiliates (other than the Companys and the Transferred Subsidiaries) (as the case may be) blanket insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs in place to the extent such insurance policies or programs cover the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. In connection with the termination of such insurance coverage, at or prior to the Closing, the Parent or the Seller will be permitted, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to pay the amounts set forth on _Section 6.07(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the Seller or the Affiliates as directed by the Parent or the Seller. From and after the Closing Date, if the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries reports a claim solely arising out of its operations covered by the Parents, the Sellers or their respective Affiliates insurance policies, the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Acquiror will fully satisfy the deductible or retention applicable to such claim. 

   

 (b) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies of the Parent, the Seller or their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) and any third party workers compensation insurance policies or comparable workers compensation self-insurance programs sponsored by the Parent, the Seller or their respective Affiliates and that apply to the locations at which the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries operate their respective businesses, the Acquiror may, and may cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to make claims under such policies and programs; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that by making any such claims, the Acquiror agrees to reimburse the Parent and the Seller, in cash, for any increased costs incurred by the Parent, the Seller or their respective Affiliates as a result of such claims, including any retroactive or prospective premium adjustments associated with such coverage, as such amounts are determined in accordance with those policies and programs generally applicable from time to time to the Parent, the Seller or their respective Affiliates; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall make any such claims if, and to the extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies issued or sponsored by the Acquiror or its Affiliates. As of the third anniversary of the date hereof, the Acquiror shall no longer be permitted to report claims with respect to such occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies of the Parent, the Seller or their respective Affiliates or to any such workers compensation insurance policies or comparable workers compensation self-insurance programs that apply to the locations at which the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries operate their respective businesses, and the Acquiror shall assume full responsibility for, and release the Seller and its Affiliates from, all liability for such claims, known or unknown, resulting from occurrences prior to the Closing Date, other than any Losses with respect to which any Acquiror Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery under any Transaction Agreement. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.07_ shall apply to any debts, liabilities, commitments or obligations of any kind relating to or arising out of any Company EandO Claims, which shall be governed by _Section 6.15_. 

   

 Section 6.08. _Intercompany Obligations and Arrangements_.

        ##### 

  

      

 (ii) No later than 60 days following the date hereof, the Seller shall deliver to the Acquiror a true, correct and complete list of all Contracts between the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other hand, in effect as of the date hereof that are not Intercompany Agreements but that the Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates intends to maintain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms (the " _Continuing Contracts_ "). The Parent and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, terminate or commute or cause to be terminated or commuted, on an arms-length basis, without penalty for early termination or commutation, concurrently with the Closing Date, any Contracts between the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other hand, in effect as of the date hereof that are not Intercompany Agreements and that are not identified on the list to be delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.08(b)(ii)_.

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.08(b)_ shall not apply to (A) any Contract between a third party, on the one hand, and the Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, to which the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries is not a party, but under which the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries may otherwise derive benefits, such as enterprise-wide licenses or "master" agreements or (B) any Contract among (x) a third party, (y) the Parent or any of its Affiliates and (z) the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries.

 (b) With respect to each Seller Guaranty for which the parties hereto do not obtain the termination of such Seller Guaranty and a full release of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) from any and all obligations arising under such Seller Guaranty, the Acquiror shall, concurrently with the Closing, enter into a Hold Harmless Agreement with respect to such Seller Guaranty.

 (h) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this _Section 6.11_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for these covenants, the parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge that this _Section 6.11_ constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (i) The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies of the various States of the United States and of the jurisdictions composing the International Jurisdictions may differ as to the validity and enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this _Section 6.11_. It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this _Section 6.11_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of any provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall not render unenforceable or impair the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 6.11_. Accordingly, if at the time of enforcement of any provision of this _Section 6.11_, a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or geographical area and that such court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and geographical area permitted by Law. 

  

 (j) The Parent and the Seller expressly acknowledge that the restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section 6.11_, including the geographic scope and duration of such covenants, are necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary interests and other legitimate business interests of the Acquiror and its Affiliates, and that any violation thereof could result in irreparable injury to the Acquiror and its Affiliates that would not be readily ascertainable or compensable in terms of money, and therefore the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction temporary, preliminary and 

   ##### 

  

 

permanent injunctive relief as well as damages, which rights shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which it may be
entitled.

If (i) the Company or the Prospective Joint Venture fails to obtain any necessary Permit such that the Prospective Joint Venture and the Designated Branch are both prohibited from writing the lines of business written as of the Designated Date by the Designated Branch in the Designated Jurisdiction prior to the Closing, but the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch may administer and collect premiums with respect to the Designated Branchs existing in-force block of business in the Designated Jurisdiction at the Closing, then, at the Closing the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount indicated as "NB" on the Schedule of Designated Amounts, as provided for in  _Section 2.03_, (ii) the Company or the Prospective Joint Venture fails to obtain any necessary Permit such that the Prospective Joint Venture and the Designated Branch are both prohibited from administering and collecting premiums with respect to the Designated Branchs existing in-force block of business in the Designated Jurisdiction at the Closing, but the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch may write the lines of business written as of the Designated Date by the Designated Branch in the Designated Jurisdiction prior to the Closing, then, at the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount indicated as "EB" on the Schedule of Designated Amounts, as provided for in _Section 2.03_, or (iii) the Company or the Prospective Joint Venture fails to obtain any necessary Permits such that the Prospective Joint Venture and the Designated Branch are both prohibited from writing the lines of business written as of the Designated Date by the Designated Branch in the Designated Jurisdiction prior to the Closing and the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch loses the right to administer and collect premiums with respect to the Designated Branchs existing in-force block of business in the Designated Jurisdiction at the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount indicated as "NB/EB" on the Schedule of Designated Amounts, as provided for in _Section 2.03(d)_ or (iv) (A) the Company or the Prospective Joint Venture fails to obtain any necessary Permits such that the Prospective Joint Venture and the Designated Branch are both prohibited from writing the lines of business written as of the Designated Date by the Designated Branch in the Designated Jurisdiction prior to the Closing, and the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch loses the right to administer and collect premiums with respect to the Designated Branchs existing in-force block of business in the Designated Jurisdiction prior to the Closing and (B) the title and ownership of the Companys pro rata share of the assets to the extent of capital and surplus of, or the Capital Stock, directly or indirectly, held by the Company in, the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch, free and clear of all Liens (other than, with respect to such assets, but not 

   ##### 

  

 

Capital Stock, Permitted Liens) is prohibited from being transferred along

at the Closing in relation to the purchase of the Shares by Acquiror, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount indicated as "Grand Total" on
the Schedule of Designated Amounts, as provided for in _Section 2.03_; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, following the Closing, the Acquiror shall, and
shall cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1)
consummate the formation of the Prospective Joint Venture if not so formed
prior to the Closing, (2) obtain any necessary Permits such that the
Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch may write the lines of
business written as of the Designated Date by the Designated Branch in the
Designated Jurisdiction and the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated
Branch may administer and collect premiums with respect to the Designated
Branchs existing in-force block of business in the Designated Jurisdiction
and (3) obtain any necessary Permits such that the Acquiror may take title
and ownership of its pro rata share of the assets to the extent of capital
and surplus of, and the Capital Stock held, directly or indirectly, by the
Company in, the Prospective Joint Venture or the Designated Branch, as the
case may be, free and clear of all Liens (other than, with respect to such
assets, but not Capital Stock, Permitted Liens). In the event that the
Company consummates the formation of the Prospective Joint Venture and
obtains any necessary Permits such that the prohibitions described in clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above are no longer imposed on the Prospective Joint
Venture, the Designated Branch, the Company, any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or the Acquiror, as applicable, within six months following the
Closing then the Acquiror shall pay to the Seller in cash the amount withheld
from the Seller as set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above at
such time, as applicable. In the event that the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries receive any amount with respect to the Designated Branch or the
Prospective Joint Venture from any Person other than the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, within six months following the Closing, pursuant
to the sale or other disposition of all or a portion of the Capital Stock or,
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, assets of the Designated
Branch or the Prospective Joint Venture then, if such sale or other
disposition occurs prior to the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the net proceeds received
by the Company from such sale or other disposition exceeds the amount set
forth on the Schedule of Designated Amounts by which the Purchase Price would
have been reduced had such sale or other disposition not occurred, or, if
such sale or other disposition occurs following the Closing, the Acquiror
shall promptly pay to the Seller the amount of the net proceeds received by
the Company from such sale or disposition up to the amount set forth on the
Schedule of Designated Amounts by which the Purchase Price was reduced at the
Closing. 

   

 (b) The Parent and the Seller shall cause the Company to terminate, effective at or prior to the Closing, the Revised and Restated Reinsurance Agreement, effective as of December 1, 2003, by and between the Company, acting through its branch in Tokyo, Japan, and RGA Reinsurance Co., as the same may have been amended or supplemented from time to time, in accordance with its terms.

been completed or not, such disputes shall be subject to resolution in
the manner contemplated by Section 7.09(a)(i) of the Transition Services
Agreement on an expedited basis as if such provisions were already in effect.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that as the
result of the failure to complete a Required Pre-Close Separation Action by
the Closing Date, the Acquiror, at any time prior to or following the
Closing Date, identifies a service or access to a facility that would be an
Additional Service or an Additional Facility pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, the Acquiror may initiate the process for requesting such
service or access to such facility as would be an Additional Service or an
Additional Facility pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, as if
Section 2.03(a) of the Transition Services Agreement and the portions of the
Transition Services Agreement related thereto were already in effect,
including the provisions related to the rapid and timely escalation
and resolution of any dispute in the manner contemplated by Section
7.09(a)(i) of the Transition Services Agreement on an expedited basis,
_provided,_ that the Seller and the Parent shall bear all incremental costs

therefrom in order to enable delivery to the Company, the cost of such
extraction shall be borne equally by Parent and Acquiror. The Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent, the
Seller, and their respective Affiliates from and against any Losses arising

On not less than 90 days (or such mutually agreeable shorter period) written notice from the Acquiror, the Parent and the Seller shall, at or following the Closing, cause AMG to cause the Investment Management Agreements to be novated or assigned to the Acquirors designee (provided such novation or assignment shall relieve AMG of any future obligations under the assigned agreement except with regard to liabilities which arose prior to the date of the novation or assignment and shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to AMG). The Parent and the Seller shall, and shall cause AMG to, reasonably cooperate with the Acquiror in making any filings or applications with a Governmental Authority to obtain necessary approvals in connection with such novation or assignment. 

  

 (b) The Parent, the Seller and the Acquiror recognize that AMG desires to transition, and the Acquiror desires to assume, full investment management responsibilities for the Investment Assets. The Parent, the Seller and the Acquiror will regularly meet to develop a mutually agreeable investment management transition plan and timetable, and devote sufficient resources to develop such a plan. 

  

 (c) After the Closing, (i) at the Parents request and upon the consent of the Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Acquiror shall, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and subject to the receipt or completion of regulatory approvals and consultations that the Acquiror may reasonably deem appropriate or necessary, assign full discretionary management rights to the assets of the Protected Recovery Fund formed by ALICO U.K. Branch (the " _PRF_ ") to a third party reasonably acceptable to the Acquiror and (ii) from and after July 1, 2012, the Parent may purchase assets from the PRF at market value to the extent such assets have not matured prior to July 1, 2012, as such market value is reasonably determined using the average of at least two (and if commercially reasonably practicable, three)

unaffiliated with any party hereto and who engage as a regular and
significant part of their business in making two way markets in the relevant
products. 

   

 (d) Neither the Parent, the Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates that are parties to any Contract pursuant to which it is obligated to provide any investment management services (or services ancillary thereto) to or on behalf of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary with respect to the PRF before July 1, 2012, shall fail to perform such obligations in accordance with such Contract or amend, terminate, renew or extend such Contract, except with the prior written consent of the Acquiror, prior to the Closing, or the Company, following the Closing.

 (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, each of the Parent and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of any condition to the Closing or that indicates that any of the representations and warranties contained in the Transaction Agreements will not be, or are not, true and correct and (ii) the receipt of any material notice or other communication from any third Person alleging that the approval, consent, authorization, permission or act of, or the making by the Parent, the Seller, the Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any notices to or declaration, filing or registration with, such third Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that such transactions otherwise may violate the rights of or confer remedies upon such third Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or any failure of a condition to the Closing, or to otherwise limit or affect in any way the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.23(a)_ shall not result in a failure of any condition set forth in _Article IX_ or liability to any party hereto under _Article IX_ unless the underlying event or breach would independently result in the failure of such condition or such liability. 

  

 (b) Each of the Parent and the Seller, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of any Action that shall be instituted or threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other of any Action that may be threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Parent, the Seller, the Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, that would have been listed on  _Section 3.08_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or _Section 5.08_ of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, if such Action had arisen prior to the date hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or to satisfy any condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this  _Section 6.23(b)_ shall not result in a failure of any condition set forth in  _Article IX_.

 (ii) not (1) (A) engage in any business or activity or (B) otherwise directly or indirectly acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) any assets, securities, properties, interests or businesses, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, or create, incur, assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise become liable or responsible for (whether directly, contingently or otherwise) any indebtedness or guarantees thereof or any other obligations, in each case, other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as necessary to satisfy or perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party or (2) enter into any Contract with any member, principal or Affiliate, as the case may be, except for, subject to  _Section 6.01_, any Contract that is on arms-length terms and does not adversely affect the Sellers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) maintain adequate capital for the normal obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and character. 

  

 (b) The Parent agrees (i) that it shall cause the Seller to comply with the covenants set forth in _Section 6.24(a)_ and (ii) if the Seller does not have cash or other liquid assets in such amounts and in such form as is necessary to enable it to meet its obligations on a timely basis, including its obligations to indemnify any of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties under the Transaction Agreements, the Parent shall promptly provide to the Seller cash or other liquid assets in such amounts and in such form as is necessary to enable the Seller to meet such obligations in a timely manner or to pay such obligations on a timely basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants contained in this _Section 6.24(b)_ are for the benefit of the Acquiror and its Affiliates, and nothing contained herein shall confer any right, claim or benefit upon any third party, including the Seller.

If any such changes, taken as a whole, to the Equity Units Documents are made that reduce the Fair Value as determined by the Valuation Agent of the Equity Units to the Seller as of the Closing Date, as compared with the Fair Value as determined by the Valuation Agent of the Equity Units, assuming the Equity Units were issued as of the Closing Date without giving effect to any such changes, then the Acquiror shall increase the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the reduction in such Fair Value. Notwithstanding the provisions in  _Section 11.05(e)(i)_ with respect to the payment of the fees and expenses of the Valuation Agent, all fees and expenses incurred by the Valuation Agent in performance of any valuation pursuant to this _Section 6.25_ shall be paid by the Acquiror.

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section 7.01(e)_ and _Section 7.01(l)_ , as of the Closing Date, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall terminate their participation in each Benefit Plan that is not a Company Benefit Plan, and in no event shall any Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under such Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or compensation paid on or after the Closing Date. The Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall retain all rights and obligations under each Company Benefit Plan on and after the Closing Date. The Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary so that (i) as of the Closing Date, only Employees (including their dependents, spouses, or beneficiaries) are participants in (or otherwise have any rights with respect to) the Company Benefit Plans and (ii) except for the obligations and liabilities assumed by Acquiror pursuant to  _Section 7.01(e)_ and _Section 7.01(l)_, neither the Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates shall have or assume any assets related to, obligations under or liabilities with respect to (and the Acquiror and its Affiliates shall be indemnified and held harmless with respect to) any Benefit Plan other than a Company Benefit Plan. 

  

 (b) On or prior to the Closing Date, subject to the exceptions set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) the employment of each employee of the Parent or any of its Affiliates whose duties relate primarily or exclusively to the Business and who at such time is not already employed by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary (other than an employee who is on (A) long-term disability or other unpaid medical leave or (B) leave due to a workplace injury covered by a workers compensation policy or program incurred more than six months prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent the failure to transfer any such employee violates applicable Law, as determined by the Parent in good faith and in consultation with the Acquiror, such employee shall be transferred to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary in accordance with this _Section 7.01(b))_ and (ii) the employment of each employee of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary whose duties do not relate primarily to the Business shall be transferred to the Parent or an Affiliate (other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries). The Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use its best efforts, including obtaining any necessary consents, to effect the transfers contemplated by this  _Section 7.01(b)_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) (i) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Contract, for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Foreign Employee with a base salary rate or base wage rate, incentive compensation opportunities and benefits consistent with the terms and conditions of each Foreign Employees employment agreement or contract and applicable Law or which are otherwise substantially the same in all material respects, as determined by the Acquiror in good faith, as the base salary rate or base wage rate, incentive compensation opportunities and benefits provided to each Foreign Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent permissible under applicable Law and any applicable Contract, the Acquiror shall not take into account, when determining the base salary rate or base wage rate to be provided to any Foreign Employee as described in this _Section 7.01(c)(i)_, the Compensation Restrictions. 

   

 (ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Contract, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, provide each Employee residing in the U.S. (" _U.S. Employees_ ") with (A) a base salary rate or base wage rate not less than such Employees base salary rate or base wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date,  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent permissible under applicable Law and any applicable Contract, the Acquiror shall not take into account, when determining the base salary rate or base wage rate to be provided to any Employee as described in this  _Section 7.01(c)(ii)_, the Compensation Restrictions, and (B) total incentive compensation opportunities that are in the aggregate substantially similar in all material respects to the total incentive compensation opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror or its Affiliates, as the case may be. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the U.S. Employees shall be eligible to participate in each Acquiror Benefit Plan maintained primarily for the benefit of U.S. Employees to the extent that (i) other similarly situated employees of the Acquiror or its Affiliates (other than the Employees) are eligible to participate in such Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) the U.S. Employee is eligible to participate in such Acquiror Benefit Plan under the terms and conditions of such plan, program or arrangement. From and after the Closing, where the applicable severance plan of the Acquiror so provides for participants generally, the U.S. Employees shall have the same rights as other similarly situated employees of the Acquiror or its Affiliates (other than Employees) under, and subject to the terms of, the Acquirors severance plan to receive accelerated vesting of the Employees benefits under any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan upon a termination of employment subject to the terms that qualifies such Employee for severance benefits that include such accelerated vesting. Subject to the foregoing, the terms of any applicable Company Benefit Plan and applicable Law, nothing herein is intended to limit the right of the Acquiror, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries to (A) terminate the employment of any Employee at any time in accordance with the terms and conditions of his or her employment, (B) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for any specific Employee, (C) amend or terminate the terms of any Company Benefit Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or (D) determine the amount of any awards subject to the terms of any Company Benefit Plan or Acquiror Benefit Plan. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) For purposes of determining the eligibility of U.S. Employees to participate on or after the Closing Date under Acquiror Benefit Plans as provided in _Section 7.01(c)_ above (but not for purposes of eligibility to receive retiree life insurance, retiree health or other retiree welfare benefits or subsidized early retirement benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual and vesting), the Acquiror shall give each U.S. Employee full credit for such U.S. Employees service with the Parent, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates to the same extent recognized by the Parent, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date under an analogous plan, except to the extent credit for service during such period is not recognized under the applicable plan, program or arrangement for Acquirors or its Affiliates other employees and except to the extent crediting such service would result in a duplication of benefits. From and after the Closing Date and in accordance with the terms as disclosed in _Section 7.01(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary so that each eligible U.S. Employee shall have access to retiree medical benefits on an employee pay-all unsubsidized basis on the same terms (as they may be amended from time to time, provided that such amendments do not relate solely to the U.S. Employees) applicable to the U.S. employees of the Acquiror who are or will be eligible to receive such benefits, including the service requirements and taking into account each such Employees credited service with the Parent or its Affiliates. 

  

 (e) From and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall assume any and all unpaid obligations for and shall pay (or cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to assume any and all unpaid obligations for and pay) all long-term cash incentive payments under the American International Group, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan as applicable to the Employees (" _LTI Plan_ ") and all annual incentive payments under the program providing for annual incentive payments for the Parent (the " _Annual Incentive Plan_ ") (excluding any such obligations of the Parent described in the last provision of _Section 6.01(z)(xi)_, including those set forth on _Section 6.01(z)(xi)(IV)_, of the Seller Disclosure Letter), whether the obligation therefor arises before, after or as a result of the Closing, payable to any Employee pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan or Annual Incentive Plan as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof, but only to the extent (i) such long-term cash incentive payments or annual incentive payments are payable pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan or Annual Incentive Plan (which shall not include any amounts payable due to the exercise of any discretion by the Parent to increase the amount of such payments above the amount earned based on pre-set objective performance formulas;  _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this exclusion, any decision by the compensation committee of the Parent to accelerate vesting of long-term cash incentive payments or annual incentive payments pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan or Annual Incentive Plan as set forth in this _Section 7.01(e)_ will not be considered to be due to the exercise of any discretion by the Parent to increase the amount of such payments), and (ii) with respect to the portion of the long-term cash incentive payments and annual incentive payments that were, or should have been, reflected in the Final 5/31/10 After-Tax Operating Earnings, only to the extent such portion of the long-term or annual cash incentive payments were so reflected in the Final 5/31/10 After-Tax Operating Earnings. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, from and after the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain any responsibility for such payment obligations, regardless of when such amounts were earned or accrued. With respect to and without limiting the foregoing, if and so long as the Closing takes place during 2010,

(i) Employees will receive a pro rata payout of awards made pursuant to the
Parents LTI Plan for the 2009-2010 performance period in an amount equal to
the product of (A) the amount of such 2009-2010 award based on actual
performance through the Closing Date and (B) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days elapsed in the 2009-2010 performance period from
January 1, 2009 through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in the 2009-2010 performance period and each such pro
rata award will vest on and no earlier than the Closing Date and will be paid
to the Employee by the Acquiror or its Affiliates on or prior to March 15,
2011 (to the extent consistent with applicable Law and section 409A of the
Code), (ii) awards made pursuant to the LTI Plan for the 2010-2011
performance period will be paid by the Acquiror or its Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 7.01(e)_ and otherwise in
accordance with the terms of the LTI Plan in effect as of the date hereof (to
the extent consistent with applicable Law and section 409A of the Code), and
(iii) annual incentive payments for the 2010 performance period will be paid
by the Acquiror or its Affiliates with respect to the entire 2010 performance
period, in a manner substantially consistent with the method used in 2009 for
determining the total amount to be paid under the Annual Incentive Plan and
the relationship of individual targets to individual payments, subject to the
same absolute level of discretion that the Parent had with respect to the
annual incentives in 2009 (to the extent consistent with applicable Law and
section 409A of the Code). With respect to the foregoing, if and so long as
the Closing takes place during 2011, and to the extent unpaid as of the
Closing Date, (i) Employees will receive a payout of the remaining unpaid
portion of the awards made pursuant to the Parents LTI Plan for the
2009-2010 performance period in accordance with the terms of those awards
based on actual performance through 2010, and will be paid to the Employee by
the Acquiror or its Affiliates in accordance with the following schedule: (A)
50% of such awards will vest on and no earlier than January 1, 2011 and be
paid to the Employee on or prior to March 15, 2011, and (B) the remaining 50%

and section 409A of the Code), and (iii) annual incentive payments for the
2010 performance period will be paid by the Company with respect to the
entire 2010 performance period, in a manner substantially consistent with
the method used in 2009 for determining the total amount to be paid under the
Annual Incentive Plan and the relationship of individual targets to
individual payments, subject to the same absolute level of discretion that
the Parent had with respect to the annual incentives in 2009 (to the
extent consistent with applicable Law and section 409A of the Code). In the
event an Employee is terminated by reason of death, long-term disability, or
termination by the employer without "cause" (as defined in _Section 7.01(e)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter) prior to the Closing, the Employee will
receive a pro rata payout of awards made pursuant to the LTI Plan for the
2009-2010 performance period in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
amount of such 2009-2010 award based on actual performance through the end of
the  performance period and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days elapsed in the 2009-2010 performance period from January 1,
2009 through the termination date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the 2009-2010 performance period and each such pro rata
award will be paid at such time as otherwise paid to Employees as set forth
above, _provided_ , _however_ , that if the termination occurs in 2010, the
pro rata award will be 

      ##### 

  

    

paid no later than March 15, 2011. The Parent shall not approve or announce to
participants the LTI Plan performance measures or goals for the 2010-2011 or
any later performance period before giving the Acquiror a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such measures and goals and the Parent
will assent to such comments, except to the extent that such comments are
unreasonable. 

   

 (f) With respect to Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans, the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary) shall have the liability and obligation for all (i) short-term disability, sick pay or salary continuation benefit claims incurred on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) medical, dental, life insurance or other welfare benefit claims incurred on or prior to the Closing Date and (iii) long-term disability claims incurred on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall not assume or otherwise have any liability or obligation with respect to such claims.

For purposes of this _Section 7.01(f)_, a claim or expense shall be deemed to have been incurred as follows: (i) for health, dental and prescription drug claims, upon provision of each such service, (ii) for life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance claims, upon the death or accident giving rise to such claims, (iii) for hospital-provided health, dental, prescription drug claims or the claims which become payable with respect to any hospital confinement, upon commencement of such confinement and (iv) for short-term and long-term disability claims, upon the injury or condition giving rise to such claims, regardless of whether such claims are made and/or identified prior to or after the Closing Date.

 (h) The Company or a Transferred Subsidiary shall, and hereby do, retain, as the case may be, all liability and obligation for severance pay and obligations (together with any statutory related benefits) payable to any Employee with respect to a termination of employment occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that the parties agree that the severance due to any Employee for terminations that are made (or where the determination to terminate such person had occurred) on or prior to May 31, 2010 will be reflected in the Final 5/31/10 After-Tax Operating Earnings. The Acquiror shall, or shall cause to be taken, or its Affiliates shall assume or retain, as the case may be, all liability and obligation for severance pay and obligations (together with any statutory related benefits) payable to any Employee with respect to a termination of employment occurring after the Closing Date. The Acquiror shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, severance benefits determined and payable in accordance with the severance benefit plan(s) set forth in  _Section 7.01(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to Employees who are participants in such plans as of the Closing Date and who, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, have a termination of employment that would qualify such Employee for severance benefits under the terms of the applicable plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, to the extent permissible under applicable Law and any applicable Contract, the Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not take into account, when determining the severance benefits to be provided to any Employee as described in this _Section 7.01(h)_ , the Compensation Restrictions. 

  

 (i) The Seller or its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing workers compensation or similar workers protection benefits with respect to any Employee prior to the Closing Date. The Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing any workers compensation or similar workers protection benefits to any Employee on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary) shall retain the obligation and liability for any workers compensation or similar workers protection claims of any Employee or former employee that arose, or relate to, an incident that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this  _Section 7.01(i)_, a workers compensation or similar workers protection claim shall be deemed to have been incurred upon the injury or condition giving rise to the benefits thereunder. 

  

 (j) (i) As of the Closing Date, the Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, take all necessary actions to ensure that (i) effective immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries cease to be participating employers in the Parents United States Retirement Plan (" _Parent s Pension Plan_") and the Parent Incentive Savings Plan (" _Parent s Savings Plan_"), (ii) as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, contributions (including salary deferrals and matching contributions) are made to the Employees accounts in the Parents Savings Plan with respect to the period of service ending on the Closing Date and without regard to any last-day or minimum hours of service requirements, and (iii) effective as of the Closing Date, the Employees accrued benefits under the Parents Pension Plan and under the Parents Savings Plan are fully vested. No assets or liabilities with respect to the Parents Pension Plan or the Parents Savings Plan shall be transferred to or assumed by the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), any plan sponsored by the Acquiror or its Affiliates, any Company Benefit Plan or any trust related to the foregoing, whether pursuant to section 8.01 of the Parents Pension Plan or otherwise. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Acquiror shall cause each Employee who was a 

   ##### 

  

 

participant in the Parents Savings Plan and who has an account balance under
such Parents Savings Plan to be permitted to elect a "direct rollover," in
the form of cash, a promissory note (in the case of loans) or any combination
thereof, of such Employees account balance from the Parents Savings Plan to
an Acquiror employee benefit plan that is a defined contribution plan within
the meaning of section 3(34) of ERISA (an " _Acquiror Savings Plan_ ") subject
to and  _provided_ that the Acquiror or the proper fiduciaries of the
applicable Acquiror Savings Plan become reasonably satisfied, consistent with
the regulations under section 401(a)(31) of the Code and ERISA, that the
Parents Savings Plan meets the requirements for qualification under section
401(a) of the Code and the requirements of the Acquiror Savings Plan. The
Parent and the Acquiror shall and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate
with each other to provide such information regarding the Employees as may be
necessary for each party to facilitate determinations of eligibility for, and
payments of benefits to, the Employees under their respective
qualified retirement plans. In the case of any Employee with an outstanding
loan balance under the Parents Savings Plan, the Parent or the Seller and
Acquiror shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all necessary action, to
the extent permissible under applicable Law and the terms of the
Acquiror Savings Plan, to permit such Employee to rollover such outstanding
loan balance to the Acquiror Savings Plan through a direct rollover on or as
soon as administratively possible after the Closing Date. 

    

 (ii) The Parent, the Seller and their Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing) from and against any Losses relating, directly or indirectly, to the Parents Pension Plan, including, but not limited to, (A) by reason of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries being an ERISA Affiliate of the Parent or the Seller, (B) the imposition by the PBGC of any contribution obligations, funding enhancements or similar obligations on the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Acquiror and its Affiliates, or (C) by reason of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries having participated in a "multiple employer" plan (within the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or section 413(c) of the Code) with the Parent. The Parent, the Seller and their Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing) from and against any Losses relating, directly or indirectly, to the Parents Savings Plan, including, but not limited to, by reason of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries having participated in a "multiple employer" plan (within the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or section 413(c) of the Code) with the Parent. 

  

 (k) With regard to the Parent Pension Plan in the United Kingdom (" _UK Pension Plan_ " which expression includes, unless the context otherwise requires, the trustees from time to time thereof): 

   

 (i) the Seller shall procure that such of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries which participate in the UK Pension Plan (each the " _UK Employer_ ") shall cease to do so not later than the Closing Date; 

   

 (ii) the Seller shall procure or if it has not done so by the Closing Date the Acquiror shall procure that the UK Employer gives written notice to the trustees of the UK Pension Plan that there is to apply to the UK Employer a relevant transfer 

   ##### 

  

   

deduction (within the meaning of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Employer
Debt) Regulations 2005 (as amended or replaced from time to time) (the "
_Employer Debt Regulations_ "); 

   

 (iii) the Seller and as from the Closing Date the Acquiror shall use their respective reasonable endeavors to procure that enhanced transfer values are offered and (if accepted) provided for those of the employees and former employees of the UK Employer who are members of the UK Pension Plan but whose pensions have not yet come into payment (each a " _Relevant Member_ "). For this purpose an "enhanced transfer value" means, in relation to a Relevant Member, the payment (in lieu of the benefits otherwise payable under the UK Pension Plan to or in respect of the Relevant Member) of a transfer value from the UK Pension Plan for the Relevant Member to an appropriate arrangement selected by the Relevant Member plus if the Seller so determines a cash payment to the Relevant Member; 

   

 (iv) In connection with any enhanced transfer offer the UK Employer shall promptly pay to the UK Pension Plan such amount as the UK Pension Plan requires to finance any enhancement to the amount of the transfer value over that which would otherwise be payable from the UK Pension Plan and shall pay any cash payment to the Relevant Member and any employer National Insurance Contributions payable on any such cash payment (but see  _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_). The terms of the enhanced transfer value offer (including, in particular, the amount of any enhancement to the transfer value and the amount of any cash payment) shall be determined by the Seller; 

   

 (v) Forthwith following the end of the transfer-out period (as defined in the Employer Debt Regulations and is currently so defined as the period between the UK Employer ceasing to employ active members of the UK Pension Plan and the day that is twelve months later) the Seller and the Acquiror shall use their reasonable endeavors to procure that the amount of any debt payable to the UK Pension Plan by the UK Employer pursuant to section 75 or 75A of the UK Pensions Act 1995 (as amended or replaced from time to time) (the " _Section 75 Debt_") is determined promptly in accordance with that section and the amount thereof is promptly notified to the Seller and the Acquiror. 

   

 (vi) Forthwith following the amount of the Section 75 Debt being so notified the Seller (but only if such certification is made prior to the Closing Date) and the Acquiror (as from the Closing Date or the date of such notification if later) shall use their respective reasonable endeavors to procure that the UK Employer promptly discharges the Section 75 Debt. 

   

 (vii) The Seller shall on demand indemnify on an after-tax basis the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the UK Employer) from and against each of the following: 

  

       | (A)  |   | the aggregate amount to be paid by the
UK Employer pursuant to _Section 7.01(k)(iv)_;

    | (C)  |   | any contribution notice or financial support direction
issued by the UK Pensions Regulator pursuant to sections 35-51 of the UK
Pensions Act 2004 (as amended or replaced from time to time) in connection
with the UK Pension Plan and the UK Employers participation therein;  
      
    | (D)  |   | any Loss arising from (I) the UK
Employers participation in the UK Pension Plan, including due to the
benefits payable under the UK Pension Plan not having been equalized between
men and women to the extent such equalization is required on account of
any inequality in the guaranteed minimum pensions and accrued rights thereto
(within the meaning of the UK Pension Schemes Act 1993) or (II) the events
contemplated by _Section 7.01(k)(iii)_ but (and without prejudice to (A),
(B) or (C) in this  _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_) the indemnity contained in
this  _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_(D)(II)does not extend to (X) any contributions
or other amounts payable in the ordinary course to the UK Pension Plan in
respect of any period prior to Closing, or (Y) any Loss arising from any act
or omission of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates after the Closing
Date.  
   

   

 (viii) For the purposes of determining the after-tax basis _Section 11.07(b)_ shall apply as if any amount payable pursuant to the indemnity contained in _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_ was payable pursuant to _Article XI_. 

   

 (ix) In relation to contribution notices and financial support directions, the indemnity contained in _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_ shall extend to any person associated with or connected with the Acquiror or its Affiliates from time to time (and "associated" and "connected" shall have the meaning which they bear in sections 35-51 of the UK Pensions Act 2004). 

   

 (x) As disclosed in _Section 6.01(z)(xi)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Seller agrees with the UK Pension Plan a scheme apportionment arrangement or a withdrawal arrangement (both within the meaning of the Employer Debt Regulations) in connection with the cessation of participation in the UK Pension Plan of the UK Employer: 

  

       | (A)  |   | the Acquiror shall procure that (if such
scheme apportionment arrangement or withdrawal arrangement, as the case
may be, has not been entered into before the Closing Date) the UK
Employer at the behest of the Seller promptly enters into such arrangement;
and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | the amount (if any) payable under that arrangement by
the UK Employer shall for the purposes of the indemnity contained in

       |   |   | _Section 7.01(k)(vii)_ above be deemed to be the
Section 75 Debt.

 (l) (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall, and hereby do, assume the liability and obligation for, and shall indemnify the Parent, the Seller and their Affiliates against any liability or obligation for, all obligations (whether or not vested) which have accrued as of the Closing Date under the American International Group, Inc. Retirement Excess Plan and the American International Group, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the " _Parent Nonqualified Plans_ ") with respect to any Employee or former employee of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries who participates therein, including those in pay status (the " _Nonqualified Accrued Liability_ "). On or prior to the Closing Date, the Parent Nonqualified Plans shall be amended by the Parent or an Affiliate effective prior to the Closing Date to freeze accruals (including freezing eligibility for any early retirement subsidy) as of the Closing Date for every participating Employee or former employee of the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries. Such Nonqualified Accrued Liabilities shall be paid under one or more nonqualified deferred compensation plans maintained or adopted by the Company, the Acquiror, or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, which must preserve and maintain, in accordance with applicable Law, all material terms governing the time, form of payment and amounts accrued as of the Closing Date under the Parent Nonqualified Plans. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.01(l)_ shall require the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to provide deferred compensation benefits that, in the aggregate, exceed the Nonqualified Accrued Liability. Such accrued amounts shall vest no later than the date such amounts would have vested in accordance with the vesting terms of the Parent Nonqualified Plans and for purposes of vesting in such accrued amounts, the Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall take into account any such Employees credited service with the Parent and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date and service with the Acquiror or its Affiliates on and after the Closing Date. The Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide any benefits under such plans for services rendered after the Closing Date. The Parent agrees that it will indemnify the Acquiror or its Affiliates for any Taxes and related expenses that the Employees may incur, which are reimbursed by the Acquiror or its Affiliates, resulting from any failure of the Parent Nonqualified Plans to have been established, documented or operated through the Closing Date in accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (" _409A Penalty_ "), including by reason of the Companys and the Transferred Subsidiaries assumption of the liability thereunder pursuant to this _Section 7.10(l)_; p _rovided_ , _however_ , the Acquiror shall promptly notify the Parent in writing upon receipt by the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary of notice of any current or pending 409A Penalty. 

   

 (ii) Not later than 30 days after the date hereof, the Parent, the Parents actuary, the Acquiror and the Acquirors actuary shall commence to determine the Nonqualified Accrued Liability. If the parties are unable to agree on or prior to the end of the 90 day period after the date hereof on a preliminary amount of the Nonqualified Accrued Liability, the Seller and the Acquiror shall appoint a third actuary from a globally recognized actuarial firm to determine the Nonqualified Accrued Liability (the costs of the third actuary shall be shared equally by the Seller and the Acquiror) to make such determination. The third actuary shall consider only the issues of disagreement between the first two actuaries, it being understood that the third actuary shall not be retained to conduct its own independent review, but rather shall be retained to resolve 

   ##### 

  

   

specific differences between the Sellers actuary and the Acquirors actuary.
The third actuarys determination shall be (A) provided within 45 days after
appointment, (B) limited on a plan by plan basis either to the position of
the Seller or the Acquiror and (C) final and binding on the parties. The
Parent agrees to provide the Acquiror and the Acquirors Actuary with all
necessary information, including information on each applicable Employee, in
order for them to confirm the determination of the Nonqualified
Accrued Liability and administer the Parent Nonqualified Plans. Following the
actuarial methodology used to determine the preliminary amount of the
Nonqualified Accrued Liability in accordance with the process set out in this
_Section 7.01(l)(ii)_, a final determination of the Nonqualified Accrued
Liability will be made by the Parent and the Acquiror within 30 days of the
Closing Date. The Parent shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to the
Acquiror, or an Affiliate of the Acquiror, a cash payment promptly (but not
later than 15 Business Days) after the final amount of the Nonqualified
Accrued Liability is determined. 

  

 (m) Prior to the Parent or the Acquiror, or either of their Affiliates, making any material written statement or other formal announcement prior to the Closing to current or former employees (or individuals who will become Employees as of the Closing Date), independent contractors, consultants or directors of the Company or any of Transferred Subsidiary pertaining to (i) compensation or benefits that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) compensation or benefits that will be provided by the Acquiror or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall provide the Parent, the Company and the applicable Transferred Subsidiary, if any, or the Parent, the Company and the applicable Transferred Subsidiary, if any, shall provide the Acquiror, as the case may be, with a copy of the intended communication. The party that is provided the copy of the communication shall be given a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication and return any comments to the other party within the reasonably requested period of time and, if applicable, in accordance with the notification and/or communication provisions in any applicable Contract or collective bargaining agreement. The parties shall cooperate in providing, or causing to be provided, any such mutually agreeable communication. 

  

 (n) On or before the date of this Agreement, the Parent shall have delivered to the Acquiror the actuarial valuations (together with all underlying assumptions) as described in  _Section 7.01(n)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, prepared as of November 30, 2009, setting forth the value of the assets and liabilities in the Japan pension plans and the Greece pension plans identified as such in _Section 3.13(h)(v)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Japan and Greece Pension Plan Valuations_ "). Not later than 60 Business Days after the Closing Date or such other time as is mutually agreed by the Parent and the Acquiror, the Acquiror and the Acquirors actuary shall have an opportunity to review the Japan and Greece Pension Plan Valuation and, to the extent that the Acquiror and the Acquirors actuary determine that the Parent has used actuarial assumptions that did not comply with the plan terms or that were not reasonable and consistent with actuarial standards of practice in the local country used to meet the requirements of U.S. GAAP accounting, the Seller and the Acquiror shall appoint a third actuary from a globally recognized actuarial firm to review the Japan and Greece Pension Plan Valuation (the costs of the third actuary shall be shared equally by the Seller and the Acquiror). The third actuary shall consider only the issues of disagreement between the first two actuaries, it being understood that the third actuary shall not be retained to conduct its own independent review, but 

   ##### 

  

 

rather shall be retained to resolve specific differences between the Sellers
actuary and the Acquirors actuary. If the third actuary determines that the
Japan and Greece Pension Plan Valuation used actuarial assumptions that did
not comply with the plan terms or that were not reasonable and consistent
with actuarial standards of practice in the local country used to meet the
requirements of U.S. GAAP accounting, the Acquiror shall be entitled to a
payment equal to the difference between the Japan and Greece Pension Plan
Valuation and a valuation of the Japan and Greece pension plans that the
third actuary determines is reasonable and consistent under
actuarial standards of practice in the local country used to meet the
requirements of U.S. GAAP accounting. The third actuarys determination shall
be (i) provided within 45 days after appointment, (ii) limited on a plan by
plan basis either to the position of the Seller or the Acquiror and
(iii) final and binding on the parties. The payment shall be made in cash as
soon as practicable (but not more than ten (10) days) following the actuarys
determination. The Parent and the Acquiror shall bear the costs of the third
actuary equally. 

   

 (o) The Parent and the Acquiror shall, or shall ensure that their Affiliates shall, comply with their respective consultation and other obligations arising out of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in respect to the Employees (including those individuals who will become Employees on or prior to the Closing Date) of the Company, any Transferred Subsidiary, or their respective union or elected representatives, or other employee representative body, as required by Law, collective bargaining agreements or any other applicable regulations and shall cooperate in connection therewith, with such cooperation to include, if applicable, obtaining from all Foreign Employees, directors, independent contractors, agents and brokers of the Company and Transferred Subsidiaries express written consents to the cross border transfer of their personal data to the Acquiror following the signing of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto will use good faith efforts to comply with their obligations under this _Section 7.01(o)_ as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

  

 (p) The provisions of this _Section 7.01_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Employees, including those individuals who will become Employees on or prior to the Closing Date, or former employees of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies, with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 7.01_ under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. This _Section 7.01_ shall not be considered, or deemed to be, an amendment to any Benefit Plan or any compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates. 

  

 (q) The Parent and its Affiliates shall take such action as are necessary to permanently waive, as of the Closing Date, any and all restrictions on competition under any agreement or arrangement enforceable by the Parent or its Affiliates that would in any way adversely affect an Employees ability to provide services after the Closing Date to or on behalf of Acquiror and its Affiliates, including the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, and, on or before the Closing Date, the Parent shall or shall cause its Affiliates to, notify all Employees who are subject to any such restrictions on competition that such restrictions will be permanently waived as of the Closing Date.

(Taxes described in clauses (A) to (E) of this _Section 8.01(a)_ being
hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Excluded Taxes_ "). 

   

 (b) Parent, the Seller or any Retained Affiliate shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes or credit or allowance for Taxes (other than any Excluded Taxes) that, in each case, (i) were imposed on the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) are actually paid by the Seller pursuant to an indemnity claim brought under _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.07_; or (iii) with respect to a Straddle Period, is a credit for a reduction in a liability to pay Tax in respect of the portion of such Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date due solely to a payment of an estimated Tax during the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to a refund, credit or allowance for a liability for Tax related to an amount of Tax for which a claim for indemnity under _Section 8.07(a)(i)(B)_ was made, such refund, credit, or allowance shall be solely for the Acquirors account until the amount of Acquirors portion of the liability for Taxes that relate to the adjustments to Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company that gave rise to such a claim for indemnity is reduced to $200,000,000 after taking into account such refunds, credits, or allowances, and thereafter all remaining refunds, credits, and allowances relating to such liability for Taxes shall be split 50/50 between the Seller and the Acquiror; _provided_ , _further_ , _however,_ that any refund, credit or allowance for Taxes described in this _Section 8.01(b_) shall be for the Acquirors account to the extent such refund, credit or allowance (A) was taken into account on the Reference Balance Sheet or Final Closing Balance Sheet, _provided_ , _however_ , that refunds, credits, or allowances set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be for the Sellers account to the extent such refunds, credits and allowances relate to a liability for Taxes of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary that has been reflected on the profit and loss statement of the relevant taxpayer in a period prior to the Closing Date and for which a specific accrual was set forth on the Final Closing Balance Sheet to offset the value of such refund, credit or allowance to reflect a discount for the value of such refund, credit or allowance due to the risk such refund, credit or allowance may not be obtained, and such refund, credit, or allowance for Tax is set forth on a schedule to be provided by the Seller to the Acquiror no later than 60 days after the date hereof and to the extent consented to by the Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld taking into account the above standards, or (B) relates to a Tax attribute of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary that is attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, all refunds, credits and allowances for Taxes (including items described in the provisos to the immediately preceding sentence that are for the Acquirors account) shall be for the benefit of the Acquiror. Promptly after receipt of a refund, or claiming a credit or allowance by one party or an Affiliate thereof that is for the benefit of the other party or an Affiliate thereof under this _Section 8.01(b)_ , the party receiving such refund, or claiming a credit or allowance shall pay to the other party the amount of any such item. For purposes of this _Section 8.01(b)_, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be considered an Affiliate of the Acquiror. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in _Sections 8.01(a)_ and _Section 8.07_, the Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties, from and against: (i) all Taxes (other than Taxes imposed by a United Kingdom Tax Authority) imposed on the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable Periods and, with respect to any 

      ##### 

  

    

Straddle Period, Taxes (other than Taxes imposed by a United Kingdom Tax
Authority) attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date, (ii) Excluded Taxes, (iii) the amount of Tax payable
by the Seller or its Affiliates to a relevant Tax Authority to the extent
such amount has already been paid by the Seller to the Acquiror pursuant to a
claim for indemnity under this _Article VIII_, or (iv) Losses relating to or
resulting from the breach or nonperformance by the Acquiror of any covenant
set forth in this Agreement that relates to Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Acquiror shall not indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties with
respect to Transfer Taxes to the extent such Transfer Taxes are
the responsibility of the Seller under _Section 8.01(e)_. 

   

 (d) For purposes of this _Article VIII_, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one of which ended at the end of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date. Items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary were closed at the end of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that 

    

 (i) (A) the Taxes resulting from transactions described in clause (C) of _Section 8.01(a)_ shall be allocated to the taxable period that is deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and (B) the Taxes resulting from transactions described in _Section 8.01(a)(ii)_ and _Section 8.01(a)(iv)_ shall be allocated to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date, 

   

 (ii) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., property Taxes) and exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable periods on a "daily basis;"  _provided_ , _however_ , that in allocating any such exemptions, allowances, or deductions (or increase in such amounts) between the two periods that comprise a Straddle Period, any such items that relate to an asset or property that was sold, acquired or improved by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary during the Straddle Period shall be allocated on a daily basis solely among the days in the Straddle Period during which such asset was owned or such improvement existed; and 

   

 (iii) Taxes (other than income Taxes), imposed in whole or in part on the basis of taxable premiums for a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the taxable period that is deemed to end on and includes the Closing Date based upon the amount of taxable premium accrued from the beginning of the relevant taxable period to and through the end of the Closing Date, as adjusted to reflect any premiums included therein but returned by the end of the relevant taxable period that comprises the Straddle Period to the extent no premium tax is imposed on such returned premiums under the Law of the relevant jurisdiction and taking into account any licenses, fees, credits and other attributes (except as set forth in the immediately following sentence) paid, incurred or available for 

   ##### 

  

    

the entire taxable period that constitutes the Straddle Period but allocable
to such taxable premium to the extent such items are available as an offset
or credit against premium taxes under the Law of the relevant jurisdiction,
_provided_ , such licenses, fees, credits and other attributes are not taken
into account as an asset on the Reference Balance Sheet or Final Closing
Balance Sheet. For purposes of this clause (iii), assessment credits and fee
credits, provided against a premium tax liability shall be allocated in
the following manner (x) for the account of the Seller to the extent such
amount was paid prior to the Closing Date and neither the Reference Balance
Sheet nor the Final Closing Balance Sheet takes such assessment credits or
fee credits into account and (y) for the account of the Acquiror in all other
events. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Acquiror and the Seller shall each bear 50% of any Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement. Such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the party (including the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary) legally responsible to pay such Taxes (with the other party paying the party that is legally responsible to pay the Tax such other partys share of such Tax at least three (3) Business Days before the Tax payment due date). Both parties will join (or will cause the relevant taxpayers to join) in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation as required by Law, with any disputes governed by the procedures of _Section 8.03_. Any refund, credit or allowance for Tax resulting from a Transfer Tax subject to this provision shall be shared equally between the Seller and the Acquiror. 

   

 (f) (i) A breach of a representation or warranty with respect to Taxes (including the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.20_) shall be deemed to exist if such representation or warranty would have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not contained any qualification as to material, materiality, or similar language, (ii) the amount of the indemnity provided under _Section 8.01(a)_ in respect of any breach of a representation or warranty, including any deemed breach resulting from the application of clause (i), shall be determined without regard to any qualification as to material, materiality, or similar language, and (iii) any disclosure provided in  _Section 3.20_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter after the date hereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining any indemnification obligation (or the validity or amount of such obligation) under this  _Article VII_I, or whether the conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied. 

   

 (g) The parties agree that to the extent the Acquiror Indemnified Parties can bring a claim for indemnity under _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_ and another clause of _Section 8.01(a)_, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be required to bring such claim for indemnity under  _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to _Sections 8.07(b)(iii) and 8.07(e)_, to the extent a party has received an indemnity payment under a specific provision of this _Section 8.01_, _Section 8.06(e)_, or _Section 8.07_, the indemnified party shall not be entitled to bring another claim under another provision of this _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.06(e)_ to the extent the prior indemnity payment received by the indemnified party was equal to the full amount of Taxes or Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 8.01_, _Section 8.06(e)_, _or Section 8.07_. 

   

 (h) Subject to _Section 8.01(g_), and other than for a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.07_, the Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Acquiror 

      ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party for Taxes, lost Tax benefits and the amounts described in
_Section 8.01(a)(xii)_ resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty in  _Section 3.20_, or Taxes imposed in Post-
Closing Taxable Periods due to a breach of the covenant in _Section
8.02(b)(iii)(z)_ solely as a result of Tax Returns described in  _Section
8.02(b)(iii)(z)_ not being truthful or correct, (collectively, " _Tax Losses_
"), (i) until with respect to such claim (or series of related claims arising
from substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) such
claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Tax Losses in excess of
$87,500 (nor shall any such claim or series of related claims that do not
meet the $87,500 threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Tax Losses for which the Seller has
responsibility under (ii) below); and (ii) until the aggregate amount of all
Tax Losses exceeds $50,000,000, after which the Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and against
all such amounts in excess of $50,000,000, _provided_ , that the amount of
all Taxes, lost Tax benefits and the amounts described in _Section
8.01(a)(xii)_ that are limited by this provision shall not be applied and
counted against the $125,000,000 deductible limitation set forth in
_Section 11.02(b)_ of this Agreement for purposes of determining when the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties have exceeded such limitation with respect to
Capped Losses. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 8.01(h)_ shall not
be interpreted or applied in any manner that would apply the limitations set
forth herein to any Taxes or Losses for a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, including with respect to any
such period for which a Tax Return described in _Section 8.02(b)(iii)(z)_
has been filed, regardless of whether a claim for indemnity for any such
Taxes or Losses is brought under _Section 8.01(a)(ii)_ or _ Section
8.01(a)(vii)_. 

   

 (i) For the avoidance of doubt, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be permitted to bring a claim for Taxes pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)_ (other than a claim permitted under  _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_ or ( _vii)_ resulting from a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant that applies to actions taken prior to the Closing Date) due to a reduction in the value of the Company prior to the Closing Date that results from the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary paying its liability for Taxes in the ordinary course of such Persons business prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that this _Section 8.01(i)_ shall not (1) be applicable to the provisions addressing adjustments to the Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement or (2) prevent the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from bringing a claim against the Seller pursuant to  _Section 8.01(a)_ with respect to any Taxes that a Tax Authority attempts to collect from the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary (even if such Tax has been previously paid).

 (iii) Except as provided in clause (i)(B) above and subject to the provisions of  _Section 8.01(a)_ and _Section 8.02(c)_, with respect to any Tax Return for any Straddle Period, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file such Tax Returns (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) and pay the Taxes due with such Tax Returns within the time and manner prescribed by applicable Law.

 (iii) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary described under _Section 8.02(a)(i)(B)_ (to the extent filed after the Closing Date) and _Section 8.02(a)(ii)_, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to submit to the Seller a draft copy of such Tax Return (or with respect to a combined, consolidated, unitary or other group basis return, a pro forma copy of the Companys or Transferred Subsidiarys portion of such Tax Return) as soon as reasonably practical and no later than the number of Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return set forth below, in each case, unless commercially impractical or not possible. The number of Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns referred to in the preceding sentence shall be (A) forty-five (45) Business Days in the case of the U.S. federal income tax return of the Parent Group that includes the Company for the taxable period of the Company ending on November 30, 2009; (B) thirty (30) Business Days in the case of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Returns filed on a consolidated, unitary or combined basis with the Parent, the Seller or any Retained Affiliate, (C) thirty (30) Business Days in the case of U.S. federal, state or local Tax Returns of the Company not described in sub-clause (B) above for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2010 and for the U.K. corporate income tax return of the Company for any taxable period beginning on or before January 1, 2010, and (D) ten (10) Business Days in all other cases.

Seller and Parent each covenant that all Tax Returns described in
_Section 8.02(a)(ii)_ shall be true and correct in all material respects when
filed. 

   

With respect to Tax Returns described in _Section 8.02(a)(i)(B)_ for Straddle
Periods, no changes shall be made to such Tax Returns without the prior
review and approval by the Acquiror of items or positions taken or reported
on such Tax Returns that could adversely affect the Acquiror, the Company,
any Transferred Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates, which approval may not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may in all cases be withheld if such
Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause (i) of this
_Section 8.02(b)_. The Acquiror shall provide written notice to the Seller no
later than thirty (30) Business Days after having been sent a copy of such
Tax Return of (1) its approval thereof, or (2) if the Acquiror objects to
such Tax Return, the items of dispute and a reasonably detailed explanation
of such dispute. To the extent there is a dispute with respect to such Tax
Returns, the parties will in good-faith attempt to resolve such
dispute; provided, that if such dispute cannot be settled within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of Acquirors notice of dispute, the disputed items shall
be submitted to a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized accounting firm
for settlement which firm shall decide solely which position is more correct
with respect to the disputed items, and the decision from such firm shall be
binding on the parties unless otherwise inconsistent with a Determination
that occurs subsequent to such decision. The costs of such accounting firm
shall be shared equally between the Seller and the Acquiror. If the
Acquirors approval or notice of objection (or settlement or conclusion of a
Acquiror dispute) for a Tax Return subject to this clause (iii) is not
provided within two (2) days prior to the filing date (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) for any such Tax Return, the Parent or the
Seller shall cause such Tax Return to be filed in accordance with the Parent
or Sellers position, provided that upon a Determination, or the resolution
of a disputed item by the accounting firm or otherwise, the Seller shall
cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to amend and re-file such
Tax Returns or otherwise file a request for correcting such Tax Returns to
the extent such Tax Returns are inconsistent with such Determination
or resolution or settlement of the disputed item. The Seller shall cause the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries not to re-file any such amended Tax
Return until first reviewed by the Acquiror, provided, that such Tax Return
shall be filed in accordance with a Determination, or the resolution of the
dispute by the accounting firm or otherwise in all cases. The Seller and
Parent each covenant that all Tax Returns described in
_Section 8.02(a)(i)(B)_ shall be true and correct in all material respects
when filed. 

   

 (iv) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary under _Section 8.02(a)(iii)_, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to submit to the Seller a draft copy of such Tax Return as soon as reasonably practical and no later than ten (10) Business Days (and in the case of the U.S. federal income tax return of the Company for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2010, thirty (30) days if such Tax Return is for a Straddle Period) prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (in each case, unless commercially impractical or not possible) for review and approval by the Seller of items or positions taken or reported on such Tax Return that could adversely affect the Parent or the Seller or any of their Affiliates, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed 

   ##### 

  

    

but may in all cases be withheld if such Tax Returns were not prepared in
accordance with clause (i) of this _Section 8.02(b)_. The Seller shall
provide written notice no later than thirty (30) Business Days after having
been sent a copy of such Tax Return of (A) its approval thereof, or (B) if
the Seller objects to such Tax Return, the items of dispute and a reasonably
detailed explanation of such dispute. To the extent there is a dispute with
respect to such Tax Returns, the parties will in good-faith attempt to resolve
such dispute; provided, that if such dispute cannot be settled within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of Sellers notice of dispute, the disputed items
shall be submitted to a mutually agreeable, nationally recognized accounting
firm for settlement which shall decide solely whether the filing party or
non-filing partys position is more correct with respect to the disputed
items, and the decision from such firm shall be binding on the parties
unless otherwise inconsistent with a Determination that occurs subsequent to
such decision. The costs of such accounting firm shall be shared equally
between the Seller and the Acquiror. If the Sellers approval or notice of
objection (or settlement or conclusion of a Seller dispute) for a Tax Return
subject to this clause (iv) is not provided within five (5) Business Days
prior to the filing date (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) for any such Tax Return, the Acquiror shall file such Tax
Return in accordance with the Acquirors position, provided that upon a
Determination, or the resolution of all disputed items by the accounting firm
or otherwise, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries to amend and re-file such Tax Returns or otherwise file
a request for correcting such Tax Returns to the extent such Tax Returns are
inconsistent with such Determination or resolution or settlement of the
disputed items. The Acquiror shall cause the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries not to re-file any such amended Tax Return until first reviewed
by the Seller, provided, that such Tax Return shall be filed in accordance
with a Determination, or the resolution of the dispute by the accounting firm
or otherwise in all cases. 

   

 (v) With respect to any Tax Return described in _Section 8.02(a)(ii)_ relating to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period that Acquiror is responsible for causing to be filed, the Acquiror shall be responsible for causing such Tax Returns to be timely filed; provided, however, that if the Seller and Parent fail to provide to the Acquiror and the Company their comments and revisions to such Tax Returns at least two (2) Business Days (and five (5) Business Days in the case of any U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise Tax Return of the Company) prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (taking into account all extensions properly obtained), the Acquiror shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed as prepared by the Acquiror. Promptly after Parent and Seller have provided their comments to such Tax Returns and taking into account the time needed by the Acquiror to review such comments, the Acquiror shall cause such Tax Returns to be amended and refiled, or otherwise file a request to correct such Tax Returns so as to reflect the comments provided by Parent or Seller. Parent and the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties against all penalties, interests, and additions to Tax that may be imposed with respect to such Tax Returns and all costs, expenses and fees incurred in amending or requesting a correction to such Tax Return and the Acquiror shall be entitled to bring an indemnity claim for such amounts as of the date such Tax Returns are filed. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) With respect to any Tax Return subject to _Section 8.02(a)(iv)_ that the Acquiror, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries are required to provide to Parent or the Seller, the Company and Transferred Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide Parent or the Seller with copies of such Tax Return by the dates required under this _Section 8.02(b)_ to the extent the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries have experienced delays in preparing such Tax Returns due to the Parents licensed software or hardware not operating properly or experiencing other technical difficulties (or due to any limitations imposed on the Companys or any Transferred Subsidiarys ability to access such software or hardware during normal business hours), and such Tax Returns shall be provided to Parent and the Seller as promptly as possible after taking into account all such delays, technical difficulties or similar limitations. 

  

 (c) To the extent the Seller, on the one hand, or the Acquiror, on the other hand, is liable under this _Article VIII_ for a Tax that is required to be paid by another party, the Company, or a Transferred Subsidiary to the relevant Tax Authority (including a Tax that is attributable to a Tax Return which is required to be filed (or caused to be filed) by the other party, the Company, or a Transferred Subsidiary), the Seller or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall pay (or cause to be paid) to such other Person the amount of its liability for such Tax under this _Article VIII_ within five (5) Business Days after receiving a written request for such payment from such other Person, and such request shall include a calculation of the amount of the other partys liability. In all other cases, an indemnity payment due under this _Article VIII_ shall be made within three (3) days after the date the matter to which such indemnity payment relates is settled, compromised or otherwise concluded. 

   

 (d) Except as required by applicable Law, a Determination, or otherwise required by any provision of this Agreement, none of the Acquiror or any Affiliate of the Acquiror or Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Seller or any Retained Affiliate shall, or shall cause or permit the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary to, amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any period of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary with respect to (i) any Pre-Closing Taxable Periods, or (ii) any Straddle Period, if such actions are likely to materially adversely affect the Parent, its Affiliates, the Seller or any Retained Affiliates on the one hand, or the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Acquiror or any of the Acquirors Affiliates on the other hand (taking into account, in each case, the indemnity set forth in this _Article VIII_), without the prior written consent of the Parent or the Acquiror, as appropriate, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any Tax Returns of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary be amended, revised or refiled pursuant to this provision if such action would be inconsistent with or contrary to the requirements of  _Section 8.07_ of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) On or prior to the Closing Date, unless otherwise requested by the Acquiror, the Parent and the Seller shall take all necessary actions so as to cause the Company and all Transferred Subsidiaries for taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date to not be included in any Tax group with the Seller, a Retained Affiliate, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (determined after the Closing Date) or in any Tax Return that is filed on a combined, consolidated, group, or unitary basis with the Seller, a Retained Affiliate, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (determined after the Closing Date). 

       ##### 

  

     

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the parties shall not be responsible or required to prepare or file (or cause to be prepared or filed) any Tax Returns for the Joint Ventures unless such Tax Returns have traditionally been prepared by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary.

 (ii) The Parent or the Seller shall notify the Acquiror in writing upon receipt by the Seller or the Parent, or any of their Affiliates of written notice of any Tax Controversy which is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liabilities of the Acquiror, its Affiliates, the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary or is reasonably likely to result in an indemnity payment under this _Article VIII_. 

   

 (iii) The failure by the Acquiror, by the Parent, or by the Seller to provide notice as required by this _Section 8.03(a)_ shall not release the indemnifying party from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such failure prejudices the defense of such claim by the indemnifying party. 

  

 (b) _Control  General Provisions_. 

    

 (i) _Sole Seller Control_. Subject to _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_ and to the additional control requirements of _Section 8.03(d)_, the Seller or its designee shall, at its expense, have the sole right to represent the Companys and each Transferred Subsidiarys interests in any Tax Controversy relating (A) solely to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or otherwise relating solely to a Tax liability for which the Seller is reasonably likely to be liable under this _Article VIII_, _provided_ , that the results of such Tax Controversy (whether favorable or unfavorable) are not reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the Acquiror (or the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary), after taking into account Sellers indemnity to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article VIII_, and any objection by the Seller with respect to such indemnity obligation, and (B) to taxable years that include the Parent Group to the extent such Tax Controversy relates solely to (x) a correction of an immaterial mathematical or posting error with respect to the Insurance Tax Reserve of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, (y) the Japanese Contingency Reserve Matter, or (z) the changes to Insurance Tax Reserves set forth in _Section 6.01(z)(xix)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,  _provided_ ,

 (ii) _Sole Acquiror Control_. Subject to _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_, the Acquiror or its designee shall, at its expense, have the sole right to represent the Companys and each Transferred Subsidiarys interests in any Tax Controversy relating solely to a Post-Closing Taxable Period or otherwise relating solely to a Tax liability for which the Acquiror is reasonably likely to be liable under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise,  _provided_ , that the results of such Tax Controversy (whether favorable or unfavorable) are not reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the Parent, the Seller or any Retained Affiliate after taking into account Acquirors indemnity to the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and any objection by the Acquiror with respect to such indemnity obligation.

period between the conclusion of such process and prior to the initiation
of the first level of judicial review of the determinations resulting

recognized counsel or non-U.S. equivalent counsel that has expertise in such
matter (and which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Acquiror) that the
Sellers position with respect to such Tax Controversy is at least "more
likely than not" (or the applicable non-U.S. equivalent level of comfort) to
succeed (and all supporting documentation relating thereto) or (B) satisfy
the requirements of _Section 8.03(d)(i)(B)_ as of the time such opinion
would have otherwise been due; or

    | (B)  |   | If a Credit Event (1) has occurred on or prior to the
conclusion of the administrative appellate process conducted by the IRS (or

Tax Controversy, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller will not be
considered to have failed to reimburse the Acquiror under this  _Section

to the amount of such disputed costs, expenses and fees into the Tax Account
or some other form of escrow or secured account established for the benefit
of the Acquiror that is agreed to by the Acquiror, with the dispute regarding
such costs, expenses and fees to be submitted to a mutually agreed upon
independent arbitrator. Upon a determination by such arbitrator with respect
to the disputed amount of costs, expenses and fees, an amount of cash equal
to the amount of such disputed costs, expenses or fees determined by the
arbitrator to be due to the Acquiror shall be released from such account to
the Acquiror and any amount of cash remaining in such account that was
deposited in respect of such disputed amounts shall be returned to the
Seller, or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | In the case where a Credit Event has occurred or
occurs at any time after the conclusion of the first level of judicial review
of a Tax Controversy, Seller does not (x) advance to the Acquiror or

the full amount required under applicable law to continue to contest such Tax
Controversy, in each case, no later than three (3) Business Days after either
the conclusion of the first level of judicial review, or if the Credit Event
occurs later, the date of such Credit Event, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that

Amount exceed the amount judicially determined to be due with respect to such
controversy  _plus_ all other reasonable out of pocket cost currently due
or reasonably likely to be incurred in connection with any future contest of
such Tax Controversy, any such excess deposits in the Tax Account will be
released to the Seller.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (iii) To the extent the Seller is not permitted to exercise joint control over the defense of a Tax Controversy due to Sellers failure to satisfy the requirements of  _Section 8.03(d)(i),_ the Acquiror shall provide to the Seller the right to participate in such Tax Controversy at the cost of the Seller, and the Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Seller informed of such Tax Controversy and provide Seller the opportunity to comment on all submissions to the relevant Tax Authority with respect to such Tax Controversy and Acquiror shall review and consider such comments in good-faith.

(" _Moody s_"). 

   

 (v) To the extent a court (or other similar Governmental Authority) at the initial level of judicial review rejects or otherwise denies an increase in the Tax liability of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary with respect to a Tax Controversy, and the Seller would have been required, but for such determination, to indemnify the Acquiror Indemnified Parties with respect to an adverse decision (the " _Decision_ "), 

  

       | (A)  |   | If a Credit Event has not occurred at any
time prior to the Decision, the provisions of _Section 8.03(d)(i)(B)_ and

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | shall not apply with respect to the appeal of the
Decision by a Tax Authority, even if a Credit Event occurs subsequent to the
Decision;  _provided_ , that if the Seller is not successful in
defending such appeal (or any other subsequent appeal by a Tax Authority)
of such Decision, the provisions of _Section 8.03(d)_ shall
become immediately applicable; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (B)  |   | if a Credit Event has occurred prior to the Decision
(1) the Acquiror shall not have the right to settle such Tax Controversy
pursuant to _Section 8.03(d)(ii)(B)_ without the consent of the Seller, and
the Acquiror and the Seller shall have the same level of control over the
defense of the initial appeal of such Decision by a Tax Authority as was in
place pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ at the time such Tax Controversy was
litigated at the first level of judicial review (or any subsequent appeal of
such Decision), and this clause (B)(1) shall continue to apply until there
has been an adverse determination at the appellate level to the relevant
taxpayer in which case the provisions of _Section 8.03(d)(ii)(B)_
shall become immediately applicable; _provided_ , that the determination of
control over the defense of any other aspect of such Tax Controversy that is
unrelated to such appeal shall continue to be governed by the provisions of
this _Section 8.03_ without regarding to this  _clause (B)_ ; and (2) but no
longer exists at any time on or after a determination by the appellate court
that confirms the correctness of the Decision for the taxpayer, then the Tax
Controversy Shortfall Amount for such controversy shall be immediately
released to the Seller upon the determination of the appellate court, 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of Section 8.03(d)(ii)(B) shall
become immediately applicable for such controversy if a Tax Authority is
subsequently able to successfully appeal the correctness of the Decision and
at such time or any time thereafter, there is a Credit Event.  
   

   

 (vi) With respect to any Tax Controversy that would be subject to Sellers sole control under _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ but for the fact that Seller takes the position that it has no liability for such matter under this Agreement, the parties agree that such matter shall be governed by the joint control provisions of _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_, subject to  _Section 8.03(d)_. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, other than with respect to the defense of any Tax Controversy that may give rise to an indemnity claim under _Section 8.07_: (i) the defense of all Tax Controversies relating to a combined, unitary, consolidated, or group Tax Return that includes the Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof shall be controlled by the Acquiror, and the Seller and the Parent shall not have any defense rights with respect to any such Tax Controversy, and (ii) the defense of any Tax Controversy relating to a combined, unitary, consolidated, or group Tax Return that includes the Parent or any Retained Affiliate shall be controlled by the Parent, and the Acquiror shall have no defense rights with 

      ##### 

  

    

respect to any such Tax Controversy; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Acquirors right to have joint control over the defense of a Tax Controversy
relating to an adjustment to the Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company or
Transferred Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall not apply to
the extent relating to taxable years that include the Parent Group to the
extent such Tax Controversy relates solely to (x) a correction of an
immaterial mathematical or posting error with respect to the Insurance Tax
Reserves of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, (y) the Japanese
Contingency Reserve Matter, or (z) the changes to Insurance Tax Reserves set
forth in  _Section 6.01(z)(xix)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (f) In the event the Seller is not permitted to exercise sole control with respect to a Tax Controversy under _Section 8.03(b)(i)_ due solely to the Sellers failure to satisfy the requirements of _Section 8.03(d)(i)_, Seller shall take all necessary actions to provide the Acquiror with its joint control rights, including providing the Acquiror the right to select with the Seller new mutually agreed upon counsel or advisors. 

   

 Section 8.04. _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of the Parent, the Seller and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to: 

  

 (a) furnish or cause to be furnished copies of all Tax Returns and other relevant information, records and documents relating to Taxes in the possession of such person relating to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective assets or their respective businesses as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or financial statements, to respond to any Tax Authority, or for the preparation for, or defense against, any Tax Controversy or other disputes regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or Straddle Periods or with respect to a liability for which any party to this Agreement or any Affiliate thereof may be liable under _Article VIII_ (including reasonable access to employees, officers, consultants, counsel, auditors and other relevant professionals); 

   

 (b) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax Authority in connection with any Tax Audit or information request with respect to any taxable period for which the other party may have a liability under  _Sections 8.01_ or _8.07_ ;

other party or any of its agents or Representatives, any books, records, Tax
Returns, schedules, work papers, or other documents or data consisting of, or
relating to, consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Returns
which include the Parent, the Seller or any Retained Affiliate, or which
include the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary), except, in each case, for materials or portions
thereof that relate solely to the Company or any of the Transferred 

      ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries or relate to the calculation of any amount of indemnity hereunder
but only to the extent related thereto provided that in no event shall the
Acquiror, the Seller or Parent have any right to obtain any Restricted
Information, other than Tax related information and pro forma Tax Returns
relating solely to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary and any
information related to any claim for indemnity under _Section 8.07(c)_,
_provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that (i) all information provided
pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ shall be subject to the obligation of
confidentiality set forth in _Section 6.05_ (but for the avoidance of doubt,
may be disclosed to any Tax Authority to the extent required by Law) and
(ii) cooperation under this _Section 8.04_ shall not be required to the
extent that such cooperation would unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of the party that has been requested to provide cooperation
pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ in light of the nature of the controversy
and the amount at stake. If reasonably requested by the Seller or the
Acquiror, the other party shall enter into a customary confidentiality and
joint defense agreement with any of the Seller, any Affiliate of the Seller,
the Acquiror, any Affiliate of the Acquiror, the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary (as appropriate) with respect to any information to be provided

cooperation pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ relates to a claim for indemnity
pursuant to _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.07_ or the preparation of Tax
Returns in accordance with _Section 8.02_, the party requesting
assistance under this _Section 8.04_ shall reimburse the assisting party
promptly for any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by such assisting
party and its Representatives in complying with any such request for
assistance. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 8.04_ shall
require the disclosure of any projection of assumptions that are not subject
to disclosure to the indemnitor under _Section 8.07(f)_. 

   

 Section 8.05. _Other Tax Covenants_.

The provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall control all matters relating to claims for indemnity in respect of Taxes (other than claims that may be made with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties under _Section 3.13_ and the covenants set forth in _Article VII_, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.20_); _provided_ , that  _Sections_ _6.05_ (as specifically referenced and modified in _Section 8.04_),  _6.24_ , _11.01(b),_ _11.05_ , _11.06_ , _11.07(a)(i)_ , _(ii)_ and  _(iii)_ , _11.07(c), 12.09, 12.10(a), 12.11, and 12.12_ shall also apply to all matters relating to claims for indemnity in respect of Taxes and none of the limitations on indemnity set forth in _Article XI_ shall apply with respect to claims for indemnity made under this  _Article VIII,_ _provided_ , _however_ , that if a claim relating to an insurance contract, policy or other product is brought against the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary that is not subject to indemnity under _Section 8.07(c)_, the parties agree such claim shall be subject to any other indemnity right that may be available to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Survival Period_. Subject to _Section 8.07_, the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.20_ (other than _Section 3.20(b)_ and  _3.20(h)_ ) and the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement with respect to any Tax matters shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of all relevant periods of limitation, and the representation and warranties set forth in _Section 3.20(b)_ and _Section 3.20(h)_ shall survive until the date that is three years after the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Tax that is imposed by any United Kingdom Tax Authority or any obligation to repay a payment 

      ##### 

  

    

made in consideration of a claim to U.K. Group Relief, all agreements,
covenants and indemnification matters contained in this _Article VIII_ and
the Sellers obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Acquiror
Indemnified Party for any such Taxes will terminate, and the representations
and warranties in _Section 3.20(gg)_ to _(pp)_ shall not survive, unless and
to the extent that a claim in respect thereof has been made no later than six
(6) years after the end of the accounting period in which the Closing Date
occurs. 

   

 (c) _Post Signing Tax Covenants_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, as of the date hereof and thereafter: 

    

 (i) The Parent and the Seller shall use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide (and update between the date hereof and the Closing Date) the Acquiror with an accurate and correct list of (A) the entities with respect to which the SPV 338 Election would likely cause a termination pursuant to section 708(b) of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and whether consent of the partners or members of such entity could be required as a result thereof or indemnity payments could be required, (B) each Transferred Subsidiary that is characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and whether such entity has in effect a valid election pursuant to section 754 of the Code, (C) any interest in a Transferred Subsidiary characterized as a partnership that has material amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction that are required to be determined under section 704(c) of the Code or the principles thereof, and (D) the Companys and each Transferred Subsidiarys (that is a U.S. person) outside tax basis and capital account amount as of the last schedule K-1 in each entity in which the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary owns an equity interest that is characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Seller and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Acquiror to determine whether it would be beneficial for the Company to have any Transferred Subsidiary make the election provided under section 754 of the Code. The Seller and Parent agree to obtain prior to the Closing Date all necessary consents that could be required as a result of the termination of a Transferred Subsidiary or any other entity under section 708(b) of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder due to the SPV 338 Election and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties against all indemnity payments resulting from any such termination. 

   

 (ii) Prior to the Closing Date, with respect to Tax matters, the Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and any such Persons respective Representatives to (A) cooperate and assist the Acquiror in continuing Tax due diligence of the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the assets, liabilities of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business including, providing access to the Acquiror and the Representatives of the Acquiror, during normal business hours, to the offices, properties, books, data, files, information, records and employees of the Seller, the Parent and their respective Affiliates but solely with respect to the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business, furnishing such additional data and other information regarding the Taxes of the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries and their personnel as the Acquiror or its Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and assisting the Acquiror in determining whether 

   ##### 

  

    

the elections described in _Section 8.05(h)_ may be beneficial to the
Acquiror and (B) cooperate with and assist the Acquiror and the
Representatives of the Acquiror in connection with the Acquirors preparation
to integrate the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business
(including any necessary restructuring of the Business) and their personnel
into the Acquirors organization following the Closing Date and with
respect to any restructuring of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries,
in each case, to the extent any such assistance or expertise is reasonably
requested in connection therewith;  _provided_ that, in each case, such
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
of the Seller, the Parent and their Affiliates, the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries, in light of the nature of the Acquirors needs and
the amount at stake. 

  

 (d) _SPV 338 Election_. 

    

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parent and the Seller shall, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, provide to the Acquiror as promptly as such information becomes available all information reasonably requested by the Acquiror relating to the SPV 338 Election, and all documents, calculations and other determinations that are reasonably requested by the Acquiror with respect thereto. As of the date hereof, Parent and the Seller intend to file the IRS Form 8883 for the SPV 338 Election in a manner consistent with the estimates set forth in _Section 3.20(o)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (it being understood that such estimate may change prior to the Closing Date as Seller, Parent and the Company continue to prepare the relevant Tax Returns relating to such election). The Seller shall reasonably consider, in good faith, any comments and suggestions by the Acquiror with respect to IRS Form 8883 and the SPV 338 Election, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the final determination of the proper consideration and allocation shall be made by the Seller. 

   

 (ii) Pursuant to the SPV 338 Election, the Seller shall timely make in the manner required by Law, where applicable, (or shall cause to be timely made) elections under section 338(g) of the Code and section 338(h)(10) of the Code, with respect to the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary and the Parent, Seller and the Company shall timely file IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 with respect to the SPV 338 Election in the manner required by Law, and such IRS Forms and the elections made thereon shall be valid, true, correct and complete. Copies of all filed IRS Forms 8883 and 8023 for the SPV 338 Election shall be provided to the Acquiror promptly after being filed. 

  

 (e) Within forty-five days (45) of the date hereof, the Seller shall provide to the Acquiror a list that specifically identifies the tax status (e.g., corporation, partnership, entity disregarded from its owner) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of each Transferred Subsidiary that is subject to Tax in the United States. 

   

 (f) Except as provided in _Section 8.07_, the Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not be restricted after the Closing Date in seeking any rulings or other legal determinations from a Tax Authority regarding the treatment of Tax items or positions with respect to Tax matters of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary that the 

      ##### 

  

    

Acquiror, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries intend to be applicable
only to Post-Closing Taxable Periods and the request or receipt of any such
rulings or determinations shall not prejudice or otherwise adversely affect
the rights of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties under this Agreement
(including the rights for indemnification set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_). 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless otherwise requested by the Acquiror, all indemnity payments to an Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be paid to the Acquiror; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to make an indemnity payment to an Acquiror Indemnified Party other than the Acquiror if such payment would materially increase the costs in respect of Tax to the Seller. 

   

 (h) _Section 338_. 

    

 (i) Upon a written request of the Acquiror, notifying the Seller of Acquirors intent to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the Company that is provided to Seller within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Seller, and the Acquiror, in respect of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, shall take all actions necessary and appropriate (including timely filing all forms, Tax Returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely section 338(g) or section 338(h)(10) election in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the requirements of section 338 of the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any corresponding elections under state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) for each of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to the acquisition of the Shares by the Acquiror and any deemed acquisitions of any other entity resulting from such elections (the " _Section 338 Elections_"). 

   

 (ii) The Seller and the Acquiror, with respect to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, agree to (x) report, where applicable, the sale of the stock of the Company (and the deemed sale of the stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to which such election is made) consistently with the Section 338 Elections and (y) with respect to the Section 338 Elections, where applicable, and to the extent permitted by Law, take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, any discussion with or proceeding before any Tax Authority, or otherwise. 

   

 (iii) On or before the Closing Date, the Seller and the Acquiror shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (x) promptly execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to one another, as appropriate, IRS Form 8023 (and any comparable state and local or non-U.S. forms) and attachments which are required to be filed under applicable Law to effect the Section 338 Elections (but not including IRS Form 8883 or any other similar form that sets forth the allocation of consideration) and the Seller shall duly and timely file such forms with the appropriate Tax Authority, and (y) comply with all requirements of section 338 of the Code (or any other similar provision of state and local law) and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Acquiror may make an election under section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary for which there was a qualified stock purchase under section 338 of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) _Allocation of Purchase Price_  

  

       | (A)  |   | For purposes of making the Section
338 Elections, the Acquiror shall determine the value of the assets of
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
and shall within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date provide the Seller with the "adjusted grossed-up basis" (within
the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under section
338 of the Code, taking into account any relevant regulations and
taking into account Notice 2010-1; 2010-2 IRB251) and its allocation to
the assets of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect
to which the Section 338 Elections are made (the " _Initial Allocation_ ").
Except as set forth below, the Initial Allocation shall be binding, as
applicable, upon the Acquiror and the Seller for purposes of allocating the
"aggregate deemed sale price" (within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury
Regulations promulgated under section 338 of the Code, taking into account
any relevant proposed regulations) among the assets of the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries for purposes of the Section 338 Elections;
_provided, however,_ that if the Seller disagrees with the Initial Allocation
and the Seller notifies the Acquiror in a writing of its specific
disagreements within forty five (45) days after having received the Initial
Allocation, the Seller and the Acquiror agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such disputed item. In the event the parties are unable to resolve
any such dispute within ten (10) Business Days (or such other period
as mutually agreed by the parties) following the written notice to
the Acquiror of the Sellers objection, a mutually agreed upon
independent nationally recognized accounting firm will be retained to
resolve solely any issue in dispute as promptly as possible by deciding
whether the valuation and related allocation of the Acquiror or the Seller
is more consistent with applicable Law, and the determination of such
firm shall be final with respect to such disputed issues. The Acquiror
and the Seller shall then be bound by the Initial Allocation as adjusted
to reflect the determination of such independent accounting firm (the "
_Final Allocation_ ") and shall bear equally all costs of the independent
accounting firm.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Initial Allocation and the Final Allocation shall be adjusted
to the extent necessary to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price
(including any adjustments that may occur after the filing of the IRS Form
8023 or 8883, and the Form 8883 (or any equivalent form) shall be amended and
revised, as needed, to reflect such adjustments) and the Final Allocation
shall be determined no later than ten (10) days prior to the filing deadline
of the IRS Form 8883 needed to reflect the Section 338 Elections. The
arbitration  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | mechanism in clause (A) above shall apply to a dispute
between the parties with respect to the determination of the Initial
Allocation and the Final Allocation.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (C)  |   | Where applicable, the Seller, the Parent and the
Acquiror shall file, and cause their respective Affiliates to file, all Tax
Returns and all forms and documents needed to effect the Section 338
Elections in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shall take no
position inconsistent therewith unless otherwise required by Law.  
   

  

 (i) _Tax Sharing Agreements, Power of Attorney_. 

    

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except in respect of any such agreement or arrangement governed by the provisions of _Section 8.05(i)(ii)_ below, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take (A) all necessary actions to terminate, or settle in accordance with the terms of _Article VI_, as the case may be, as of the day before the Closing Date, all contracts and agreements (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any arrangements in respect of Group Relief) entered into by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary that are primarily intended to provide for the allocation, sharing, or payment of Taxes (the " _Tax Sharing Agreements_ "), and (B) such actions as may be necessary so that the Company and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have no liability thereunder after the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) Within sixty (60) days of the date hereof, the Seller shall (A) provide the Acquiror with a list of all Tax Sharing Agreements that are in effect whose parties consist solely of the Company and/or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, and (B) all powers of attorney relating to significant Tax matters that will be in effect and binding on the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary after the Closing Date. Within ninety (90) days of the receipt of such lists, the Acquiror shall notify the Seller which of such agreements, arrangements or powers of attorney the Acquiror wants to survive past the Closing Date and the Seller or the Parent shall cause all other such agreements, arrangements or powers of attorney to terminate or be settled, as the case may be, on the day prior to the Closing Date so that the Company and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have no liability thereunder after the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries from and against all liabilities relating to or resulting from (A) any payments due after the Closing Date under a Tax Sharing Agreement for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, and (B) the Tax Sharing Agreements terminated pursuant to this _Section 8.05(i)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not be interpreted in any manner that would allow the Acquiror Indemnified Parties to bring a claim to recoup amounts that are paid in the settlement of an intercompany obligation under _Section 8.05(i)_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.05(i)_ is subject to the provisions of _Section 8.06_, but only with respect to Taxes imposed by a United Kingdom Tax Authority. 

  

 (j) _Contributions_. The Parent, the Seller and their Affiliates agree to treat any contribution or other transfer of assets to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary from November 30, 2009 to the Closing Date as a taxable acquisition of such asset by the Company or the Transferred Subsidiary, as the case may be. 

   

 (k) To the extent a party makes a claim for indemnity under this _Article VIII_ prior to the expiration of the relevant period of limitation, or with respect to a claim under _Section 8.07(c)(i)(B)_ , prior to December 31, 2020, such claim for indemnity (and to the extent relevant, the applicable representations and warranties) shall survive the expiration of the relevant period of limitations or, with respect to a claim brought under _Section 8.07(c)(i)(B)_ , past December 31, 2020, until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. 

   

 (l) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, except as otherwise required due to a change in Law, a Determination, settlement of a Tax Controversy, or mutual agreement by the parties, for all taxable periods commencing on or after January 1, 2009 and ending on or before December 31, 2013, the Company will calculate its life insurance qualification ratio under section 816 of the Code in a manner consistent with the calculations set forth on _Section 8.05(l)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (including the determinations and methods used in making such calculations). 

   

 (m) The Seller (at Sellers expense) shall cause the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to have prepared and completed as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than September 1, 2011 all necessary studies and other reports that are needed to comply with the requirements of section 482 of the Code and similar transfer pricing provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law. Such reports and studies shall be completed by a consultant or advisor that is an expert in these areas and that is mutually agreed upon by the Parent and the Acquiror and consistent with the Acquirors transfer pricing methodologies; _provided_ , _however_ , that no indemnity shall be provided under _Article VIII_ by the Seller to the extent of any Tax or Losses (other than the cost of preparing the studies and reports) resulting from the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries using the Acquirors transfer pricing methodologies developed in accordance with this _Section 8.05(m)_. 

   

 (n) The following claims for indemnity under this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as such for purposes of determining the Reserved Amount: (i) all claims with respect to a Tax Controversy, provided, the Acquiror satisfies the requirements of _Section 8.03(a)_ and the relevant Tax Authority has provided a written notice to the relevant taxpayer asserting a liability for Tax or the loss of Tax benefit that the Acquiror Indemnified Parties have determined has given, or could reasonably give rise to, a right of indemnification under this _Article VIII_; (ii) all claims for Taxes (including any amounts required to be paid in the form of a reimbursement or compensation for Taxes) resulting from any claim or demand by a third party (other than a Tax Authority) for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties have determined has given, or could reasonably give rise to, a right of indemnification under _Section 8.01(a)(vi)_;  _provided_ , notice is provided to the Seller by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties of such claim within the time and in 

      ##### 

  

    

the manner set forth in _Section 8.03(a)_; and (iii) any claim for Losses by
an Acquiror Indemnified Party against the Seller pursuant to _Section
8.01(a)(vii)_ that is asserted by an Acquiror Indemnified Party by written
notice to Seller and that does not involve an actual or imminent Tax
Controversy, and such notice sets forth the reasonably expected amount of such
Losses. 

   

 Section 8.06. _Tax Relief_. 

  

 (a) If the Seller elects in its sole discretion, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the Seller shall be permitted to procure the surrender of Group Relief from itself or the Parent or their Retained Affiliates to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary in order to prevent or extinguish a liability for Taxes arising for which it would be liable under _Article VIII_ , _provided_ that no payment shall be due from the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary in respect of such claim. The Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary to, take all steps reasonably requested to effect any such claim. 

   

 (b) Subject to paragraph (i) below, the Acquiror shall, at the written request of the Seller, procure that the Company and any Transferred Subsidiaries shall, to the extent legally permissible, claim Group Relief from the company or companies stated in the aforementioned written request for a consideration calculated in accordance with paragraph (ii) below. 

    

 (i) The Acquiror shall have no obligations under this _Section 8.06(b)_ to pay consideration if and to the extent it would otherwise be calculated by reference to Tax in respect of which the Seller is liable under _Article VIII_. 

   

 (ii) The consideration to be provided in accordance with _Section 8.06(b)_ above shall be an amount equal to: 

  

       | (A)  |   | in the case of a Group Relief claim in
relation to an accounting period of the Company or the relevant
Transferred Subsidiary other than the Straddle Period, an amount equal to
any amount of Tax for which the Company or that Transferred Subsidiary would
otherwise be liable in respect of the relevant accounting period and which is
reduced or eliminated (whether by way of refund, credit, offset or discharge)
as a consequence of the Group Relief claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

       | (B)  |   | in the case of a Group Relief claim in
relation to the Straddle Period, an amount equal to any amount of Tax
duly apportioned in accordance with _Section 8.06(b)(iii)(D)_ to the part
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date for which the Company or
the relevant Transferred Subsidiary would otherwise be liable in respect of
that accounting period and which is reduced or eliminated (whether by way of
refund, credit, offset or discharge) as a consequence of the Group Relief
claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (iii) The Acquiror will procure that: 

  

       | (A)  |   | the Company and all Transferred
Subsidiaries will co-operate with the Seller in relation to any claim made
under this _Section 8.06(b)_ by promptly taking all such action as
the Seller may reasonably request, including the making of all necessary and
reasonable claims, the giving of all necessary and reasonable consents and
the execution and filing of all necessary and reasonable notifications and
returns;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | except to the extent that profits are not available to
be the subject of a Group Relief claim, neither the Company nor any
Transferred Subsidiary without the prior written consent of the Seller (not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) withdraws or varies or otherwise
impedes any Group Relief claim made pursuant to this _Section 8.06(b)_;  
      
    | (C)  |   | the Company and all Transferred Subsidiaries shall
provide the Seller with all such information and assistance as the Seller may

_Section 8.06(b)_;  
      
    | (D)  |   | the Company and each Transferred Subsidiary,
in relation to a claim made under this _Section 8.06(b)_ to which it is a
party in respect of the Straddle Period, shall compute and apportion its
total profits in respect of the parts of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and beginning after the Closing Date on a time apportionment
basis, unless and to the extent that such a basis would be unjust or
unreasonable, in which case (to the extent only that it is necessary in order
to avoid injustice or unreasonableness) in such other manner as may be just
and reasonable in the circumstances.  
   

   

 (iv) The consideration for a Group Relief claim made pursuant to this _Section 8.06(b)_ shall be payable, in a case where the Group Relief claim gives rise to a repayment of Tax, to the extent that the consideration is attributable to such repayment, on the date two (2) Business Days after such repayment has been made; or in any other case, on the last date on which any actual Tax liability which is reduced or eliminated as 

   ##### 

  

    

a consequence of the Group Relief claim would have been required to have
otherwise been paid to the relevant Tax Authority in order to avoid any
interest or penalty. The Acquiror shall pay such consideration, or procure
that it is paid, to the company or companies from which Group Relief, to
which that consideration relates, is claimed and in accordance with an
agreement between that company or those companies, on the one hand and, on the
other hand, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiary which is party to the
relevant Group Relief claim, and in the event that any Group Relief claim is
disallowed to any extent by the relevant Tax Authority, the Seller shall
procure that such consideration as has been paid in respect of such claim (to
the extent disallowed) shall promptly be repaid to the Company, or to the
relevant Transferred Subsidiary to which such claim related, together with
interest thereon calculated at the Interest Rate from the date of the payment
to the date of repayment. 

  

 (c) The Acquiror undertakes to the Seller that the Acquiror will, if requested in writing by the Seller to do so, procure that the Company and any Transferred Subsidiary so far as it is legally able to do so shall use its best endeavors to permit a claim for Group Relief by the Seller, the Parent or any Retained Affiliate for no consideration other than any consideration that has been paid on or prior to Closing in respect of the Straddle Period and/or any accounting period of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary ended on or before the Closing and the Acquiror covenants with the Seller that if to any extent the Acquiror is in breach of such undertaking it will pay to the Seller an amount equal to any Tax or any additional Tax which may be or becomes payable by the Seller, the Parent or any Retained Affiliate which would not have been payable if the Acquiror had complied in full with such undertaking, provided that this _Section 8.06(c)_ shall not apply to permit a claim for Group Relief and the Acquiror shall have no liability to the Seller under this _Section 8.06(c)_ to the extent that (x) any such claim would otherwise relate to any amount treated as an asset in, or taken into account in computing, the provision for Tax in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or (y) any such claim for Group Relief would, if made, give rise to a liability for Tax by virtue of the reallocation and surrender by way of Group Relief of amounts that have already been utilized by any Company or any Transferred Subsidiary and in respect of which the Acquiror would be entitled to make a claim against the Seller or the Parent under this  _Article VIII_. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.01(b)_, neither the Parent, the Seller, nor any Retained Affiliate shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit or allowance for) Taxes which arise in consequence of a surrender of Group Relief made for a consideration payable under _Section 8.06(b)_. 

   

 (e) Except as set forth in _Sections 8.01(a)_ and _Section 8.07_, the Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties, from and against all Taxes imposed by a United Kingdom Tax Authority on the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, or for which the Seller or an Affiliate thereof is accountable in respect of the income, profits or gains of, or events relating to the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, Taxes imposed by a United Kingdom Tax Authority attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 Section 8.07. _Special Indemnification Provisions_. With the exception of Excluded Taxes: 

  

 (a) (i) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and against: 

   

       | (A)  |   | all Taxes (and lost Tax benefits, to the Company
and Transferred Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary, or with respect to which the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, relating to or resulting from a
Determination, settlement or agreement between the Seller and the Acquiror
that there is an inaccuracy, miscalculation or any adjustment to the
Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary (to the
extent maintained for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with respect to
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date,
and all reasonable out of pocket costs, expenses, fees and other reasonable
out of pocket amounts incurred after the Closing Date in contesting,
determining, investigating, or settling any matter for which a claim for
indemnity may be made hereunder (including, all costs incurred in correcting
or remediating any Pre-Closing Contracts or Post-Closing
Contracts, including all reasonable costs and expenses for legal or
other professional consultants));  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | subject to _Section 8.07(a)(ii)_ below, 50 percent of
(1) all Taxes (and lost Tax benefits), imposed on the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary, or with respect to which the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, relating to, or resulting
from a Determination, settlement or agreement between the Seller and the
Acquiror with respect to the inaccuracy, miscalculation or any adjustment to
the Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary (to
the extent maintained for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with respect to
taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date and
ending on or before December 31, 2013, with respect to Pre-Closing Contracts,
and Post-Closing Contracts entered into on or before December 31, 2013,
and (2) all reasonable out of pocket costs, expenses, fees and
other reasonable out of pocket amounts incurred after the Closing Date
in contesting, determining, investigating, or settling any matter for which
a claim for indemnity may be made hereunder (including, all costs incurred in
correcting or remediating any Pre-Closing Contracts or Post-Closing
Contracts, including all reasonable costs and expenses for legal or other
professional consultants) (sub-clauses _(A)_ and  _(B)_ ,collectively, "
_Reserve Tax Losses_ ").  
   

    ##### 

 

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no indemnity shall be required under
clause (B) of this provision to the extent the Company or a Transferred
Subsidiary, as applicable, fails to follow, after the Closing Date, the
reserve methodologies used by the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary with
respect to the Pre-Closing Contracts and Post-Closing Contracts in all
material respects, but only to the extent such methodology is
reasonably unambiguous to the Acquiror, and if such methodology does not
satisfy the above criteria, the Acquiror, after consulting with the Parent,
shall provide the Seller with a methodology reasonably consistent with the
methodology Acquiror believes was used by the Company or such Transferred
Subsidiary (based on the information provided by the Parents, the Companys,
or Transferred Subsidiarys tax personnel that were employed prior to the
Closing Date by the Company or such Transferred Subsidiary) with respect to
the Pre-Closing Contracts and shall substantially follow such methodology in
all material respects, and _provided_   _further_ , that the indemnity
provided hereunder shall not be lost or adversely affected in any manner by
any change in reserve materially agreed to by Parent and the Acquiror or
which is required due to a Determination, settlement, or an agreement
between Seller and the Acquiror, or a change in Law (other than a Prospective
Change of Law that is effective after the Closing Date) or a change that is
consistent with the changes set forth on _Section 6.01(z)(xix)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, (2) no indemnity shall be required of the Seller
under clause (B) of this provision in excess of a payment by the Seller of
$200 million, and (3) no indemnity shall be required with respect to an
adjustment to the Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries that is made by the Company or Transferred Subsidiary pursuant
to and as permitted by _Section 6.01(z)(xix)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(the " _Reserve Tax Indemnity_ "). 

   

 (ii) For purposes of calculating the amount of the Reserve Tax Losses, the amount of the Reserve Tax Losses shall take into account all Tax benefits and Tax detriments (in the same manner as such amounts are taken into account in _Section 8.07(f)_) resulting to the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable, due to the adjustment to Insurance Tax Reserves for which a claim for indemnity has been made. The calculation of the Reserve Tax Losses shall be made by the Acquiror and shall be provided to the Seller. In the event that the Seller does not agree with the Acquirors computation of the adjustments to the calculation of the Reserve Tax Losses required under this clause (ii), the Acquiror and the Seller agree to follow the dispute resolution mechanism as set forth in _Section 8.07(f)_ , below. 

   

 (iii) The indemnification provided in this _Section 8.07(a)_ shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of all relevant periods of limitations, including the relevant periods of limitation with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable Period subject to the indemnification under _Section 8.07(a)(i)_. 

   

 (iv) Parent and the Seller agree that to the extent there is a Determination that results in an adjustment to the Companys or a Transferred Subsidiarys Insurance Tax Reserves for which a claim for indemnity is made pursuant to _Section 8.07(a)_, none of the parties shall be prohibited from taking the position that the adjustments to the taxable income and Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary resulting from such Determination should be made on the then 

   ##### 

  

    

earliest taxable period that includes the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary that is open for assessment and, to the extent the parties agree
with such position or there is a Determination that is consistent with such
position, the parties and the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, as the
case may be, shall (or shall cause) all Tax Returns of or that include the
Company or any relevant Transferred Subsidiary for such taxable period to be
amended and re-filed. 

  

 (b) (i) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and against (A) all Taxes (and lost Tax benefits) imposed on the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, or with respect to which the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, with respect to any taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date resulting from or relating to a Determination, or a settlement or agreement between the Seller and the Acquiror, that there is or has been a breach or inaccuracy of the representation set forth in _Section 3.20(s)_; (B) all Taxes (and lost Tax benefits) imposed on the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, or with respect to which the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, with respect to any taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date and ending on or before December 31, 2013 (the " _Special Indemnity Period_ ") resulting from or relating to a Determination, or a settlement or agreement between the Seller and the Acquiror, that during all or a portion of the Special Indemnity Period the Company does not qualify as a life insurance company within the meaning of section 816(a) of the Code, provided that this sub-clause (B) shall only apply if (y) applying the analysis set forth in such Determination, settlement or agreement, except as expressly provided in _Section 8.07(b)(ii)_ below, the representation set forth in _Section 3.20(s)_ of this Agreement would have been treated as breached for the taxable period of the Company ending on December 31, 2008, and (z) applying solely the portion of the analysis set forth in such Determination, settlement or agreement, that is based on the Prospective Change of Law, if any, the Company would qualify as a life insurance company within the meaning of section 816(a) of the Code; and (C) all reasonable out of pocket costs, expenses, fees and other reasonable out of pocket amounts incurred after the Closing Date in contesting, determining, investigating, or settling any matter for which a claim for indemnity may be made hereunder (including all reasonable costs and expenses for legal or other professional consultants). 

    

 (ii) Solely for purposes of the indemnity provided in _Section 8.07(b)(i)(B)_, if a Determination is made during the Special Indemnity Period that the Company does not qualify as a life insurance company under section 816(a) of the Code (or any successor provisions thereto) and there has been a change in the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder that is effective after the Closing Date and prior to such Determination, and such change in the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or the relevant Determination, expressly provides that the change is to have only prospective effect and such change clearly is not applicable with respect to periods prior to such change (a " _Prospective Change of Law_ "), then the analysis applied to determine whether the Company qualified as a life insurance company for purposes of section 816(a) of the Code for the taxable period ending on December 31, 2008 shall be made as though such change in the Code or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder had not occurred. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) To the extent that a Pre-Closing Taxable Period of the Company has been audited by the IRS and the IRS did not conclude that the Company failed to qualify as a life insurance company under section 816(a) of the Code at such time and the IRS does not thereafter conclude that the Company is not a life insurance company for such taxable period, then an indemnity claim by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for Taxes (and lost Tax benefits) resulting from an adjustment to the Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company in a Post-Closing Taxable Period that results from the IRS concluding that the Company was not a life insurance company in such audited Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall not be subject to the indemnity provided under _Section 8.07(b)(i)(B)_ but shall be subject to the indemnity provided under _Section 8.07(a)(i)(B)_ for taxable periods ending on or before December 31, 2013. 

   

 (iv) Except as provided in _Section 8.07(b)(iii)_, to the extent a claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Section 8.07(b)_ could also be subject to the provisions of _Section 8.07(a)(i)_, the Sellers indemnity obligation shall be determined in accordance with _Section 8.07(b)_ and shall not be subject to the limitations on indemnity set forth in _Section 8.07(a)_. 

   

 (v) For purposes of calculating the amount of an indemnity required to be paid pursuant to this provision, the provisions of _Section 8.07(f)_ shall apply. 

   

 (vi) The indemnification provided in this _Section 8.07(b)_ shall survive until the date that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of all relevant periods of limitation, including with respect to any Post-Closing Taxable Period subject to the indemnification under _Section 8.07(b)(i)(B)_. 

  

 (c) (i) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties from and against, and reimburse the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for: 

   

       | (A)  |   | all Losses and other amounts relating to
or resulting from all claims, Determinations, Tax Controversies,
Actions (whether current or pending), investigations, or other proceedings
that have been asserted or commenced against the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date by or on behalf of a
holder, beneficial owner or beneficiary of a Pre-Closing Contract or by
a Governmental Authority regarding the failure of any Pre-Closing Contract
to provide to a holder, beneficial owner, or beneficiary of such contract a
Tax benefit relating to such contract that was set forth in the Companys or
a Transferred Subsidiarys marketing materials for such contract or was
otherwise promised in writing by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary with
respect to such contract (including with respect to payments made or received
on such contract), and (2) all reasonable out of pocket external expenses,
fees, and costs, including any return of premium or change in benefit,
costs incurred to create substitute forms, or Taxes (including any
death, estate or inheritance taxes and any amounts paid in the form of a  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | gross-up for Taxes), toll charges or other similar
amounts paid to a Governmental Authority or to the holder, beneficial owner
or beneficiary of any such contract, incurred by the Company or
any Transferred Subsidiary to correct, amend or take any other action needed
so as to cause all Pre-Closing Contracts subject to a Pre-Closing Product
Claim and, to the extent permitted under  _Section 8.07(c)(ii)_ all Pre-
Closing Contracts that are substantially similar to the terms of the
contracts that gave rise to the Pre-Closing Product Claim (a " _Pre-Closing
Product Claim_ ");  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (B)  |   | Other than with respect to a Pre-Closing Product
Claim (1) all Losses and other amounts that are required to be paid to a
holder, beneficial owner or beneficiary of a Pre-Closing Contract or to a
Governmental Authority based on a Determination, a settlement or other
conclusion of a claim brought by a holder, beneficial owner, or beneficiary
of a Pre-Closing Contract or by a Governmental Authority regarding the
failure of any Pre-Closing Contract to provide to a holder, beneficial owner,
or beneficiary of such contract a Tax benefit relating to such contract that
was set forth in the Companys or a Transferred Subsidiarys
marketing materials for such contract or was otherwise promised in writing by
the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary with respect to such
contract (including with respect to payments made or received on such
contract), and (2) all reasonable out of pocket external expenses, fees,
and costs, including any return of premium or change in benefit,
costs incurred to create substitute forms, or Taxes (including any
death, estate or inheritance taxes and any amounts paid in the form of
a gross-up for Taxes), toll charges or other similar amounts paid to
a Governmental Authority or to the holder, beneficial owner or beneficiary
of any such contract, incurred by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary
to correct, amend or take any other action needed so as to cause all Pre-
Closing Contracts subject to indemnity under clause (B)(1) above, and, to the
extent permitted under  _Section 8.07(c)(ii)_ all Pre-Closing Contracts that
are substantially similar to the terms of the contracts that gave rise
to the Post-Closing Product Claim (a " _Post-Closing Product Claim_
") (collectively, clauses (B)(1) and (B)(2), the " _Costs_ "),  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquiror, the Company and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall in good faith attempt to use internal
resources before incurring external fees or costs and there shall be excluded
from the term Costs with respect to a Post-Closing Product Claim, (y) Costs
in respect of Pre-Closing Contracts with respect to which the issue or
deficiency relating to the contracts that gave rise to a Post-Closing Product
Claim was determined to not exist as of the Closing Date by the court or
Governmental Authority presiding over the controversy that gave rise to such
claim and (z) Costs in respect of products that are noncompliant due solely
to (A) changes in (1) Tax Law or (2) published 

   ##### 

  

    

Tax Authority interpretations thereof, in either case, occurring after the
Closing Date with prospective effect, or (B) the Acquiror, the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries disclosing or informing a holder, beneficial owner,
beneficiary or a Governmental Authority of the failure of a Pre-Closing
Contract to provide to its holder, beneficial owner, or beneficiary Tax
benefits that would give rise to a claim for indemnity under this  _Section
8.07(c)(i)_, (other than any such action that is permitted under
_Section 8.07(c)(ii)_ ) or if such information is required to be provided by
a Governmental Authority. 

   

 (ii) To the extent that there is a successful claim by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for indemnity with regard to either a Pre-Closing Product Claim or a Post-Closing Product Claim and the resolution of such claim was pursuant to a decision by a judicial authority, Governmental Authority or contractual settlement that, in each case, is not the subject of a right to non-disclosure by contract or applicable Law, if the Acquiror so requests, the Acquiror and the Parent shall cause the Company or relevant Transferred Subsidiary to seek a determination from a relevant Governmental Authority as to whether Pre-Closing Contracts that are substantially similar to the contract for which there was a successful claim for indemnity pursuant _Section 8.07(c)(i)(A)_ or _(B)_ above also fail to provide to the holders, beneficial owners, or beneficiaries of such contracts the Tax benefits that gave rise to the related Pre-Closing Product Claim or Post-Closing Product Claim. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent permitted by Law) to provide for limitations with respect to any disclosure of (1) any contractual settlement and (2) any court proceeding or court settlement, in each case, involving a claim that may affect a claim for indemnity under _Section 8.07(c)_. The process for seeking this determination shall be treated as a matter that is subject to the provisions of _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_. The determination provided by such Governmental Authority shall be binding on the Seller, the Acquiror and Parent and the Company and Transferred Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary so as to comply with the determination provided by the Governmental Authority without objection from Parent or Seller and without prejudice to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties rights under this Agreement (including under _Section 8.07(c)_ above). 

   

 (iii) In the event a claim for indemnity is brought under _Section 8.07(c)(i)(B)_ that is not settled or concluded prior to December 31, 2013, the parties agree that with respect to the Costs described in clause (B)(1) of such term, the Seller shall only be liable for the portion of such Costs that are allocable to the periods ending on before December 31, 2013. The parties will attempt to allocate such Costs between the periods ending on or before December 31, 2013 and the period beginning on January 1, 2014 by determining the amount of such Costs that would have been due had such claim been settled or concluded as of December 31, 2013 (assuming such claim would have been settled or concluded in the same manner and based upon the same facts and circumstances as existed when the claim was actually settled or concluded at the actual later date (provided facts and circumstances relating to build-up in policy value and future death benefits accumulating after December 31, 2013, shall not be taken into account)). The parties agree if a Cost described in clause (B)(1) for such indemnity claim cannot be allocated pursuant to the forgoing sentence, the amount of such Costs that will be allocated to the Seller shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of such 

   ##### 

  

    

Costs by a fraction with a numerator equal to the total amount of premium paid
on such contract (or contracts) prior to December 31, 2013 and a denominator
equal to the total amount of premium paid on such contract (or contracts)
through the date of settlement or final judgment (such total amounts reduced
to take into account any forgiveness or cancellation of premium with respect
to such contract and to take into account any premiums that will not be paid
due to such contract being surrendered, cancelled or otherwise terminated
that would otherwise have been included in such amount) prior to the date
of settlement or time of judgment. 

   

 (iv) With respect to any matter for which a claim for indemnity under _Section 8.07(c)(i)_ may be brought, the defense of the claim, investigation, Action, Audit, or Tax Controversy relating to such matter shall be subject to _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_. 

   

 (v) Claims for indemnity under this _Section 8.07(c)_ are required to be made on or prior to December 31, 2020, provided, that for purposes of this Agreement the parties agree that any claim for indemnity for Pre-Closing Product Claims will be treated as brought on the Closing Date. 

   

 (vi) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the determination of whether Pre-Closing Contracts are substantially similar shall not take into account the fact that such contracts are held, owned, involve or are for the benefit of different parties. 

  

 (d) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold the Acquiror Indemnified Parties harmless against all withholding Taxes imposed pursuant to sections 871, 881, 1441, 1442 and 1461 of the Code on Covered Payments as defined in the Withholding Tax Closing Agreement for all periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2013, except to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the Withholding Tax Closing Agreement being terminated or held to be invalid due to actions taken by the Acquiror or the Company after the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) Other than with respect to a breach of a covenant (except for a breach of the covenant in  _Section 8.02(b)(iii)(z)_ with respect to the truthfulness and correctness of the Tax Returns), which shall be subject to _Section 8.01_, the indemnities provided in _Sections 8.07(a)-(d)_ shall be the exclusive indemnity and remedy with respect to the Companys and Transferred Subsidiarys Insurance Tax Reserves, the life company qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the Company, the failure of Pre-Closing Contracts to provide Tax benefits to holders, beneficial owners or beneficiaries thereof, and withholding taxes imposed on Covered Payments under section 871, 881, 1441, 1442 and 1461 of the Code (collectively, the " _Covered Matters_ "), and there will be no additional indemnity or remedy with respect to such matters under this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) a claim for indemnity under _Article XI_ may be brought with respect to a breach of any representation concerning product qualification (other than with respect to a breach of a representation in _Section 3.20_), and (ii) that the procedural and related aspects of _Section 8.01_ shall continue to apply to these matters. 

  

 (f) (i) _General_. The amount of any indemnity payable under this _Article VIII_ shall be determined on an "after-tax basis." For purposes of determining an indemnity payment under this Agreement that is to be determined on an "after-tax basis," the amount of any Loss, Tax or other amount that is incurred or suffered by an indemnitee (the " _Loss Amount_ ") as a 

   ##### 

  

    

result of an Indemnity Event shall be adjusted so as to reflect the aggregate
Tax benefits and Tax detriments (as determined in accordance with _Section
8.07(f)(ii)_ below) (collectively, the " _Tax Adjustments_ ") to the
indemnitee and its Affiliates resulting from the Indemnity Event that gave
rise to such Loss Amount, so that after taking into account such Tax
Adjustments the indemnitee receives an indemnity payment under this Agreement
in an amount reasonably anticipated to place the indemnitee and its
Affiliates in the same economic position with respect to Taxes that they
would have occupied had the indemnitee not suffered or incurred the
Loss Amount; _provided_ , that in no event shall the net amount of the
indemnity payment made with respect to an Indemnity Event (including all
adjustments made with respect to, or relating to, such Indemnity Event )
under this Agreement at any time be reduced below zero (0) as a result of the
Tax Adjustments. An " _Indemnity Event_ " shall mean (x) the specific item,
event, circumstance, failure to act or other situation that gave rise to the
claim for indemnity, and (y) the receipt or accrual of the indemnity payment.
Once finally determined in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
8.07(f)_, the Tax Adjustments with respect to an Indemnity Event (including
all related adjustments made with respect to such event) shall not be
redetermined based on the failure of any of the assumptions or projections
used in determining such Tax Adjustments actually to come to pass. 

   

 (ii) _Assumptions and Projections_. The Tax benefits and Tax detriments resulting from the occurrence of an Indemnity Event shall take into account (1) the current and prior Tax benefits and Tax detriments, and (2) the present value of all reasonably anticipated future Tax benefits and Tax detriments, to an indemnitee, any Affiliate of the indemnitee to the extent such Affiliate realizes or is reasonably anticipated to realize a Tax benefit or Tax detriment as result of the Indemnity Event, and any Tax benefits or Tax detriments resulting from an Indemnity Event that are realized or reasonably anticipated to be realized by any consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group of which the indemnitee or Affiliate is a member at the relevant time, subject to all limitations or restrictions that may be imposed by Law on such realization. In calculating the future Tax benefits and future Tax detriments resulting from an Indemnity Event, such Tax benefits and Tax detriments shall be projected until such time as no material Tax benefits or Tax detriments are expected to remain. Such calculation shall use and be based upon (A) the assumptions and projections used for purposes of preparing the indemnitees and its Affiliates business projections actually used by such Persons in conducting their business, (B) for periods, if any, not covered by (A), the assumptions and projections used for purposes of preparing the indemnitees and its Affiliates cashflow testing analyses contained in actuarial memoranda prepared in support of such entities regulatory financial statements for the relevant periods, and (C) for periods, if any, not covered by (A) or (B), the indemnitees and its Affiliates good faith estimates using, to the extent relevant, reasonable extrapolations of the assumptions, projections and methodologies employed in (A) and (B) (the " _Assumed Financial Projections_ "). The Tax benefits and Tax detriments over the period covered by the Assumed Financial Projections plus any relevant prior periods shall be determined by comparing (Y) the amount of Taxes that the indemnitee, any relevant Affiliate and any relevant consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group would have paid and would have been reasonably anticipated to pay in the absence of the occurrence of the Indemnity Event to (Z) the amount of Taxes that the indemnitee, any relevant Affiliate and any relevant consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group would have paid and are 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably anticipated to pay taking into account the Indemnity Event. The
present value shall be based on a discount rate determined at the time the
indemnity payment is due, equal to the indemnitees normal borrowing rate at
such time for senior debt having a term that most nearly corresponds to the
weighted average time over which the relevant Tax benefits and Tax detriments
are reasonably anticipated to be realized. The future projections of Tax
benefits and Tax detriments shall be based on the application of the highest
applicable income tax rates (including federal, state, local and any
other applicable rates) in effect in the relevant jurisdiction for the
relevant year that are in effect when the relevant determination is made. 

   

 (iii) _Dispute Settlement_. Unless impractical or otherwise agreed by the parties acting reasonably and in good faith, no less than 60 days prior to the date on which the relevant indemnity payment is otherwise due, the indemnitee shall provide the indemnitor a reasonably detailed calculation of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_ , (the " _Indemnitee Adjustments_ ") and, subject to clause (iv) below, a description of the assumptions and projections used for purposes of such calculations (collectively, the " _Tax Benefits and Detriments Notice_"). To the extent that, taking into account the provisions of clause (iv) below, the indemnitor disagrees with the indemnitees calculation of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_ included in the Tax Benefits and Detriments Notice, the indemnitor shall provide written notice of its objection (including a reasonably detailed calculation of the adjustments the indemnitor reasonably believes are required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_) to the indemnitee no later than forty-five (45 ) days (plus any extension thereof that is agreed by the parties acting reasonably and in good faith) after receipt of (A) the Tax Benefits and Detriments Notice and (B) all relevant information reasonably requested by the Indemnitor Accounting Firm, if any, within thirty (30) days of the engagement of such firm (the " _Review Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor Accounting Firm may reasonably request further relevant information after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period but neither such request nor the receipt of information pursuant to such request shall extend the Review Period. To the extent that the parties cannot agree on the amount of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_, the disputed items shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed by the parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Such firm shall decide as promptly as practicable, but in all events (unless otherwise agreed by the parties, acting reasonably and in good faith) within forty-five (45) days of the time after the indemnitee and the Indemnitor Accounting Firm have presented their final positions regarding the amount of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_, whether the position of the indemnitee or the indemnitor is more correct. The cost of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally between the parties and the determination of such accounting firm shall be binding on the parties. In the event that a court is determining or has determined the Loss Amount and is also determining or has determined the adjustment to such Loss Amount to determine the "after tax basis" of such Loss Amount, then the provisions of _Section 8.07(iii)_ (other than this sentence) and _Section 8.07(iv)_ shall not apply and the adjustment as set forth in a determination by such a court that is final and no longer subject to appeal shall be treated for all purposes of this _Section 8.07(f)_ as an agreement by the parties as to such adjustment. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) _Information Sharing_. The parties shall provide to each other, to the Independent Accounting Firm and to the Indemnitor Accounting Firm (as defined below) all documentation and cooperation (including reasonable access to personnel) that is necessary to timely evaluate the Tax Benefits and Detriments Notice or to resolve any dispute with respect to the calculation of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_ (including all information that supports the positions taken by each party and all information necessary to establish that the assumptions and projections have followed the requirements of this _Section 8.07(f))_; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such information is non-public information regarding the indemnitee or any of its Affiliates (the " _Restricted Information_ "), the indemnitee and any relevant Affiliate thereof shall not be required to provide such information to the indemnitor under this  _Section 8.07(f)_, but shall be required to provide such information for review to Deloitte and Touche LLP, or if Deloitte and Touche LLP is unwilling or unable to serve, to another independent accounting firm appointed by the indemnitor and reasonably acceptable to the indemnitee, acting on behalf of the indemnitor (the " _Indemnitor Accounting Firm_ "). The Indemnitor Accounting Firm shall not disclose the Restricted Information to the indemnitor and shall enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with the indemnitee to such effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor Accounting Firm shall be permitted to disclose to the indemnitor whether the calculation of the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)(i)_ and the assumptions and projections reflected in the Tax Benefits and Detriments Notice have been made in the manner required by this _Section 8.07(f)_ and the general reasons for such determination. The Indemnitor Accounting Firm shall be permitted to disclose any information to the Independent Accounting Firm for purposes of performing the calculation of the adjustments required under  _Section 8.07(f)(i)_ or settling any dispute under _Section 8.07(f)(iii)_ (it being understood that, unless agreed by the indemnitee, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not disclose to the indemnitor the Restricted Information, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with the indemnitee to this effect). 

   

 (v) _Payment_. The parties agree that any amount payable by an indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement, that is to be paid on an after-tax basis, shall be paid when the indemnity payment is otherwise due under the terms of this Agreement (the " _Due Date_ "), except that if, on the Due Date, the parties have not agreed on the adjustments required under _Section 8.07(f)_, the indemnitor shall be required to pay to the indemnitee on the Due Date the Loss Amount as adjusted to reflect the amount of adjustments the parties have then agreed upon acting reasonably and in good faith, and the indemnitor shall deposit the positive difference, if any, between (A) the Loss Amount as adjusted for the Indemnitee Adjustments less such paid amount and (B) the amount of any Available Escrow Amount or Tax Account (such positive difference, if any, the " _Remainder Amount_ ") in a separate escrow account (the " _Separate Escrow Account_ ") established for the benefit of the indemnitee with terms and conditions substantially similar to the Indemnification Collateral Account Security and Control Agreement. Upon the settlement of a dispute by the parties or a decision being rendered by an Independent Accounting Firm, there shall be distributed to the indemnitee from the Indemnification Collateral Account and, to the extent relevant, the Separate Escrow Account , the amount needed to reflect such settlement or decision no later than four (4) days after such 

   ##### 

  

    

settlement or decision (together with any earnings on the released amounts so
distributed that accrued during the time such released amounts were deposited
in the escrow), and all remaining amounts thereafter, if any, shall be paid
back to the indemnitor or remain in the Indemnification Collateral Account or
Tax Account, as applicable. 

  

 (g) Unless otherwise required by a change in Law with prospective effect, a Determination, or unless mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Acquiror (including any changes set forth in  _Section 6.01(z)(xix)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter), in computing the Insurance Tax Reserves for taxable periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009 and ending on or before the Closing Date, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries will use reserve methodologies and determinations that are similar in all material respects to the reserve methodologies and determinations used in determining the Companys and the Transferred Subsidiarys Insurance Tax Reserves for the taxable period ending on December 31, 2008 and none of Parent, Seller or Acquiror shall (or shall cause) any positions contrary or inconsistent with this concept to be taken; provided, however, that the Acquiror, Parent, the Seller, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have the right to adjust the Insurance Tax Reserves of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to the extent such adjustments relate solely to the correction of immaterial mathematical or posting errors or result from the Japanese Contingency Reserve Matter. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the rights of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties under this Agreement (including with respect to indemnity) shall not be prejudiced or adversely affected by any Acquiror Indemnified Party taking any action that is permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be required to take any action to mitigate its damages under this _Article VIII_ to the extent such actions are not permitted under this _Article VIII_.

 Section 11.04. _Notification of Claims_. 

  

 (a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _Article XI_, including any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party whether by litigation, arbitration or otherwise) (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and 

   ##### 

  

    

circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article XI_ except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such claim by the Indemnifying Party. Any indemnifiable
claim that is not a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice to
the Indemnifying Party. The parties agree that (i) in this _Article XI_ they
intend to shorten (in the case of the limited survival periods specified in
_Section 11.01_) and lengthen (in the case of the indefinite survival
periods specified in _Section 11.01_) (as the case may be) the
applicable statute of limitations period with respect to certain claims; (ii)
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty
must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in _Section 11.01_ for such representation or warranty; and (iii)
any claims for indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered in
accordance with this _Section 11.04(a)_ shall be expressly barred and are
hereby waived;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if, prior to such applicable
date, a party hereto shall have notified the other party hereto in accordance
with the requirements of this _Section 11.04(a)_ of a claim for
indemnification under this _Article XI_ (whether or not formal legal action
shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such claim shall continue to
be subject to indemnification in accordance with this _Article XI_
notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved. 

  

 (b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 11.04(a)_ in respect of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within 20 Business Days after the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, elect to compromise, settle, defend or appeal such Third Party Claim with its own counsel, contractors and consultants (who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and at its own expense and the Indemnified Party shall, and the Parent and the Seller, on the one hand, or the Acquiror, on the other hand (as the case may be), shall cause each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the compromise, settlement or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim; _provided_  that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the compromise, defense, appeal or settlement of such Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (such as reasonable travel costs, but not internal time charges) in providing its cooperation and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to employ one counsel to represent itself if an actual conflict of interest exists in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall promptly be paid by the Indemnifying Party (it being understood that all Indemnified Parties may employ not more than one counsel to represent them at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the compromise, settlement or appeal of, or defense against, such Third Party Claim within 20 Business Days after receipt of notice thereof from the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the compromise, settlement or appeal of, or defense against such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably apprised of any significant developments relating to such Third Party Claim and the compromise, settlement, appeal or 

   ##### 

  

    

defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the compromise,
settlement or appeal of, or defense against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to a
settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim, unless such settlement, compromise, or discharge
or entry or any judgment does not involve any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing or liability by the
Indemnified Party and such settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment
involves only the payment of money damages, and the Indemnifying Party shall
(i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement,
compromise, discharge or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such
settlement, compromise, discharge or judgment (unless otherwise
provided therein) and (ii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement,
compromise, discharge, entry of judgment (if applicable), or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional general release of each Indemnified
Party from any and all liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party, or admit to any liability with
respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article XI_ (including  _Section 11.02_ and _Section 11.03_), no Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this _Article XI_ for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnifying Party, except as permitted under _Section 11.04(b)_ in cases where the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the compromise, settlement, defense or approval of a Third Party Claims 

  

 (d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.04(a)_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days following its receipt of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article XI_. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 11.05. _Payment_  

  

 (a) In the event that the Seller is obligated to make any payment to an Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant to (i) _Section 11.02_ (other than _Sections 11.02(a)(vii)_,  _(viii)_ or _(ix)_ ), (ii) _Article VII_, (iii) _Article VIII_ or (iv) to the indemnification provisions of any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Special Asset Protection Agreement), the Seller may, subject to _Section 2.05_, make any such payment in cash or, at its election, by delivering: (A) shares of Acquiror Stock or Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock; or (B) Equity Units or other Eligible Collateral credited to the Indemnification Collateral Account in accordance with the Indemnification Control Agreement, in each case with an aggregate Fair Value equal to the amount required to be paid. 

   ##### 

  

  

 If any such payment is made in whole or in part from Indemnification Collateral Account Funds, such payment therefrom shall reduce the amount of Indemnification Collateral Account Funds subject to the pledge under the Indemnification Control Agreement by an aggregate Fair Value equal to the amount paid in that manner; provided, that the Seller shall make any such payment using Indemnification Collateral Account Funds promptly after the amount to be paid is established pursuant to the terms hereof or of any Ancillary Agreement, by instructing the Acquiror to debit the Indemnification Collateral Account with respect to Indemnification Collateral Account Funds having a Fair Value equal to the amount to be paid utilizing Indemnification Collateral Account Funds. If the Seller declines or fails to pay the amount owed either directly or by giving instructions as described above, such refusal or failure shall constitute a default hereunder and under the Indemnification Control Agreement and the Acquiror shall be permitted to exercise its rights under the Indemnification Control Agreement and applicable Law as provided in _Section 11.05(b)_ ; _provided_ , that the Acquiror shall not be permitted to withdraw any Pledge Collateral except to the extent it simultaneously withdraws the Equity Units. The exercise of such rights with respect to Eligible Collateral after default under _Section 11.05(b)_ and the Indemnification Control Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the amount of Indemnification Collateral Account Funds consisting of Eligible Collateral by the Fair Value of the Eligible Collateral in respect of which the Acquiror shall exercise such rights, regardless of the amount, if any, actually realized by the Acquiror with respect thereto. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Seller is obligated to make any payment to an Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article II_, _Section 6.12_ or  _Sections 11.02(a)(vii)_, _(viii)_ or _(ix)_ of this Agreement, pursuant to any provisions, other than the indemnification provisions, of any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Special Asset Protection Agreement), or pursuant to the Special Asset Protection Agreement (any such payment being a " _Special Payment_ "), the Seller may, subject to _Section 2.05_, elect to make such Special Payment either in cash or by delivering: (1) shares of Acquiror Stock or Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock; or (2) Equity Units, in each case with an aggregate Fair Value equal to the amount required to be paid; _provided_ that, no such Acquiror Stock, Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock or Equity Units used to make such payments shall consist of Indemnification Collateral Account Funds. In the event that the Seller declines or fails to promptly pay the amount required to be paid in the manner set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Acquiror shall be entitled to demand payment by the Parent in accordance with _Section 6.24(b)_ ; _provided_ that: 

   

 (I) the failure of the Seller to make such Special Payment in accordance with this  _Section 11.05(a)_, and of the Parent to make such Special Payment in accordance with  _Section 6.24(b)_, shall constitute a default hereunder and under the Indemnification Control Agreement and the Acquiror shall be permitted to exercise its rights as a secured party under the Indemnification Control Agreement and applicable Law as provided in  _Section 11.05(b)_; _provided_ , that the Acquiror shall not be permitted to withdraw any Pledge Collateral except to the extent it simultaneously withdraws the associated Equity Units. The exercise of such rights with respect to Eligible Collateral after default under _Section 11.05(b)_ and the Indemnification Control Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the amount of Indemnification Collateral Account Funds consisting of Eligible Collateral by the Fair Value of the Eligible Collateral in respect of which the Acquiror shall have exercised such rights, regardless of the amount, if any, actually realized by the Acquiror with respect thereto; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (II) the provisions of clause (I) above to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Seller or the Parent fails to make any Special Payment while having the financial capability to do so, and such failure is continuing, then the Acquiror may take such action as it may choose to enforce such Special Payment including by bringing an action for breach of contract and damages prior, and without prejudice, to exercising its rights under the Indemnification Control Agreement and applicable Law as provided in _Section 11.05(b)_. With respect to any Special Payment, the exercise by the Acquiror of its rights with respect to Eligible Collateral after default under _Section 11.05(b)_ and the Indemnification Control Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the amount of Indemnification Collateral Account Funds consisting of Eligible Collateral by the Fair Value of the Eligible Collateral in respect of which the Acquiror shall exercise such rights, regardless of the amount, if any, actually realized by the Acquiror with respect thereto. 

  

 (b) At the Closing, the Seller shall assign, transfer, deliver and pledge the Equity Units pursuant to the Indemnification Control Agreement as the "Initial Collateral" thereunder. In the event that an Acquiror Indemnified Party is entitled to any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XI_, _Article VII_, _Article VIII_ or any Ancillary Agreement (other than pursuant to the Special Asset Protection Agreement), the Acquiror, on behalf of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties, shall make a demand to the Seller and/or the Parent as the case may be pursuant to _Section 11.05(a)_ for the payment of such indemnification payment and, if such indemnification payment is not made by the Seller and/or the Parent, as the case may be, to the Acquiror promptly upon the receipt by Seller and/or the Parent, as the case may be, of such demand, the parties agree that such failure to make such indemnification payment shall constitute a default hereunder and under the Indemnification Control Agreement and shall entitle the Acquiror to exercise its rights under the Indemnification Control Agreement, the UCC and otherwise under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Acquiror shall not be permitted to withdraw any Indemnification Collateral except to the extent it simultaneously withdraws the associated Equity Units. To the extent the Indemnification Collateral shall be insufficient to pay in full the indemnification amount, the Acquiror shall be entitled to seek payment of such deficiency from the Seller and/or the Parent, as the case may be, and the Seller and/or the Parent, as the case may be, shall satisfy such payment demand by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as may be designated from time to time by the Acquiror immediately upon receiving such demand or as otherwise permitted by _Section 11.05(a_). For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 11.05(b)_ shall limit or affect in any way the obligations of the Seller and the Parent under _Section 6.24(b)_. 

   

 (c) The Indemnification Collateral will be released from the pledge under the Indemnification Control Agreement, in accordance with the provisions thereof, at the following times and in the following amounts: 

    

 (i) as provided in _Section 11.05(a)_ and _11.05(b)_ ; 

   

 (ii) on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Equity Units with an aggregate stated amount of $1,000,000,000 (or such amount of net cash proceeds from the sale of such number of Equity Units or other Eligible Collateral with an aggregate 

   ##### 

  

    

Fair Value equal to such stated amount substituted therefor in accordance with
the Indemnification Control Agreement) less the Reserved Amount; 

   

 (iii) on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Equity Units with an aggregate stated amount of $1,000,000,000 (or such amount of net cash proceeds from the sale of such number of Equity Units or other Eligible Collateral with an aggregate Fair Value equal to such stated amount substituted therefor in accordance with the Indemnification Control Agreement) less the Reserved Amount; 

   

 (iv) on the date that is 30 months from the Closing Date, the remaining Indemnification Collateral, if any, other than Eligible Collateral with an aggregate Fair Value equal to the Reserved Amount; and 

   

 (v) thereafter, on any reduction in the Reserved Amount other than as a result of any payment with respect thereto made with Indemnification Collateral Account Funds in the amount of such reduction; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) upon the occurrence of a Parent Bankruptcy
or (y) under the circumstances described in _Section 11.05(a)(II)_, in no
event shall any then-remaining Indemnification Collateral be released from
the pledge under the Indemnification Control Agreement pursuant to _Sections
11.05(c)(ii)_ through ( _v_ ); _provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding
(v) the occurrence of a Parent Bankruptcy Event or (w) the existence
of circumstances described in _Section 11.05(a)(II)_, any such remaining
Indemnification Collateral shall be released at the following times and in
the following amounts: 

   

       | (A)  |   | on the date that is 30 months from the
Closing Date, all remaining Indemnification Collateral, other than
Eligible Collateral equal to the lesser of (1) Equity Units with an
aggregate stated amount of $750,000,000 (or such amount of net cash proceeds
from the sale of such number of Equity Units or other Eligible
Collateral with an aggregate Fair Value equal to such stated amount
substituted therefor in accordance with the Indemnification Control
Agreement)  _plus_ the Reserved Amount and (2) the aggregate stated amount
of Equity Units (or the amount of net cash proceeds or the Fair Value
of other Eligible Collateral) then subject to the pledge under
the Indemnification Control Agreement _plus_ the Reserved Amount;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | on the date that is 36 months from the Closing Date,
all remaining Indemnification Collateral, other than Eligible Collateral
equal to the lesser of (1) Equity Units with an aggregate stated amount of
$250,000,000 (or such amount of net cash proceeds from the sale of such
number of Equity Units or other Eligible Collateral with an aggregate Fair
Value equal to such stated amount substituted therefor in accordance with the
Indemnification Control Agreement)  _plus_ the Reserved Amount and (2) the
aggregate stated amount of Equity Units (or the amount of net cash proceeds
or the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | Fair Value of other Eligible Collateral) then subject
to the pledge under the Indemnification Control Agreement _plus_ the
Reserved Amount;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (C)  |   | on the fourth anniversary of the Closing
Date, the remaining Indemnification Collateral, if any, other than
Eligible Collateral with an aggregate Fair Value equal to the Reserved
Amount; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (D)  |   | thereafter, on any reduction in the Reserved Amount
other than as a result of any payment with respect thereto made with
Indemnification Collateral Account Funds in the amount of such reduction.  
   

  

 (d) At any time and from time to time the Seller shall be permitted to substitute Eligible Collateral for the Indemnification Collateral in accordance with the Indemnification Control Agreement. 

   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Fair Value_ " shall mean: (x) with respect to the Equity Units and the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock, unless otherwise determined by the mutual agreement of the Acquiror and the Seller, the fair market value of the Equity Units or the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock as determined by such nationally recognized investment bank as the Acquiror and the Seller shall mutually agree and engage prior to the Closing, or such successor thereto as the Acquiror and the Seller may mutually agree and engage (the " _Valuation Agent_ "); (y) with respect to cash, 100% of the face value thereof; and (z) with respect to a share of the Acquiror Stock, the volume weighted average price of a share of the common stock of the Acquiror, par value $0.01, on the New York Stock Exchange over the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the date of determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the Valuation Agent shall use the methodologies set forth on _Section 11.05(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to determine the fair market value of the Equity Units and the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock. The fees and expenses of the Valuation Agent incurred in connection with such valuation shall be paid by the Seller from funds not subject to the pledge under the Indemnification Control Agreement or if Seller fails to make such payment, by the Parent pursuant to _Section 6.24_; and 

   

 (ii) " _Eligible Collateral_ " shall mean cash, Equity Units, Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock or Acquiror Stock, in each case free and clear of all Liens. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) any dividends declared by the Acquiror on any Acquiror Securities then held in the Indemnification Control Account shall be paid by the Acquiror to the Seller in accordance with the terms of each such security and (ii) in no event shall the Seller be obligated to assign, transfer, deliver or pledge such dividends pursuant to the Indemnification Control Agreement or otherwise.

 Section 11.06. _Exclusive Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, except in cases of fraud and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this _Article XI_ and, with respect to taxes, _Article VIII_, shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedies (including equitable remedies that involve monetary payment, such as restitution or disgorgement, other than specific performance to enforce any payment or performance due hereunder) of the parties in connection with any breach of a representation and warranty, or non-performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any claims based upon fraud be subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Article XI_. 

  

 Section 11.07. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. 

  

 (a) The Seller, the Parent and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each indemnification obligation set forth in _Article XI_ of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other certificate executed or delivered in connection with the Closing: (i) except with respect to amounts required to be paid under the Special Asset Protection Agreement all Losses shall be calculated on an after-tax basis, (ii) all Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds, (iii) in no event shall the Seller have any liability or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XI_ with respect to the inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty made by the Parent or the Seller pursuant to this Agreement to the extent that Losses resulting from or in connection with such inaccuracy or breach have been recovered by the Acquiror in connection with the computation of the Total Closing Date Adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.08_ or the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.09_ (either as a reduction of the amount otherwise payable by the Acquiror to the Seller or as an increase in the amount otherwise payable by the Seller to the Acquiror), (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for any Losses to the extent incurred in connection with the Indemnified Partys successful assertion, enforcement, dispute or resolution of its indemnification or other rights under this Agreement or the collection of any amounts payable to a party hereto under this Agreement, (v) the Indemnified Party shall be liable to the Indemnifying Party for any Losses to the extent incurred in connection with the Indemnifying Partys successful defense of any claim by the Indemnified Party for indemnification or other rights under this Agreement; (vi) except with respect to the matters described in clauses (iii), (v) and (vi) of _Section 11.02(a)_, in no event shall the Seller have any liability or obligation to any Acquiror Indemnified Party to the extent that any Loss, or any portion thereof, for which indemnification is sought hereunder is specifically reflected or reserved for in the Reference Balance Sheet (or if less, the amount specifically reserved for in the Final Closing Balance Sheet) and (vii) notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of this _Article XI_, (A) a breach of a representation or warranty shall be deemed to exist either if such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or would have been inaccurate or breached if such representation or warranty had not contained any qualification as to materiality, or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect (which, in each case, instead will be read as any adverse effect or change) or similar language, and (B) the amount of Losses in respect of any breach of a representation or warranty, including any deemed breach resulting from the application of clause (A), shall be determined without regard to any limitation or qualification as to materiality, or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or 

     ##### 

 

  

Company Material Adverse Effect (which, in each case, instead will be read as
any adverse effect or change) or similar language set forth in such
representation or warranty. 

   

 (b) Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be paid promptly and without reduction, and payment shall not be delayed pending any determination of Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any Eligible Insurance Proceeds or any other amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article XI_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Eligible Insurance Proceeds, but not in excess of the amount actually reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. For purposes of calculating the after-tax basis, the provisions of _Section 8.07(a)(ii)_ through _(v)_ shall apply. 

   

 (c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall treat any indemnification payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing and for the periods set forth in  _Schedule 2.01-2_, subject to Section 6.01, the Acquiror shall provide or cause to be provided to the Parent Entities the services set forth in _Schedule 2.01-2_ (collectively with any Parent Additional Services, the " _Parent Services_ ", and collectively with the Company Services, the " _Scheduled Services_ "). 

   

 Section 2.02. _Access to Facilities_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing and for the periods set forth in  _Schedule 2.02-1_, subject to Section 6.01, the Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Acquiror Entities access to the facilities, equipment and software set forth in  _Schedule 2.02-1_ (collectively with any Company Additional Facilities, the " _Company Facilities_ ").

 Section 2.03. _Additional Services and Access to Additional Facilities_. 

   

 (a) Services or access to facilities, equipment or software not agreed upon in a Schedule attached hereto but provided prior to the Closing by a Parent Entity to an Acquiror Entity, or by an Acquiror Entity to a Parent Entity, can be requested in writing within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the Closing by a Party to this Agreement upon reasonable notice to the other Partys applicable service manager and Contract Manager in accordance with Section 7.03(a). Upon receipt of such notice, within a commercially reasonable period of time under the circumstances, (i) the Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Acquiror Entities such additional services (the " _Company Additional Services_ ") and such access to such additional facilities, equipment and software (the " _Company Additional Facilities_ "), and (ii) the Acquiror shall provide or cause to be provided to the Parent Entities such additional services (the " _Parent Additional Services_ ", and collectively with the Company Additional Services, the " _Additional Services_ ") and such access to such additional facilities, equipment and software (the " _Parent Additional Facilities_ ", and collectively with the Company Additional Facilities, the " _Additional Facilities_ "), in each case on the terms and conditions (other than price) as were applicable to such services or access to such facilities, software and equipment prior to Closing, at the Agreed Price, for a term determined pursuant to Section 6.01 and with any applicable reasonable Set-Up Costs and any termination charges, determined pursuant to Section 6.02, 

      ##### 

   

    

which price, terms and charges shall be (x) proposed in writing by the
applicable Provider within five (5) Business Days of the request from the
applicable Recipient for such Additional Services or Additional Facilities
and (y) agreed by the Parties on or about the time the Provider begins to
provide such Additional Services or access to such Additional Facility; if the
Parties fail to reach agreement on the amount of the Agreed Price, Initial
Additional Service Term, Extended Additional Service Term or any applicable
termination charges or Set-Up Costs, such issues shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 7.09(a), but any such failure to reach agreement
on the foregoing shall not delay the provision of the Additional Service or
access to Additional Facilities. The applicable _Schedule 2.01-1_, _Schedule
2.01-2_, _Schedule 2.02-1_ or _Schedule 2.02-2_ shall be deemed amended to
include the Additional Services and access to Additional Facilities (along
with the Agreed Price, Initial Additional Service Term, Extended Additional
Service Term and termination charges, if any), which shall be provided
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Additional Services shall be deemed to be Scheduled Services hereunder and
the Additional Facilities shall be deemed to be Facilities hereunder. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parent shall have no obligation to provide the services or access to the facilities set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ hereto; _provided_ , that, if the Parent fails to provide such cooperation planning, knowledge transfer and migration under Section 6.13(c)(i) or Section 6.13(c)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement as is reasonably necessary for the Acquiror to provide to the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries a substitute or alternative service or access to facility for a service or facility set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)_, as the case may be, then the Parent shall, as soon as commercially practicable, provide the service or access to facility as an Additional Service or Additional Facility; _provided_ , _further_ , that any dispute as to any such purported failure by the Parent or as to timing of the provision of such service or access to such facility as an Additional Service or Additional Facility shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) hereof on an expedited basis. 

   

 Section 2.04. _Knowledge Transfer_. Each Party will provide, upon the reasonable request of the other Party, (a) the knowledge transfer with respect to the Parent Services, the Company Services, the Parent Facilities and the Company Facilities respectively, (b) knowledge transfer (i) in the case of the Parent, to assist the Acquiror in the migration and integration of the Company Services and use of the Company Facilities and (ii) in the case of the Acquiror, to assist the Parent in the migration and integration of the Parent Services and use of the Parent Facilities, and (c) knowledge transfer to assist the Acquiror in the migration and integration of the Business (collectively, " _Knowledge Transfer Services_ "). Knowledge Transfer Services will be provided for no longer than the thirty (30) days following termination of the particular associated Service or associated Facility for which such Knowledge Transfer Services are being used (or, with respect to any service or access to Facilities performed by the Parent or its Affiliates during the Pre-Closing Period but that will not be performed by the Parent or its Affiliates following the Closing, for thirty (30) days following Closing). Knowledge Transfer Services will be charged to the Party or Affiliate of such Party receiving Knowledge Transfer Services at the Agreed Price plus any related Pass-Through Charges incurred by the Party providing in such Knowledge Transfer Service; _provided_ , that there will be no charge for _de minimis_ Knowledge Transfer Services (which, by way of example, includes meetings (without travel by Provider) or phone calls, in each case of one hour or less in duration). 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 2.05. _Third-Party Vendor Services_. Upon the Acquirors reasonable written request, the Parent shall cooperate or cause its Affiliates to cooperate in the Acquirors negotiation for a direct agreement with any Third-Party Vendor; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Parent nor its Affiliates will be required to amend any contract, pay any amount of consideration or otherwise enter into any accommodation or undertaking with any such Third-Party Vendor in connection with these Third-Party Vendor Services. Third-Party Vendor Services shall be provided for no longer than the duration of the particular associated Service or associated Facility for which such Third-Party Vendor Services are being used. Third-Party Vendor Services will be charged to Acquiror at the Agreed Price plus any related Pass-Through Charges incurred by the Parent and its Affiliates in providing such Third-Party Vendor Services. 

   

 Section 2.06. [Reserved]. 

   

 Section 2.07. _Resumed Services_. If, within sixty (60) days following termination by a Recipient of a Service or access to a Facility in accordance with Section 6.01(c)(i) hereof, such Recipient concludes that such Service or access to a Facility is still needed, the Recipient will so notify the applicable Provider in writing, and such Provider will promptly resume providing such Service or access to a Facility, if commercially reasonable and technologically feasible. The Recipient shall be responsible for the Agreed Price and related Pass Through Charges of Provider associated with resuming such Service or access to a Facility, and to the extent practicable, such Provider shall provide such Recipient with an estimate (with reasonably supportive detail) of such Agreed Price in advance of resuming such Service or access to a Facility. Nothing in this Section 2.07 shall require a Provider to retain any personnel, to maintain any facilities or systems or to take, or refrain from taking, any other action, following a termination by a Recipient of a Service in anticipation of or preparation for the possibility of a Service or Facility being resumed pursuant to this Section 2.07. For the avoidance of doubt, no Service or Facility resumed pursuant to this Section 2.07 will extend the term of such Service or Facility beyond the Scheduled Term of such Service or Facility. 

   

 Section 2.08. _Exception to Obligation to Provide Services or Access to Facilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, no Provider shall be obligated to (and no Party shall be obligated to cause any Provider to) provide any Service or access to any Facility, if the provision of such Service or access to such Facility would (a) violate any applicable Law, (b) violate any agreement, license or promise to customers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation with respect to agreements, licenses and promises shall only apply to any such agreement, license or promise entered into with an unaffiliated third party prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement (each, a " _Pre-Signing Agreement_ "); _provided,_ _further_ , that Provider shall promptly notify Recipient of any such Pre-Signing Agreement and any Service or access to Facility affected thereby; or (c) result in the disclosure of information subject to any applicable privileges (including the attorney-client or similar privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent and the Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (w) subject to Section 6.06(e) and Section 6.13 of the Purchase Agreement, obtain or cause to be obtained Third Party Consents such that the Services or access to the Facilities might be provided without violation of Law or any Pre-Signing Agreements, (x) make any commercially reasonable changes with respect to the Services or access to the Facilities such that they might be provided without violation of Law or any Pre-Signing Agreements or disclosure of information subject to applicable privileges, (y) if no such changes are reasonably 

      ##### 

  

    

possible, provide commercially reasonable alternative sources of such Services
or Facilities and disclose or cause to be disclosed such information or its
substantial equivalent in such a way as to not constitute disclosure of
privileged information; and _provided_ , _further_ , the Provider shall
continue to be obligated to provide the Service or access to Facility to
the extent that doing so would not result in a violation of applicable Law,
or any Pre-Signing Agreements, or disclosure of privileged information. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.08 is intended to relieve a
Party of its obligations, or to modify the obligations, under Section 6.06(e)
or Section 6.13 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 2.14 hereof. 

   

 Section 2.09. _Standard of the Provision of Services or Access to Facilities_. Each Provider shall provide the Services, the access to Facilities and other services and rights hereunder: (a) in accordance with applicable Law and with Providers written policies and procedures, to the extent applicable, (b) at substantially the same standards of performance consistent with such Providers practices for providing such Services or access to Facilities during the Pre-Closing Period, to the extent applicable, (c) in a competent and workmanlike manner and (d) as if Provider were performing such services for itself or its Affiliates. In instances where such Services or access to Facilities were provided in accordance with service level agreements or targets in effect during the Pre-Closing Period, Provider shall promptly provide Recipient with copies of the applicable service level agreements or targets in the event of a written notice by Recipient to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of a purported Service Shortfall or a dispute as to whether a Service or access to a Facility is provided in accordance with this Section 2.09. 

   

 Section 2.10. _Reports_. Each Provider shall provide to its corresponding Recipient the same reports that it provided during the Pre-Closing Period with respect to the Parent Services, the Company Services, the access to the Parent Facilities and the access to Company Facilities in the same form and at the same times as provided during the Pre-Closing Period or otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties (the " _Reports_ "). 

   

 Section 2.11. _Failure to Meet Standards for Services; Inability to Perform,_. 

   

 (a) If a Recipient provides its corresponding Provider with a written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of any purported failure to meet any standard of the Services or access to Facilities required by this Agreement (" _Service Shortfall_ "), as determined by such Recipient in good faith, and if such Provider agrees that a Service Shortfall exists, such Provider shall promptly rectify such failure at its own expense, using commercially reasonable efforts. Any disagreement as to whether a Service Shortfall has occurred or as to any purported Service Shortfall (resulting in timing or quality of performance of any Service falling materially below the standard set forth in Section 2.09) that is not promptly rectified to Recipients reasonable satisfaction shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) hereof on an expedited basis. 

   

 (b) To the extent that any Provider fails to provide, or fails to timely provide, any Service or access to any Facility as required under this Agreement or fails to meet the applicable standards for any Service or access to any Facility as set forth herein, unless such failure resulted primarily from the act or omission of Recipient (even if such failure to provide Service or access to a Facility is excused by Force Majeure pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof), then 

      ##### 

  

    

Recipient and Recipients Affiliates shall have no obligations or liability
hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreement for failure to meet their
obligations hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreement to the extent
such failure by Recipient or its Affiliates is attributable to Providers
failure to provide, to timely provide, or to meet the applicable standards
with respect to such Service or access to a Facility until such time as
Provider cures such failure to the extent required to enable Recipient or its
Affiliates to resume fulfilling such obligations hereunder or under the other
applicable Transaction Agreements. 

   

 Section 2.12. _Change in Services or Access to Facilities_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 2.09, a Provider may, from time to time, reasonably supplement, modify, substitute or otherwise alter (" _Change_ ") the Services and access to the Facilities provided by it in a manner that does not adversely affect in any material respect the quality or availability of such Services or access to such Facilities or increase the cost to Recipient of receiving or using such Services or accessing such Facilities; _provided_ , that to the extent that any such Change is reasonably likely to modify, substitute or otherwise alter the receipt or use of such Services or access to such Facilities, Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of the implementation of the Change to the extent practicable under the circumstances. 

   

 (b) Each Recipient may request in writing any Change to a Service or access to a Facility, which request shall include a description of the proposed Change requested and the associated business specifications (" _Change Request_ "). Provider shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of the Change Request (unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties) to provide Recipient with a written proposal (" _Change Request Proposal_ "), prepared at the Agreed Price at Recipients expense. Provider and Recipient shall then engage in good faith negotiations regarding such Change Request, including with regard to the estimated time and price of implementing the Change Request (including any Third-Party Consents necessary to implement the Change Request) and any potential impact of the Change Request on then-existing Services or access to Facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the estimated price for any Change Request shall be determined using the Agreed Price. If the Parties agree in writing upon a Change Request Proposal or a written variation thereof, the Schedules hereto (if applicable) shall be deemed amended to include the terms and conditions of such agreed-upon Change Request. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change is required by applicable Law or is in response to a New Security Threat, a Provider shall make, at its own initiative or upon the request of a Recipient, any and all changes to the Services or the access to the Facilities necessary to comply with applicable Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such New Security Threat (any such changes to the Services or access to the Facilities, a " _Required Change_ "); _provided_  that (i) such Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of the implementation of any Required Changes, and (ii) any disputes arising in connection therewith shall be rapidly and timely escalated and resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) hereof on an expedited basis. The Recipient shall pay to the Provider the Agreed Price for such Required Change and any related Pass Through Charges incurred by the Provider in making any Required Changes and will pay any incremental Agreed Price and related Pass Through Charges incurred by the 

      ##### 

  

    

Provider in providing the Services or providing access to the Facilities after
implementation of the Required Change. The Recipient will receive the
benefits of any incremental reduction in the Agreed Price enjoyed by the
Provider in providing the Services or providing access to the Facility after
implementation of the Required Change; _provided_ , that with respect to
a change in Law or New Security Threat that is applicable to the businesses
of both Provider and the Recipient, the Parties will share on a _pro rata_
basis in the Agreed Price and related Pass Through Charges incurred by the
Provider in making any Required Change, the incremental Agreed Price
and related Pass Through Charges incurred by the Provider in providing the
Services after implementation of the Required Change and the benefits of any
incremental reduction in the Agreed Price enjoyed by the Provider in
providing the Services after implementation of the Required Change. Each
Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any changes in
applicable Law or New Security Threat that may relate to the provision or
receipt of the Services or access to the Facilities. 

   

 Section 2.13. _Services and Access to Facilities Provided by Other Persons_. The Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, may cause any Person, including any Affiliate of the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, to provide any Service or access to any Facility or any portion thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Person and all Services or access to Facilities provided by such Person shall be subject to confidentiality provisions at least as stringent as those herein and to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including service standards, and that the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall remain responsible for the performance by such Person of all of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Services or access to the Facilities provided by such Person so that such performance is in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of its intention to engage such Person to provide such Services or access to such Facilities, or any portion thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that the engagement of any Person that is not either (i) an Affiliate of either the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, either as of the date hereof or as of the date such engagement occurs, (ii) providing the same or similar Services or access to Facilities to either the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, during the Pre-Closing Period, or (iii) a Person providing Services or access to Facilities after the Closing to a Recipient and concurrently providing similar Services or access to Facilities to either the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall be subject to the other Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall cause any such Person that is an Affiliate of the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, to waive any existing restriction or constraint on its Work Product, any requirement for consent, and any other term of service or performance (and, if applicable, shall not impose such other new terms) that would prevent or impede such Person from providing the Services or the access to Facilities in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.14. _Consents_. Other than with respect to Third Party Consents necessary for providing or receiving the Services or providing access to the Facilities upon Closing (which shall be governed by Section 6.06(e) and Section 6.13 of the Purchase Agreement), each Party shall obtain or cause its Affiliates and Persons providing Services or providing access to Facilities on its behalf to obtain any Third Party Consents necessary for the Services to be provided to and received by the applicable Recipient and for the access to Facilities to be provided to and received by the applicable Recipient and to use any deliverables 

      ##### 

   

    

(including Work Product) provided in connection therewith and shall either (a)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such necessary Third Party
Consent from any Person that is not an Affiliate of such Party or (ii) in the
event such Third Party Consents are not obtained, provide commercially
reasonable alternative arrangements reasonably acceptable to Recipient for
the provision of such Services or access to Facilities consistent with
existing service levels and the standards set forth in Section 2.09. All out-
of-pocket costs of Third Party Consents or providing such acceptable
alternative arrangements with respect to the Scheduled Services, access to
the Scheduled Facilities and Additional Services and access to
Additional Facilities shall be equally split between the Parent and the
Acquiror. The applicable Recipient shall bear the costs of any Third Party
Consents for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services,
Resumed Services, Migration Services and Changes made pursuant to a
Change Request; and the cost of any Third Party Consents for a Required
Change shall be allocated in accordance with the second and third sentences
of Section 2.12(c). 

   

 Section 2.15. [Reserved]. 

   

 Section 2.16. Personnel. 

   

 (a) The Parent or Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause the Provider of any Service or access to any Facility to make available to the Recipient of such Service or access to such Facility such personnel as may be necessary to provide such Service or access to such Facility; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to Section 2.09, the Provider shall have the right, in its reasonable discretion, to (i) designate which personnel it will assign to perform such Service or provide access to such Facility and (ii) remove and replace such personnel at any time, except for such personnel set forth in _Schedule 2.16(a)_   Subject to Section 2.09, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate a Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, to cause any Provider) to hire any additional employees or provide any incentives to employees in addition to those in effect immediately prior to the Closing or to retain the employment of any particular employee or retain the services of any particular consultant, contractor or agent, except as set forth in _Schedule 2.16(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit any Provider from (i) terminating an employee set forth in _Schedule 2.16(a)_ for cause or (ii) refusing to offer or agree to pay an employee set forth in _Schedule 2.16(a)_ increased compensation or other incentives to prevent such employee from leaving the employ of such Provider. In the event that any personnel set forth in  _Schedule 2.16(a)_ is removed or replaced or the employment of such personnel is terminated by Provider, Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice to the applicable service manager or Contract Manager of such removal, replacement or termination. 

   

 (b) The Provider of any Service or access to any Facility shall be solely responsible for all (i) salary, employment and other benefits and liabilities; (ii) payroll, employment, social security, workers compensation, unemployment, disability and similar taxes (including all withholding taxes on such payments or benefits) and (iii) compliance with all employment, immigration and any other applicable Laws, in the case of (i) through (iii) relating to the personnel of such Provider assigned to perform such Service or provide access to such Facility. In performing their respective duties hereunder, all such personnel of a Provider shall be under the direction, control and supervision of such Provider and, subject to Section 2.09 and Section 2.16(a), such Provider shall have the sole right to exercise all authority with respect to 

      ##### 

  

    

the employment (including termination of employment), assignment and
compensation of such personnel. 

   

 Section 2.17. _Cooperation_. Each Party agrees to perform all obligations under this Agreement in good faith and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Services and access to the Facilities. In furtherance of the foregoing: (a) each Party shall timely notify the other in writing as soon as practicable in advance of any circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on the Services or the access to Facilities or security and work with the other Party to minimize the effect of such circumstances; (b) each Party shall timely provide information and documentation reasonably requested by the other Party to be used in the provision or receipt of Services and access to Facilities hereunder; and (c) each Recipient and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate with the applicable Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the provision of any Service and access to any Facility and (ii) enable the applicable Provider and its Affiliates to provide the Services and access to the Facilities in accordance with this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law, no Recipient or its Affiliates shall take any action that would interfere with or materially increase the cost of a Providers providing any of the Services or access to any of the Facilities. 

   

 Section 2.18. _Security; Electronic and Other Access_. 

   

 (a) The Parties shall work together (i) to ensure that each Provider is able to maintain or exceed its current level of security during the term of this Agreement and (ii) to address any New Security Threat, (including compliance with applicable Law (including Privacy Laws) related to such New Security Threat) or the security and protection of Personally Identifiable Information,  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Provider shall not be required to take action in connection with the foregoing (ii) except under a Required Change. 

   

 (b) As of the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Purchase Agreement or in this Agreement or as expressly agreed to in writing by the Parties, (i) the Acquiror Entities shall cease to use and shall have no further access to, and the Parent shall have no obligation to otherwise provide or make available, any business or other services, including any Parent Entitys intranet and other owned, licensed, leased or used computer software, networks, hardware or technology of a Parent Entity, provided or made available to the Acquiror Entities by any Parent Entity prior to the Closing and (ii) the Acquiror Entities shall have no access to, and the Parent Entities shall have no obligation to otherwise provide, any Parent Entitys computer-based resources (including third-Person services, e-mail and access to its computer networks, databases and equipment), whether or not such resources require a password or are available on a secured access basis or on a non-secured access basis. 

   

 (c) To the extent that the performance or receipt of Services or access to Facilities hereunder requires any Party or Provider to have access to the other Partys or its Affiliates Systems (including third Person services, e-mail and access to computer networks, database and equipment) owned, licensed, leased or used by such other Party or its Affiliates (" _Required Technology_ "), such other Party or its Affiliates shall provide limited access to such Required Technology in accordance with applicable Law (including Privacy Laws) and subject to the security, use, Virus protection, disaster recovery and confidentiality policies and 

      ##### 

  

    

procedures (including physical security, network access, Internet security,
confidentiality and Processing of Personally Identifiable Information and
security guidelines and procedures) of such Provider, as they may be amended
from time to time, provided that such policies were in effect at the time of
such access and are made known to the other Partys personnel who are seeking
such access prior to such access (the " _Security Regulations_ "). The Parent
and the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause the Parent
Entities and the Acquiror Entities, as the case may be, and all of their
respective personnel having access to the Required Technology to (i) comply
with all of such Partys or its Affiliates Security Regulations that are
applicable to the provision of any Service or access to any Facility; (ii)
not tamper with, compromise or circumvent any security or audit measures
employed by such Party or its Affiliate whose Required Technology is being
accessed; (iii) execute a separate system access agreement, upon commercially
reasonable terms, with such Party or its Affiliate, (iv) ensure that only
those users who are specifically authorized by such Party or its Affiliates,
as the case may be, gain access to the Required Technology; and (v) use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized
destruction, alteration or loss of information contained therein by such
users. The rights of access to the Required Technology granted hereunder
shall be restricted to user access only, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the Parties, and shall not include privileged or higher level
access rights or rights to functionality. Other than as specifically
permitted under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, no Person
shall have any rights of access to the other Partys Required Technology or
Systems. 

   

 (d) While Services are being provided hereunder, each Party shall take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that, in connection with the provision or receipt of any Services or access to any Facilities, no Virus or similar items are coded or introduced into either its own (including its Affiliates) or the other Partys (including its Affiliates) Systems. If, in connection with the provision of any Services or access to any Facilities, a Virus is found to have been introduced into such Systems, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and to diligently work together with the other Party, each at its own cost, to eliminate the effects of such Virus. 

   

 (e) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Providers and Recipients to, exercise commercially reasonable care or such higher standard that may be required by applicable Privacy Laws to prevent unauthorized Persons from accessing the Services, Facilities, Personally Identifiable Information, Required Technology or other Systems of the other Party and its Affiliates, including (i) promptly terminating the rights of any user under its control that has sought to circumvent or has circumvented the applicable Security Regulations, (ii) immediately notifying (verbally and then in writing) the other Party if it learns that an unauthorized Person has accessed or may access any Required Technology or other Systems of such other Party or that a Person has engaged in activities that may lead to the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration or loss of Personally Identifiable Information, or other data, information or software whether on such other Partys Required Technology or other Systems, and (iii) immediately implementing the notification procedures and actions required by Section 7.02. 

   

 (f) Each Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and other Providers to cooperate, fully and in a timely way with any investigation relating to the security of Personally Identifiable Information, the Facilities, the Required Technology or other Systems 

      ##### 

  

    

that arises in connection with this Agreement, including providing any
relevant information or material in its possession or under its control that
is reasonably requested by the other Party.

 (e) If a Provider hereunder that is not an Affiliate of either the Parent or the Acquiror entered into agreements with the Parent, the Acquiror or their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing, which agreements allocate title in work product to such Provider or another third party, then the Parent or the Acquiror, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for the applicable Recipient at the Recipients expense, (i) in the case of Work Product to be owned by such Recipient, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable license for Recipient to copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute, display, perform and otherwise use such work product in such Recipients business and that of such Recipients Affiliates and (ii) in the case of Work Product to be owned by Provider, a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the work product in accordance with Section 2.20(a).

In the event the Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Provider) fails to invoice Sales Taxes on taxable goods or services covered by this Agreement in a timely manner, the Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Provider) shall notify the Recipient (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Recipient) in a timely manner and the Recipient (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Recipient) shall remit an amount equal to such Sales Taxes (where relevant following the provision of a valid VAT invoice) to the Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Provider); _provided_ , however, that the Recipient shall not be responsible for the payment of any 

      ##### 

  

    

additions to such Sales Taxes, including penalties and interest imposed due to
a failure by the Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be,
on behalf of the Provider) to account for such Sales Taxes or cause them to
be accounted for in a timely manner to the appropriate taxing authority
except where such failure was due to the Recipients breach of any obligation
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, except where determined or as required
by applicable Law, the Person responsible for remitting the Sales Tax to the
Tax Administration shall be determined in accordance with past practice as
between such Recipient and Provider. Notwithstanding any other proviso, the
Recipient shall not be required in any case to indemnify the Provider for any
(x) penalties, interest or additions to tax imposed with respect to a Sales
Tax to the extent such amounts are imposed due to a failure by the Provider
(or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the
Provider) to collect, remit or account for any such taxes to a taxing
authority timely or timely file any tax return relating to such taxes
except where such failure was directly due to the Recipients breach of any
obligation herein or (y) taxes other than Sales Taxes and, to the extent that
any tax other than a Sales Tax is required to be withheld or deducted by the
Recipient, the Recipient (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be,
on behalf of the Recipient) has the right to withhold or deduct the amount of
such tax from any consideration under this Agreement and such amount shall be
treated as paid for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the amount required to be remitted by or with respect to Sales Tax
shall be reduced by the amount of any such Sales Tax that is
recoverable, refundable or creditable to the Provider (or the Parent or the
Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the Provider) or for which the
Provider (or the Parent or the Acquiror, as the case may be, on behalf of the
Provider) is reimbursed or held harmless against by another party (other
than an indemnity set forth under this Agreement). For the avoidance of
doubt, the amount required to be remitted by the Recipient (or the Parent or
the Acquiror, as the case may be on behalf of the Recipient) with respect to
VAT for purposes of this Agreement shall not be reduced by reference to any
amounts accounted for by or on behalf of the Provider or an Affiliate of the
Provider and which are recoverable, refundable or creditable to the Provider
or an Affiliate of the Provider as input VAT. 

   

 Section 3.02. _No Right to Set-Off; Disputed Invoice Amounts_. Each applicable Party shall pay or cause the applicable Recipient that is its Affiliate to pay to the other Party or the applicable Provider the full amount of undisputed Service Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges, other amounts required to be paid on behalf of each Recipient under this Agreement and except as permitted by this Section 3.02 or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any amount owed or claimed to be owed under this Agreement on account of any obligation owed by or on behalf of a Provider, whether or not such obligation has been finally adjudicated, settled or otherwise agreed upon in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Party or its applicable Recipient disputes any specific amount on an invoice, such Party shall notify the other Party and the applicable Provider in writing and describe in detail the reason for disputing such specific amount and shall have no obligation to pay such amount during the pendency of the dispute with respect to such amount. The Parties shall use, and shall cause the respective Recipient and Provider to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with respect to such specific disputed amount. If the respective Recipient and Provider or the employees or their designees at the Parent and the Acquiror responsible for preparing and reviewing the invoices are unable to reach an agreement about any such specific disputed amounts within ten (10) Business Days after such 

      ##### 

  

    

written notification has been received, the matter shall be rapidly and timely
escalated and resolved in accordance with Section 7.09(a)(i) hereof on an
expedited basis. Upon resolution of the dispute, the Party shall promptly
pay, or cause its Affiliate that is the applicable Recipient to promptly pay,
the applicable amount, if any, as determined by the process used in

 (c) With respect to any Service or access to any Facility: 

    

 (i) a Recipient may terminate Service or access to such Facility, in whole, or in part (in accordance with Section 6.01(d)), with respect to such Service or access to such Facility: (A) for any reason or no reason upon providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the applicable service manager and the Contract Manager of the Provider of such Service or access to such Facility (unless a longer notice period is specified in the Schedules attached hereto), in each case, subject to the obligation to pay any applicable termination charges pursuant to Section 6.02; or (B) upon mutual agreement of the Parties; 

   

 (ii) a Provider may terminate such Service or access to such Facility, in whole but not in part with respect to such Service or access to such Facility: within ten (10) days after receipt by the Recipient of such Service or access to such Facility of written notice to the applicable service manager and the Contract Manager, if the continued performance of such Service or the provision of access to such Facility would be a violation of any Law;  _provided_ , that, during the ten (10) days following such notification, the Contract Managers shall discuss in good faith how to provide such Service or access to such Facility or an equivalent service or equivalent access to a facility, equipment or software without a violation of Law pursuant to Section 2.12(c). 

 

If a Service or access to a Facility is terminated, the relevant Schedule, if
applicable, shall be updated to reflect such termination. In the event that
the effective date of the termination of any Service or access to any
Facility is a day other than at the end of a month, the Service Charge,
charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services,
Additional Services, Resumed Services and Migration Services, the Pass-
Through Charges and other amounts due to a Provider associated with such
Service or access to such Facility shall be pro-rated appropriately. Within
ten (10) Business Days following receipt of a notice of termination in
accordance with Section 6.01(c)(i), Provider shall send to the applicable
service manager and the Contract Manager for Recipient a written notice that
either (X) states that the Service or access to Facilities for which
termination is requested has no dependencies and can be terminated on the
requested date or (Y) to the extent that a Providers ability to provide a
Service or access to a Facility, as the case may be, is dependent on the
continuation of another Service or access to another Facility that the
Recipient seeks to terminate, describes any such dependency to such Recipient,
in which case the Service or access to a Facility sought to be terminated
shall not 

      ##### 

  

    

terminate and the Parties shall work in good faith to determine how and when
such Service or access to such Facility can be terminated. 

   

 (d) Each Recipient may from time to time request a reduction in part of the scope or amount of any Service or access to any Facility or the partial termination thereof by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager for the Provider of such Service in access to such Facility, in which case the Parties shall cause the applicable Provider and Recipient to discuss the feasibility of such a reduction or partial termination in good faith and the appropriate reductions in scope or amount to the relevant Service Charges or other applicable charges in light of all relevant factors, including the costs and benefits to the Provider of any such reductions. If the Recipient and the applicable Provider agree on the terms of such reduction or partial termination, which terms shall be in writing and approved by the Contract Managers, then the relevant Schedule, if applicable, shall be updated to reflect any such reduced Service or access to such Facility and the Provider shall provide the reduced or partially terminated Service or access to Facility in accordance with the agreed to terms. 

   

 Section 6.02. _Termination Charges_. Upon early termination of any Scheduled Service or scheduled access to any Facility pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i), the Recipient shall reimburse the Provider the amount of fifty percent (50%) of such termination charges as are set forth in the applicable _Schedule 2.01-1_, _Schedule 2.01-2_, _Schedule 2.02-1_ or  _Schedule 2.02-2_. Upon the early termination of any Additional Service or Additional Facility pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i), the Recipient shall reimburse the Provider the amount of fifty percent (50%) of all "kill" fees and other similar fees actually paid by the Provider or any of its Affiliates to unaffiliated third parties that were engaged solely in order to provide such Additional Service or Additional Facility, which fees were incurred in connection with the early termination of the Additional Service or Additional Facility and to the extent such "kill" fees and similar fees would not have been incurred had Recipient continued to receive the applicable Additional Service or Additional Facility for the originally contemplated Additional Service Term thereof, as the case may be. Each Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the existence and amount of such early termination charges, "kill" fees and similar fees. All termination charges, "kill" fees and similar fees due and payable under this Section 6.02 shall be due and payable to the Provider in accordance with Article III.. 

   

 Section 6.03. _Effect of Termination_. 

   

 (a) Upon termination of any Service or access to any Facility in accordance with this Agreement and subject to Section 6.02, the Provider of such terminated Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility will have no further obligation to provide such terminated Service or such terminated access to the applicable Facility, and the Recipient of such terminated Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility shall have no obligation to pay any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges and other amounts relating to any such terminated Service or such terminated access to the applicable Facility;  _provided_ , that the Recipient of such terminated Services or such terminated access to the applicable Facility shall remain obligated to the Provider for any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services, 

      ##### 

  

    

Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges and other
amounts owed and payable in respect of such terminated Service or such
terminated access to the applicable Facility that was provided prior to the
effective date of termination. Any and all rights to Intellectual Property
granted to a Recipient and/or Provider hereunder in connection with the
provision of a terminated Service or terminated access to the applicable
Facility shall immediately cease upon such termination, except to the extent
such Intellectual Property is needed for such Recipient to fulfill its
obligations under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements. In connection with the termination of any
Service or access to any Facility, the provisions of this Agreement not
relating solely to such terminated Service or such terminated access to the
applicable Facility shall survive any such termination. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable upon termination of this Agreement, or, if applicable, upon earlier termination of any particular Service or access to a Facility (i) each Party will deliver, or will cause to be delivered to the other Party, all materials and property in its possession or control (or the possession or control of an Affiliate) which is owned by or licensed to such other Party or its Affiliates (including any Work Product owned by such Party or its Affiliates in whatever state of completion as well as any data and Confidential Information owned, licensed or leased by such Party), and (ii) the Parties shall make a good faith effort to delete from their Systems (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Providers that are not Affiliates to delete from their Systems) all Work Product, data and Confidential Information owned, licensed or leased by the other Party or its Affiliates that are no longer needed for the Party to fulfill its obligations under, or obtain the benefits under, this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require either Party to delete any Confidential Information data or Work Product from any back-up or disaster recovery media;  _provided_ , that such Work Product data and Confidential Information is not accessed or used for any purpose other than restoration of information and data of such Party commingled with such Work Product and Confidential Information; _provided_ , _further_ , that such back-up or disaster recovery media is securely disposed of or recycled in accordance with the Partys policies and practices, which in all cases shall be commercially reasonable and meet industry standards. 

   

 (c) In the event that Provider or its Affiliates have purchased any resources in the name of or on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates and has fully charged such purchase as a Pass-Through Charge or if Provider has licensed any resources solely in connection with the provision of Services or access to Facilities for Recipient or its Affiliates and fully charged such license as a Pass-Through Charge (each, an " _Acquired Resource_ "), then upon payment of such Pass-Through Charge, Provider shall: (i) transfer to Recipient all right, title and interest that Provider holds in such Acquired Resource and (ii) deliver such Acquired Resource to such Recipient at no additional charge, except for any charges incurred by Provider in transferring the Acquired Resource, which shall be paid by the Recipient, upon the termination of the last Service or termination of access to the last Facility hereunder for which such Acquired Resource is necessary;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for any Acquired Resource that is a license for Intellectual Property, the Provider shall be obligated to transfer and deliver such Acquired Resource to the Recipient only if it has licensed such Acquired Resource in the name of or on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates. Provider agrees to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to license any such Acquired Resource in the name of or on behalf of Recipient or its Affiliates and, in the event it is unable to do so or reasonably believes it will not be able to do so, it shall so notify the 

      ##### 

   

    

Recipient in writing prior to acquiring or attempting to acquire such license
and the Provider and the Recipient shall discuss in good faith commercially
reasonable alternatives that could be licensed in the name of or on behalf of
the Recipient; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Provider and the
Recipient do not agree to a commercially reasonable alternative within
fifteen days of commencement of such good faith discussions, the Recipient
shall provide written notice to the Provider that either (X) states that
Provider may license such Acquired Resource in the name of Provider or (Y)
provides notice, under Section 6.01(c)(i), of termination of the Service for
which the Intellectual Property is required. The Provider shall not be liable
for any delay in the provision of a Service or access to Facility that occurs
during the fifteen day discussion period between the Parties solely to the
extent that such delay is caused by the inability to obtain the Acquired
Resource in the name of Recipient. Each Party shall from time to time, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, execute any documents and take any other
actions reasonably requested by the other Party to effectuate the intent of
this Section 6.03(c), and the Recipient shall reimburse such Provider or its
Affiliates their Agreed Price related to such actions. 

   

  (d) In connection with the termination of this Agreement, Article
I, Article V, Article VII, Section 2.20, Section 6.02, this Section 6.03 and
Section 6.04, and liability for all due and unpaid Service Charges, charges
for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional
Services, Resumed Services and Migration Services, Pass-Through Charges
and other amounts required by this Agreement shall continue to survive
indefinitely. 

   

 Section 6.04. _Force Majeure_. 

   

 (a) No Party (or any Person acting on its behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for any interruption, delay or other failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this Agreement so long as and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented, frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of a Force Majeure, _provided_ that such Party (or such Person) shall have exercised commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of a Force Majeure on its obligations, including, if applicable, implementing its disaster recovery and/or business continuity plans. In the event of an occurrence of a Force Majeure, the Party whose performance is affected thereby shall give notice (orally or in writing) to the applicable service manager and Contract Manager of suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the other stating the date and extent of such suspension and the cause thereof, and such non-performing Party shall resume the performance of such obligations as soon as reasonably practicable upon the cessation of such Force Majeure and its effects. 

   

 (b) During the period of a Force Majeure affecting the Provider, the Recipient shall be entitled to seek an alternative service provider with respect to the Services affected or access to the Facilities affected and the Provider and the Recipient will split equally the incremental cost increase for any such alternative service provider. If a Force Majeure shall continue to exist for more than fifteen (15) consecutive days, the Recipient shall be entitled to permanently terminate the Services affected or access to the Facilities affected with no termination charges due pursuant to Section 6.02 or otherwise in connection with such termination. The Recipient shall be relieved of the obligation to pay any Service Charges, charges for Knowledge Transfer Services, Third-Party Vendor Services, Additional Services and Resumed Services, Migration Services Charges, Pass-Through Charges and other amounts for 

      ##### 

  

    

the provision of the affected Services or access to the affected Facilities
throughout the duration of such Force Majeure.

 Section 7.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

   

 Section 7.05. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between or on behalf of the Parent and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that either Party may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates so long as such assignment does not release such Party from any liability under this Agreement incurred prior to such assignment. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 7.06 shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 7.07. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Article V with respect to Indemnified Persons, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person (including any Client Company or any policyholder of the Company or any of the Insurance Subsidiaries) any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Any Provider who is an Affiliate or, immediately prior to the Closing, was an Affiliate of either Party, shall be an express third party beneficiary under this Agreement solely with respect to such Providers rights and, as such, such Provider may instruct the Parent, and the Parent shall, enforce this Agreement on Providers behalf as if such Provider were a party hereto. 

   

 Section 7.08. _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by all the Parties. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

   

 Section 7.09. _Dispute Resolution_. 

   

 (a) Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising from, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all claims and defenses arising out of or relating to any such transaction or this Agreement or the formation, breach, termination, or validity thereof (a " _Dispute_ ") shall be resolved as follows: the service managers of the Parties most immediately responsible for the issue giving rise to the Dispute shall seek to resolve such Dispute through informal good faith negotiation. If the Dispute is not resolved at that level of management, then the Dispute shall be escalated to the Parent Contract Manager and the Acquiror Contract Manager for resolution in good faith. In the event such Contract Managers fail to meet or, if they meet, fail to resolve the Dispute within an additional ten (10) Business Days (or such longer time as the Contract Managers may agree), then the claiming Party will provide the other Party with a written " _Notice of Dispute_ ", describing the nature of the Dispute, and the Dispute shall be escalated to the members of senior management at the Acquiror and the Parent set forth in _Schedule 7.09(a)_ for resolution in good faith. In the event such senior executives fail to meet, or if they meet, fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5) Business Days after such Dispute has been escalated to them by the Contract Managers, then the Dispute shall be escalated to the senior administrative executives at the Acquiror and the Parent set forth in  _Schedule 7.09(a)_ , or their respective designees who shall meet within five (5) Business Days and confer in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute. If the senior administrative executives, or their respective designees fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5) Business Days, the Parties shall retain all rights under applicable Law and this Agreement with respect to such Dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.09(b), the procedures set forth in this Section 7.09(a) must be satisfied as a condition precedent to a Party commencing any legal proceeding, and a Partys failure to comply with such procedures shall constitute cause for the dismissal without prejudice of any such legal proceeding. 

       ##### 

  

      

 (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Dispute arising under Section 2.03(b), Section 2.11(a), Section 2.12(c), Section 2.18(g), Section 2.24, Section 3.02, Section 6.01(a) or Section 7.02(d), or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the Dispute shall be immediately referred to the Contract Managers, who shall have five (5) Business Days to resolve the Dispute (or such shorter time if the Contract Managers agree that they cannot resolve the Dispute) before escalation to the senior executives along with the applicable Notice of Dispute. Thereafter, the procedures and time frames set out beginning in the fourth sentence of Section 7.09(a) shall apply. 

   

 (ii) Each Party may replace the designated member of senior management or executive level administrative officer with an employee or officer with comparable knowledge, expertise and decision-making authority from time to time upon written notice to the other Party pursuant to Section 7.03(b). The applicable Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions herein to the contrary, each Party hereby acknowledges that money damages may be an inadequate remedy for a breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered in the event that this Agreement is breached. Therefore, in the event of a breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement by the other Party or its Affiliates, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Party may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, seek an injunction, on written notice to the other Party in accordance with this Section 7.03(b) in a court described in Section 7.10(b) to prohibit such breach or anticipated breach. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that an injunction is a proper, but not exclusive, remedy available to each Party and that the harm from any breach or anticipated breach of the covenants set forth in this Agreement would be irreparable and immediate. 

   

 Section 7.10. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

   

 (a) This Agreement, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all claims and defenses arising out of or relating to any such transaction or this Agreement or the formation, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect any conflicts of Law principles of such state that would apply the Laws of another jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) Each of the Parent and the Acquiror irrevocably and unconditionally: 

    

 (i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the county of New York in any Action directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the formation, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined solely in such court; 

   ##### 

   

   

 (ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in such court or that such court is an inconvenient forum for the Action and agrees not to assert, plead or claim the same; 

   

 (iii) agrees that the final judgment of such court shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction over the relevant party or any of its assets; 

   

 (iv) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section 7.03(b); and 

   

 (v) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the applicable rules of procedure. 

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FORMATION, BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 7.10. EITHER PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b) references to the terms Preamble, Recital, Article, Section, paragraph and Schedule are references to the Preamble, Recitals, Articles, Sections, paragraphs and Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise specified; (c) references to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars; (d) the word "including" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including without limitation," unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "or" shall not be exclusive; (f) the words "herein," "hereof", "hereunder" or "hereby" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section; (g) the headings

B) Assumptions 

   

       | 1.  |   | Specific Assumptions:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | a.  |   | Pending TSA length, the Acquirors decision will
affect the number of SSL certificates for secure web sites renewed as
necessary. ALICO HO will be provided a list of all SSL Certificates with
expiration dates to determine which would require renewal within the TSA
period.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Currently there are 69 ALICO HO Neoteris users. Services
and costs associated with this are not included in Schedule. Users will be
migrated off the solution as it is not being offered as a service.  
      
    | c.  |   | Radius user provisioning is only supported in
conjunction with users migrating to the ATT Legacy VPN solution (from both
Neoteris and ATT VPN). The ATT Legacy VPN solution allows for limited access
versus unrestricted access.

B) Assumptions 

   

       | 1.  |   | Specific Assumptions:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | a.  |   | Pending TSA length, Acquirors decision will
affect the number of SSL certificates for secure web sites renewed as
necessary. ALICO HO will be provided a list of all SSL Certificates with
expiration dates to determine which would require renewal within the TSA
period.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Currently there are 29 ALICO HO Neoteris users. Services
and costs associated with this are not included in Schedule. Users will be
migrated off the solution as it is not being offered as a service.  
      
    | c.  |   | Radius user provisioning is only supported in
conjunction with users migrating to the ATT Legacy VPN solution (from both
Neoteris and ATT VPN). The ATT Legacy VPN solution allows for limited access
versus unrestricted access.

 Registration and Offering 

   

 Section 2.1 _Registration Demands._  

   

 (a) Subject to this Section 2.1 and Section 2.8, if at any time the Company shall receive a Registration Demand, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly file a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the resale pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act from time to time by the Investor of all of the Subject Securities requested by the Investor to be registered thereby in one or more Offerings (including the Prospectus, amendments and supplements to the shelf registration statement or Prospectus, including pre- and post-effective amendments, all exhibits thereto and all material incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference, if any, in such shelf registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The plan of distribution in the Shelf Registration Statement shall be approved by the Investor and the Company and shall permit only Offerings. 

   

 (b) Subject to this Section 2.1 and Sections 2.2 and 2.8, if at any time the Company shall receive a Registration Demand and the Company is not eligible to use a Shelf Registration Statement at the time such Registration Demand is received by the Company, then the Company shall effect, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the registration under the Securities Act of all Subject Securities that the Investor requests to be registered pursuant to a Registration Statement (including the Prospectus, amendments and supplements to such registration statement or Prospectus, including pre- and post-effective amendments, all exhibits thereto and all material 

      ##### 

  

    

incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference, if any,
in such registration statement, a "Demand Registration Statement") separate
from the Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with each such Demand
Registration Statement, the Company shall cause there to occur Agreed
Cooperation. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Demand Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
Commission as promptly as practicable following such filing (and concurrently
with such filing if the Company is a WKSI). The plan of distribution in the
Demand Registration Statement shall be approved by the Investor and the
Company and shall permit only Offerings. 

   

 (c) The Company shall not be required to effect or maintain the effectiveness of a registration pursuant to a Registration Demand or otherwise: (i) until on or after the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date; (ii) more than once in any 120-day period or more than three times in any 365-day period; (iii) at any time that a Shelf Registration Statement for the benefit of the Investor is then effective to cover all of the Subject Securities held by the Investor; (iv) at any time following the later of (y) the first anniversary of the Third Stock Purchase Date and (z) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and (v) during any of the periods specified in Section 2.5. No Subject Securities may be registered, offered, sold or otherwise transferred under, and the Company shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of, more than one registration statement at any one time. A Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 2.12 shall not be considered a Registration Demand for purposes of this Section 2.1(c). 

   

 Section 2.2 _Offerings._  

   

 (a) Subject to this Section 2.2 and Section 2.8, the Investor may make an Offering pursuant to a Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Offering shall be made unless the reasonably anticipated aggregate gross proceeds of such Offering are at least $500 million. To make an Offering the Investor shall deliver an Offering Notice to the Company at least five Business Days prior to the launch of a proposed Offering. 

   

 (b) In connection with any Offering: (i) unless the Company and the Investor otherwise agree in writing, the Company and the Investor shall each have the right to appoint two of four active Book-Runners; _provided_ that each Book-Runner appointed pursuant hereto shall have equally shared responsibilities and economics, including for investor meetings and allocating the order book with all other Book-Runners; and (ii) if requested by the Company or the Investor, the Investor and the Company shall cause all of the Book-Runners to provide a Book-Runners Notice to the Company and the Investor at least two Business Days prior to the launch of such proposed Offering. In the event that the Book-Runners Notice states that an Initial Amount or maximum realizable amount, as the case may be, is anticipated to be less than $500 million, the Company may, at its option, terminate or suspend the Offering. 

   

 (c) After the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.5, the Investor shall be permitted to request up to three Offerings in each 365-day period commencing on the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date or any anniversary of the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date; _provided_ that: 

   

       | (i)  |   | the Investor shall have provided the Company with
the Offering Notice described in Section 2.2(a);  
---|---|---|--- 
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (ii)  |   | in the case of each subsequent Offering
following the initial Offering, the launch date for such subsequent Offering
shall be at least 120 days after the launch date of the preceding Offering;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iii)  |   | without the Companys prior written consent, the
Investor shall not offer or sell in any Offering (including, if applicable,
pursuant to the exercise of an Over-Allotment Option ), any Subject
Securities that, without giving effect to the Offering, would represent more
than 15% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company at the time of such
Offering. In determining whether the amount of Subject Securities proposed to
be included in such Offering would exceed such limitation, for this purpose
only, the amount of Subject Securities which (y) constitute Transferable
Preferred Stock shall be calculated on the basis that each share of
Transferable Preferred Stock is the equivalent of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such share of Transferable Preferred Stock would be
convertible if the approval of the stockholders of the Company required for
such conversion had been obtained, and (z) constitute Common Equity Units
shall be calculated by dividing the aggregate Stated Amount of the Common
Equity Units that the Investor proposes to include in the Offering by the
Threshold Appreciation Price;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | without the Companys prior written consent, the
Investor shall not offer or sell in any Offering, including pursuant to the
exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, Subject Securities if the aggregate
gross proceeds thereof would exceed $4 billion;  
      
    | (v)  |   | without the Companys prior written consent, the
Investor shall not offer or sell in any Offering, including pursuant to the
exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, or otherwise Transfer in accordance
with Section 2.8, in any 180-day period, Subject Securities if the aggregate
gross proceeds thereof would exceed $6.6 billion; and  
      
    | (vi)  |   | the Investor shall not include any of the Stock
Purchase Contracts in an Offering, other than as a constituent part of the
related Common Equity Units.  
   

  

 (d) In the event that the Investor is proposing an Offering in order to sell all of its remaining Subject Securities (assuming the exercise in full of the Over-Allotment Option), the $500 million minimum Offering limit set forth in Section 2.2(a) shall not apply. 

   

 (e) Subject also to the other limitations and conditions in Section 2.8, following an Offering of: 

   

       | (i)  |   | Investor Common Stock or Transferable Preferred
Stock, the Investor and the Permitted Transferees shall not Transfer any
Investor Common Stock, Transferable Preferred Stock or Common Equity Units;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | Common Equity Units, the Investor and the Permitted
Transferees shall not Transfer any Investor Common Stock, Transferable
Preferred Stock, Common Equity Units, Unit Preferred Stock or Debt
Securities;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

      

  

       | (iii)  |   | Unit Preferred Stock, the Investor and the
Permitted Transferees shall not Transfer any Unit Preferred Stock; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iv)  |   | Debt Securities, the Investor and the Permitted
Transferees shall not Transfer any Debt Securities;  
   

 

in each case, in the 60 days following the settlement date of each such
Offering, except for Transfers to Permitted Transferees and the Company 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Offering shall be on a continuous basis. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Expenses_. Except as specifically provided in this Section 2.3, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance with law with respect to a Registration Statement or an Offering hereunder shall be borne by the Company. All Selling Expenses incurred in connection with any registrations or Offerings hereunder shall be borne by the Investor. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for the expenses of any registration proceeding pursuant to Section 2.1 or any Offering pursuant to Section 2.2 if the related Registration Demand or Offering Notice has been withdrawn by the Investor unless (i) the withdrawal is based upon any information concerning the Company that the Company (A) in its reasonable judgment has determined is material and adverse and (B) had not publicly revealed at least 48 hours prior to the related Registration Demand or Offering Notice or that the Company had not otherwise notified the Investor of at the time of such related Registration Demand or Offering Notice or (ii) the Investor agrees to forfeit its right to one Registration Demand pursuant to Section 2.1 or one Offering pursuant to Section 2.2, as applicable. If the Company is required to pay the Registration Expenses of a withdrawn Registration Demand or Offering pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.3, then the Investor shall not forfeit its rights pursuant to Section 2.1 or Section 2.2, as applicable. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever required by this Agreement to effect a Registration Demand or assist with an Offering, the Company shall, as applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the sale of the Subject Securities in accordance with the intended methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable: 

   

 (a) (i) Prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement with respect to such Subject Securities being registered and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective upon filing, but, in any event not later than 30 days after receipt of such Registration Demand, or (ii) prepare and file with the Commission a prospectus supplement with respect to such Subject Securities pursuant to an effective Registration Statement and keep such Registration Statement effective until at least the earliest of: (w) the settlement of the Offering; (x) the receipt of a new Registration Demand from the Investor if permitted under Section 2.1; (y) the disposition of all Subject Securities registered thereunder; or (z) following the later of (A) the first anniversary of the Third Stock Purchase Date and (B) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including any prospectus supplement for a shelf takedown), furnish to the Investor and the Book-Runners a reasonable number of copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, not including documents incorporated by 

      ##### 

  

    

reference in the Prospectus and the exhibits incorporated by reference, and
the Investor and the Book-Runners shall have the opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and the Company will make such changes and additions thereto
as reasonably requested by the Investor or the Book-Runners prior to filing
any Registration Statement or amendment thereto or any Prospectus or any
supplement thereto. 

   

 (b) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to the applicable Registration Statement and the prospectus or prospectus supplement used in connection with such Registration Statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Subject Securities covered by such Registration Statement or offered or sold in such Offering, as applicable, for the relevant period set forth in Section 2.4(a) and, in the case of the Shelf Registration Statement, prepare such prospectus supplements containing such disclosures as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the applicable Offering, which disclosures shall include any disclosures with respect to the Investor or the plan of distribution as may be reasonably requested by the Investor or the Book-Runners in connection with such Offering.

 (e) Enter customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Book-Runners of any Offering) and take such other actions (including participating in and making documents available for the due diligence review of the Book-Runners) as are reasonably required in order to facilitate the disposition of such Subject Securities. The Investor participating in an Offering or a primary underwritten offering of Common Stock by the Company in accordance with Section 2.12, as applicable, shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such underwriting agreement; _provided_ , that the Investor shall in no event be obligated to provide any representations or warranties under such underwriting agreement, except with respect to information relating to the Investor or the plan of distribution included in or omitted from the Prospectus for such Offering in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Investor expressly for use therein and other representations and warranties as would be customarily requested of a selling stockholder.

 (i) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, on the date that such Subject Securities are delivered to the Book-Runners for sale, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of legal counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given by legal counsel to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Book-Runners, and (ii) a letter dated as of such date, from the independent registered public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent registered public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Book-Runners. 

   

 (j) Give written notice to the Investor: 

   

       | (i)  |   | when any Registration Statement, the Prospectus
or any prospectus supplement, or any amendment thereto has been filed with
the Commission and when such Registration Statement or any post-effective

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (v)  |   | the happening of any event that requires the
Company to make changes in any effective Registration Statement or the
Prospectus related to the Registration Statement to make changes necessary to
make the statements in such Registration Statement not misleading or the
statements in such Prospectus not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they were made (which notice shall be accompanied by an instruction to
suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been
made).  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 (k) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance or obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement referred to in Section 2.4(j)(iii) at the earliest practicable time. 

   

 (l) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 2.4(j)(v) and following any of the periods set forth in Section 2.5, if the option to suspend an Offering of Subject Securities is exercised by the Company in accordance with Section 2.5, promptly after the termination of such suspension prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the Investor, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Investor in accordance with Section 2.4(j)(v) to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes to the Prospectus have been made by the Company by exercising its option to suspend the Offering of Subject Securities in accordance with Section 2.5, then the Investor shall suspend use of such Prospectus and use its commercially reasonable efforts to return to the Company all copies of such Prospectus (at the Companys expense) other than permanent file copies then in the Investors possession. 

   

 (m) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the Companys transfer agent in settling any Transfer of Subject Securities, including with respect to the transfer of any physical stock certificates representing the Common Stock into book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably requested by the Investor or the Book-Runners.

Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment. The Company

Companys status as a WKSI) or any amendment thereto to be declared effective
by the Commission as soon as practicable and shall file an acceleration
request as soon as practicable following the resolution or clearance of all

    | (iii)  |   | the Company believes that an Offering would require
the Company, under applicable securities laws and other laws, to make
disclosures of material non-public information that would not otherwise be
required to be disclosed at that time and the Company believes in good faith
that such disclosures at that time would not be in the Companys best
interests;  _provided_ , that this exception shall continue to apply only
during the time that such material non-public information has not been
disclosed and remains material; and  
      
    | (iv)  |   | the Company is pursuing a primary underwritten
offering of Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Investor shall have Piggyback Registration rights with
respect to such primary underwritten offering in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.12.  
   

  

 (b) The Company has the right to (y) defer such registration of Subject Securities in response to a Registration Demand or (z) require the Investor to suspend such Offering of Subject Securities: 

       ##### 

  

     

       | (i)  |   | in the case of Section 2.5(a)(i), for all or any
part of its current customary suspension or blackout period, which commences
15 days prior to the end of each calendar quarter and terminates at the end
of the second Business Day after the public release of the Companys earning
information for such calendar quarter, it being understood and acknowledged
that the Company may from time to time and at any time change the duration of
any such customary suspension or blackout period;  
---|---|---|---

 (d) In addition to the rights specified in Section 2.5(a) and (b), the Company shall have the right, exercisable at its option, once in any 365-day period, to (y) defer any registration of Subject Securities, including the exercise of Piggyback Registration rights in accordance with and subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.12, in response to a Registration Demand, or (z) require the Investor to suspend such Offering of Subject Securities for a period of not more than 60 days from the date of receipt of notice of such deferral or suspension, if the Company elects at such time to offer Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents in order to:

exchange offer or other business combination, acquisition of assets or
similar transaction; or

    | (ii)  |   | meet rating agency and other capital funding
requirements.  
   

  

 If the Company defers such registration of Subject Securities in response to a Registration Demand or requires the Investor to suspend such Offering of Subject Securities, the Investor shall be entitled to withdraw such Registration Demand or such Offering Notice, as the case may be, and if it does so, such request shall not be treated for any purpose as an exercise of a Registration Demand or the delivery of an Offering Notice pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, as applicable. 

   

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, the prohibitions set forth in this Section 2.5 shall not apply to any sales of Subject Securities made by the Investor pursuant to Rule 144 to the extent permitted under Section 2.8(d)(iii). 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 2.6 _Delay of Registration; Furnishing Information._  

   

 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.2, the Investor shall not have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration, other than either a Demand Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement, as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Article II. 

   

 (b) The Investor shall not use, and shall not permit the underwriters of any Offering to use, any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in connection with the sale of Subject Securities without the prior written consent of the Company. 

   

 (c) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 2.1 that the Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Subject Securities or other securities issued by the Company held by it and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of the Subject Securities. 

   

 Section 2.7 _Indemnification; Contribution._  

   

 (a) The Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Investor and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and each Person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (joint or several) and expenses to which they may become subject under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal or state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon a Violation (as defined below) except insofar as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating to the Investor furnished in writing to the Company by the Investor expressly for use therein. In connection with an Offering, the Company shall indemnify the Book-Runners, their officers, employees and directors and each Person who controls the Book-Runners (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Investor. For purposes of this Section 2.7, a "Violation" shall mean: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, including any Prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" as such term is defined under Rule 433 under the Securities Act or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or allegedly necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 

   

 (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Investor is participating, the Investor shall furnish to the Company in writing such information relating to the Investor as the Company reasonably requests relating to (i) the legal name of the Investor; (ii) the address of the Investor; (iii) the Beneficial Ownership of the Subject Securities of the Investor included in such Registration Statement and any Common Stock or any class of Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities) held by the Investor; and (iv) the 

      ##### 

  

    

plan of distribution (to extent that information relating to the plan of
distribution would customarily be provided by a selling securityholder of the
types of Subject Securities included in such Registration Statement), in each
case for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
prospectus, and shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Company and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and each Person
who Controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (joint or several) and expenses to
which they may become subject under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or
other federal or state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon a Violation insofar as such Violation is made in reliance and in
conformity with information relating to the Investor furnished in writing to
the Company by the Investor expressly for use therein. 

   

 (c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party that are in addition to or may conflict with those available to another indemnified party with respect to such claim. Failure to give prompt written notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations hereunder. 

   

 (d) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 2.7 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement or any underwriting agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Investor and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and each Person who controls the Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act), (iii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and (iv) the consummation of the Transfer of the Subject Securities. 

   

 (e) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this Section 2.7 is due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the Violation or Violations that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other shall be 

      ##### 

  

    

determined by reference to, among other things, whether the Violation relates
to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified
party, and by such partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such Violation. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person that
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In no event shall the
liability of the Investor be greater in amount than the amount of net
proceeds received by the Investor in such sale. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section
2.7(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not account for the equitable considerations referred to
in this Section 2.7(e). 

   

 Section 2.8 _Lock-Ups and Transfer Restrictions._

related Common Equity Units; and _provided_ , _further_ , that during the

Agreement and Section 4.2 of the Indemnification Control Agreement. For this
purpose, (A) each share of

of the Investor Common Stock, Closing Preferred Stock, Transferable Preferred
Stock, Common Equity Units or Unit Preferred Stock are transferred or
affected); _provided_ , that any Transfer made pursuant to this Section
2.8(d)(ii) shall be treated as if such Transfer was an Offering subject to
the limits, conditions and restrictions on Offerings set forth in Sections
2.1 through 2.7; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any Transfer made
pursuant to this Section 2.8(d)(ii) and any Offering made pursuant to Section

restrictions set forth in Sections 2.1 through 2.7; or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (iii)  |   | after the earlier of (A) the date that is 540
days after the Closing Date and (B) the date on which the aggregate value of
the remaining Subject Securities is less than $1 billion (calculated, (x) in
the case of Investor Common Stock, by reference to the volume weighted
average trading price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over
the period of 20 trading days preceding the date of determination, (y) in the
case of Transferable Preferred Stock, by reference to the volume weighted
average trading price of the Transferable Preferred Stock on the New York

days preceding the date of determination, and (z) in the case of Common
Equity Units, by reference to their aggregate Stated Amount), in compliance
with the volume and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144(e) and (f)
(regardless of whether such requirements are applicable by law);  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

 _provided_ , that in the case of a Transfer described in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) of this Section 2.8(d), unless otherwise approved by the Company, (y)
no transferee shall acquire, in any transaction or series of related
transactions, Subject Securities that would represent 3.5% or more of the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company (in the case of (A) the Transferable
Preferred Stock, measured, without giving effect to the Transfer, using the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Transferable
Preferred Stock would be convertible if the approval of the stockholders of
the Company required for such conversion had been obtained, and (B) the
Common Equity Units, measured, without giving effect to the Transfer, using
the number of shares of Unit Common Stock that would be transferred pursuant
to the Stock Purchase Contracts forming part of such Common Equity Units,
which is calculated by dividing the aggregate Stated Amount of the
Common Equity Units which the Investor proposes to include in such Transfer
by the Threshold Appreciation Price), and (z) to the actual knowledge of the
Investor, no transferee or Group of affiliated transferees shall acquire
Subject Securities that, together with any shares of Common Stock
already Beneficially Owned by such transferee or Group, would represent more
than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company (in the case of (A)
the Transferable Preferred Stock, measured, without giving effect to the
Transfer, using the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
of Transferable Preferred Stock would be convertible if the approval of the
stockholders of the Company required for such conversion had been obtained
(B) the Common Equity Units, measured, without giving effect to the Transfer,
using the number of shares of Unit Common Stock that would be transferred
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contracts forming part of such Common Equity
Units, which is calculated by dividing the aggregate Stated Amount of the
Common Equity Units which the Investor proposes to include in such Transfer
by the Threshold Appreciation Price); and _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all
such Transfers are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Investor shall not Transfer any of the Stock
Purchase Contracts other than in a Transfer of the related Common Equity
Units. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section 2.8, without the Companys prior written consent, the Investor may not Transfer the Closing Preferred Stock prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, other than in a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee or the Company. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (f) Any Transfer, or any Transfer arising out of a Permitted Pledge, to a Permitted Transferee shall be subject to the condition that such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as further set forth in Section 2.9. 

   

 (g) The Investor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to Transfer all Subject Securities held by the Investor and any Permitted Transferees to Persons who are not Affiliates of the Investor or such Permitted Transferees prior to the later of (y) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (z) the first anniversary of the Third Stock Purchase Date. 

   

 (h) For so long as the Investor or any of the Permitted Transferees directly or indirectly owns any of the Subject Securities, Parent shall not permit the Transfer, directly or indirectly, of any equity interest in the Investor if, as a result of such Transfer, the Investor would no longer be an Affiliate of Parent subject to the control (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Transfer, directly or indirectly, of any equity interest in the Investor which results in Parent no longer having control (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Investor shall be permitted solely on the condition that Parent guarantees all obligations of the Investor hereunder and, for the avoidance of doubt, no such Transfer shall affect the obligations of the Investor hereunder. 

   

 Section 2.9 _Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights of the Investor to registration of all or any portion of Subject Securities pursuant to Article II of this Agreement may be assigned by the Investor to a Permitted Transferee, to the extent of the Subject Securities Transferred, in connection with a Transfer of not less than $500 million in Subject Securities in accordance with Section 2.8(d)(ii) and (iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Investor shall, within ten days after such Transfer, furnish to the Company written notice specifying the details of the Transfer to the Permitted Transferee and (ii) such Permitted Transferee acquires such Subject Securities in a transaction in accordance with Section 2.8 and agrees, following such Transfer, to be subject to all applicable restrictions and obligations set forth in the Subject Securities so Transferred and this Agreement, in which case the applicable Permitted Transferee shall be the beneficiary to all rights of the Investor and subject to all restrictions and obligations applicable to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement, to the same extent as the Investor as provided in Section 3.1;  _provided_ , _further_ , that no assignment of registration or other rights pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall be permitted if such assignment would in any manner expand the obligations of the Company in the aggregate. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Standstill._  

   

 (a) Parent and the Investor covenant to and agree with the Company that neither the Parent nor the Investor nor any of their respective Affiliates, or any of the respective directors, officers or employees of Parent, the Investor or such Affiliates shall, either directly or indirectly or acting alone or as part of a Group:

2.10;  
      
    | (x)  |   | take any action, or make or permit any of its and

Parent, the Investor and their respective Affiliates shall immediately notify
the Company in writing if any of them or, to their knowledge, any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other
representatives, is contacted by any Person in regard to any of the actions
described in clauses (i)-(xi) above. Such notice shall provide full disclosure
to the

any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other
representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend, waive or terminate any

a previously unaffiliated business entity that Beneficially Owns Common Stock
or Other Voting Securities, or any securities convertible into, or

the time of the consummation of such acquisition, provided that in connection
with any such acquisition, Parent, the Investor or the applicable Affiliate,
as the case may be (A) either (y) causes such entity to divest the Common
Stock or Other Voting Securities, or any securities convertible into, or
exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities,
Beneficially Owned by the acquired entity prior to the consummation of such
acquisition or (z) divests the Common Stock or Other Voting Securities, or
any other securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for,
Common Stock or Other Voting Securities, Beneficially Owned by Parent, the
Investor or any of their respective Affiliates, acting alone or as part of a
Group, directly or indirectly, in an amount so that Parent, the Investor and
their respective Affiliates, together with such acquired business entity,
shall not, acting alone or as part of a Group, directly or indirectly,
Beneficially Own more than 23.5% of the Common Stock or any class of Other
Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities
issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible
into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting
Securities) following the consummation of such acquisition, and (B) if any
annual or special meeting of stockholders is  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | held prior to the disposition thereof, votes such
shares of Common Stock or Other Voting Securities on each matter presented at
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders or by written consent in
the same proportion as the shares voted by all other holders of Common Stock
or Other Voting Securities, including the shares voted by the Policyholder
Trust and the Benefit Plan Trusts (other than Parent, the Investor or any of
their respective Affiliates), voting on such matter;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

 _provided_ that, in the case of each of (i) through (v) of this Section
2.10(b), (y) such ordinary course business activities shall be made without
the intent to influence the control of the Company and (z) Parent, the
Investor or any of their respective Affiliates shall not, acting alone or
as part of a Group, directly or indirectly, at any time Beneficially Own more
than 23.5% of the Common Stock or any class of Other Voting Securities
(including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into,
or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities),
and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent, the Investor or any of their
Affiliates shall not use any Confidential Material in connection with such
ordinary course business activities; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities held,
directly or indirectly, in any discretionary accounts by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, that could be considered Beneficially Owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, the Investor or any of their respective
Affiliates, acting alone or as part of a Group, shall be so considered for
the purposes of this Agreement, and therefore subject to the prohibition on
the Beneficial Ownership of more than 23.5% of the Common Stock or Other
Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities
issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible
into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting
Securities) set forth in Section 2.10(c) and the option to repurchase set
forth in Section 2.10(e). 

   

 (c) Parent, the Investor or any of their respective Affiliates shall not, acting alone or as part of a Group, directly or indirectly, at any time, Beneficially Own more that 23.5% of the Common Stock or any class of Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities). 

   

 (d) In the event that the Company plans to effect an accelerated share repurchase program or similar program, the Investor shall have a right of first refusal to accept the Companys repurchase offer and to sell to the Company the full amount of Subject Securities that the Company seeks to repurchase on the terms that the Company offers. If the Investor refuses the Companys offer or declines to accept such offer within five days from the date of receipt of written notice of the Companys intent to make such a share repurchase, the Company may effect the accelerated share repurchases as originally proposed. The Company may also effect at any time a share repurchase program of a type not described in the first sentence of this Section 2.10(d). 

   

 (e) In the event that the Company plans to effect a share repurchase program for its Common Stock or Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities) that could result in 

      ##### 

  

    

Parent, the Investor or any of their respective Affiliates, acting alone or as
part of a Group, directly or indirectly, either (i) Beneficially Owning more
than 23.5% of the outstanding Common Stock or such class of Other Voting
Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable
upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into,
or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities)
or (ii) having a Total BHC Ownership Level in excess of 23.5%, the Company
agrees that it shall either (A) not effect such share repurchase program or
(B) repurchase from the Investor, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, and the Investor agrees that it shall sell, or cause
to be sold to the Company, an amount of the Subject Securities (of the same
class as the securities to be repurchased by the Company) held by Parent, the
Investor or any of their respective Affiliates necessary, so that during the
course of and upon the completion of such share repurchase program, neither
Parent, the Investor nor any of their respective Affiliates, acting alone or
as part of a Group, directly or indirectly, either (A) Beneficially Own more
than 23.5% of the Common Stock or such class of Other Voting Securities
(including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or
exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or such Other Voting
Securities) or (B) have a Total BHC Ownership Level in excess of 23.5%. In
the event that the Company elects, in accordance with the preceding sentence,
to repurchase its Common Stock or Other Voting Securities, the Company shall
repurchase, and the Investor shall sell, or cause to be sold, such Subject
Securities at a price per Subject Security calculated, (x) in the case of
Investor Common Stock, by reference to the volume weighted average trading
price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the period of
20 trading days preceding the date of determination, (y) in the case of
Transferable Preferred Stock, by reference to the volume weighted average
trading price of the Transferable Preferred Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, or other applicable exchange, over the period of 20 trading days
preceding the date of determination, and (z) in the case of Common Equity
Units, at their fair market value as determined by the Valuation Agent using
the methodologies set forth in Section 11.05(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter). 

   

 (f) At the Closing Date and thereafter, the Total BHC Ownership Level with respect to Common Stock or with respect to any class of Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities) shall not, at any time, be in excess of 23.5%; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Common Stock or Other Voting Securities held, directly or indirectly, in any discretionary accounts by Parent or any of its Affiliates, that could be considered part of the Total BHC Ownership Level with respect to the applicable class of voting securities, shall be so considered for the purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) The Investor, Parent or their respective Affiliates, acting alone or as part of a Group, directly or indirectly, shall not take any action to effect any transfer of "control" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the management and policies of the Company or any of its Affiliates, nor does the Investor, Parent or the Company intend any such transfer of "control" to occur as a result or in connection with any or all of the transactions described in the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (h) In the event that Parent, the Investor or any of their respective Affiliates, acting alone or as part of a Group, directly or indirectly, at any time, Beneficially Own more than 22.5% of the Common Stock or any class of Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or such Other Voting Securities), the Investor shall provide written notice to the Company of the details of such ownership within ten days following the date on which such Beneficial Ownership exceeds 22.5% of the Common Stock or Other Voting Securities (including any Common Stock or Other Voting Securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of or any securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or such Other Voting Securities). 

   

 Section 2.11 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the Investor the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule 144, which may permit the sale of the Subject Securities to the public without registration under the Securities Act, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to: 

   

 (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of this Agreement; 

   

 (b) file with the Commission, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and 

   

 (c) so long as the Investor owns any Subject Securities, furnish to the Investor forthwith upon request: a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and of the Exchange Act; a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company; and such other reports and documents as the Investor may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing it to sell any such Subject Securities without registration. 

   

 Section 2.12 _Piggyback Registration Rights._  

   

 (a) Whenever the Company proposes in an underwritten offering to publicly sell or register for sale any of its common equity securities pursuant to a registration statement whether for its own account or for the account of one or more stockholders of the Company, the Investor may participate in such underwritten offering, except for (i) offerings in connection with registrations of securities of the Company on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any similar successor forms thereto, or (ii) offerings in connection with employee benefit, dividend reinvestment or similar plans (participation under such circumstances is referred to as a "Piggyback Registration"); _provided_ , that after any such offer and sale, the Investor maintains adequate security pursuant to the indemnification provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement as provided in Section 2.7. 

   

 (b) If a Piggyback Registration is initiated in connection with a registration relating to an underwritten offering on behalf of the Company, and the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without having an adverse 

      ##### 

  

    

effect on such offering, including the price at which such securities can be
sold, then the Company shall include in such registration the maximum number
of securities that such underwriter advises can be so sold without having
such effect, allocated (i) first, to the securities the Company proposes to
sell, (ii) second, to the Subject Securities requested to be included
therein by the Investor, and (iii) third, among other securities requested to
be included in such registration by other securityholders of the Company on
such basis as such holders may agree among themselves and the Company. 

   

 (c) Subject to Sections 2.5(a)(iv) and 2.5(d), if a Piggyback Registration is initiated in connection with a registration relating to an underwritten offering on behalf of a holder of the Companys securities (including the Investor, solely with respect to the Subject Securities) and the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without having an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such securities can be sold, then the Company shall include in such registration the maximum number of securities that such underwriter advises can be so sold without having such effect, allocated (i) first, to the securities requested to be included therein by the holder(s) requesting such registration and (ii) second, to other securities (including Subject Securities) requested to be included in such registration by other securityholders, the Company and the Investor. 

   

 (d) The Company shall provide six Business Days notice to the Investor prior to the launch of any such underwritten offering of common equity securities whether for its own account or for the account of one or more stockholders of the Company, to allow the Investor to exercise its Piggyback Registration rights under this Section 2.12; _provided_ , that the Company may provide the Investor with less than six Business Days notice solely in the event that the Company reasonably determines in good faith, in light of the circumstances at that time, that it is reasonably necessary to conduct an offering of equity securities within fewer than six Business Days (in which case the Company shall give the Investor as much advance notice of such offering as possible). The Investor shall confirm by way of a written notice to the Company that it intends to exercise such Piggyback Registration rights, to be received by the Company no later than the second Business Day prior to the launch of the Offering. In the event that the Company conducts such a primary underwritten offering of common equity securities, and the Investor chooses not to exercise its Piggyback Registration rights, the Investor shall not Transfer any Subject Securities except in accordance with Section 2.13. 

   

 Section 2.13 _Market Stand-Off._  

   

 (a) With respect to any underwritten offering of Common Stock by the Company, Parent and the Investor shall not, if requested to stand-off by the Company, sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise Transfer any Subject Securities owned by Parent, the Investor or any of their respective Affiliates (other than (i) to a Permitted Transferee or to the Company, or (ii) the Subject Securities included in such offering following the exercise of the Investors Piggyback Registration rights set forth in Section 2.12) without the prior written consent of the Company and the underwriter(s), during a period commencing on the date of such stand-off request and ending 60 days following the settlement date of such offering. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Subject Securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of the required stand-off period and shall lift such stop-transfer restrictions immediately upon the end of such period. 

   

 (c) The Company, if reasonably requested in writing by the Book-Runners for an Offering, shall not make any public sale or other distribution of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock during the two Business Days prior to and 60 days after the settlement date of such Offering by the Investor of the Subject Securities, except for (i) offerings in connection with registrations of securities of the Company on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any similar successor forms thereto, or (ii) offerings in connection with employee benefit, dividend reinvestment or similar plans. 

   

 Section 2.14 _Voting_. The Investor shall, and Parent shall cause any Permitted Transferee or other Affiliate of Parent holding Common Stock or Other Voting Securities to: 

   

 (a) be present, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of stockholders of the Company so that all Common Stock or Other Voting Securities directly or indirectly owned by the Investor and, if applicable, any Permitted Transferee, may be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings; and 

   

 (b) vote all of the Common Stock or Other Voting Securities directly or indirectly owned by the Investor and, if applicable, any Permitted Transferee or other Affiliate, in the same proportion as the shares of Common Stock or Other Voting Securities voted by all other holders of Common Stock or Other Voting Securities (as the case may be), including the shares of Common Stock or Other Voting Securities voted by the Policyholder Trust and the Benefit Plan Trusts, and shall deliver to the Company a proxy authorizing management of the Company to so vote the Common Stock or Other Voting Securities. 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations set forth in this Section 2.14
shall not apply in the case of Common Stock or Other Voting Securities that
do not constitute Subject Securities unless the failure of the obligations in
Section 2.14(b) to apply shall cause the Investor, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to be found to control the Company for purposes of the
BHC Act. If the failure of the obligations in Section 2.14(b) to apply shall
cause the Investor, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to be found
to control the Company for purposes of the BHC Act, then (notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence) such obligations shall apply to the extent
necessary so that the Investor, Parent and their Affiliates shall not be found
to control the Company for purposes of the BHC Act. 

   

 Section 2.15 _Security Interest_. If the Investor Transfers any of the Investor Common Stock, Closing Preferred Stock, Transferable Preferred Stock, Common Equity Units, Stock Purchase Contracts, Unit Preferred Stock or Debt Securities that are subject to any custody or other security arrangement securing the Investor Indemnification Obligations, the Investor shall take any and all actions necessary to ensure that the Company has a valid first priority security interest in any proceeds resulting from such transaction in accordance with the Indemnification Control Agreement.

Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and be of no effect), and nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Common Equity Units on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in writing and to each Holder of Common Equity Units in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.

to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the
Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the
Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable
record date.

Stripped Common Equity Unit, such Holders interest in the Treasury
Securities forming a part of such Stripped Common Equity Unit, to the
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the
right, title and interest of such Holder in (i) the one-fortieth (1/40)
undivided beneficial interest in the Series C Treasury Security forming part
of such Stripped Common Equity Unit to secure the obligation of such Holder
under the Series C Stock Purchase Contract forming part of such Stripped
Common Equity Unit; (ii) the one-fortieth (1/40) undivided beneficial
interest in the Series D Treasury Security forming part of such Stripped
Common Equity Unit to secure the obligation of such Holder under the Series D
Stock Purchase Contract forming part of such Stripped Common Equity Unit; and
(iii) the one-fortieth (1/40) undivided beneficial interest in the Series E
Treasury Security forming part of such Stripped Common Equity Unit to secure
the obligation of such Holder under the Series E Stock Purchase Contract
forming part of such Stripped Common Equity Unit. 

  

 No Stock Purchase Contract shall, prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under such Stock Purchase Contract, entitle the Holder of a Common Equity Unit to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent to or receive notice as a stockholder in respect of the meetings of stockholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a holder of Common Stock of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 3.3 _Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating_. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.12 and Section 3.13, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Company may deliver Certificates executed by the Company to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for authentication, execution on behalf of the Holders and delivery, together with a written order from the Company for authentication of such Certificates, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with such written order, authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders and deliver such Certificates. 

  

 The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Chief Financial Officer, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Certificates may be manual or facsimile. 

  

 Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time such signature was affixed thereto, the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such Certificates. 

  

 No Stock Purchase Contract evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, as such Holders attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized officer of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Stock Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Certificate. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Each Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication. 

  

 No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by an authorized officer of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 3.4 _Temporary Certificates_. Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders, and deliver, in lieu of such definitive Certificates, temporary Certificates that are in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, with such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as may be required by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as applicable, may be listed, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Certificates. 

  

 If temporary Certificates are issued, the Company will cause definitive Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Certificates, the temporary Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates upon surrender of the temporary Certificates at the Corporate Trust Office, at the expense of the Company and without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Certificates of like tenor and denominations and evidencing a like number of Common Equity Units as the temporary Certificate or Certificates so surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Certificates shall in all respects evidence the same benefits and the same obligations with respect to the Common Equity Units evidenced thereby as definitive Certificates. 

  

 SECTION 3.5 _Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange_. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall provide for the registration and transfers of Certificates (the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, in such capacity, the "Security Registrar"). The Security Registrar shall record separately the registration and transfer of the Certificates evidencing Normal Common Equity Units and Stripped Common Equity Units. 

  

 Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the designated transferee or transferees, and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of any authorized denominations, of like tenor, and evidencing a like number of Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as the case may be; _provided_ , 

   ##### 

  

    

 _however_ , that (i) Certificates so executed, authenticated and delivered
upon a transfer of any interest in a Certificate bearing the Private
Placement Legend shall also bear the Private Placement Legend unless there is
delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Company an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company and addressed to the
Company to the effect, or other reasonable proof, that such Private Placement
Legend need not be applied to such Certificates; and (ii) the Stock Purchase
Contract Agent and the Company may refuse to effect any transfer of
an interest in a Certificate unless there is delivered to the Stock Purchase
Contract Agent and the Company an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Company and addressed to the Company to the effect, or other
reasonable proof, that such transfer complies with the registration
and prospectus-delivery requirements of the Securities Act or is exempt from
such requirements. 

  

 At the option of the Holder, Certificates evidencing Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units may be exchanged for other Certificates, of any authorized denominations and evidencing a like number of Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, respectively, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Certificate to be exchanged (including any Certificate to be exchanged pursuant to a Collateral Substitution pursuant to Section 3.12 or Section 3.13) bears the Private Placement Legend, then the Certificate(s) so authenticated, executed and delivered in exchange therefor shall also bear the Private Placement Legend unless there is delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Company an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company and addressed to the Company to the effect, or other reasonable proof, that such Private Placement Legend need not be applied to such Certificate(s). 

  

 All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations under this Agreement as, the Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as applicable, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 

  

 Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. 

  

 No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Security Registrar may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 3.6 and Section 8.5 not involving any transfer. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver any Certificate in exchange for any other Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest to occur of any Early Settlement Date with respect to the Common Equity Units evidenced by such Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to the Common Equity Units evidenced by such Certificate, the Third Stock Purchase Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall: 

   

 (i) if the Third Stock Purchase Date (including upon any Cash Settlement) or an Early Settlement Date or a Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to the Certificate surrendered for exchange or transfer has occurred, deliver to such Holder the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Common Equity Units evidenced by such Certificate; 

   

 (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the First Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series C Preferred Securities or Series C Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered for exchange or transfer, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V; 

   

 (iii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Second Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series D Preferred Securities or the Series D Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered for exchange or transfer, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V; or 

   

 (iv) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Third Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series E Preferred Securities or Series E Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered for exchange or transfer, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the transfer, by the Initial Holder of any interest in a Common Equity Unit shall be subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, dated the date hereof, among the Company, the Initial Holder and American International Group, Inc. 

  

 SECTION 3.6 _Book-Entry Interests_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall apply if, and only if, the Company elects, in its sole and 

   ##### 

  

    

absolute discretion, to issue the Certificates in the form of one or more
fully registered Global Certificates; and (ii) the Certificates will not
initially be issued in the form of Global Certificates. 

  

 The Certificates to be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates shall be delivered to the Depositary or its custodian by, or on behalf of, the Company. The Company hereby designates DTC as the initial Depositary. Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books of the Security Registrar in the name of Cede and Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owners interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.8. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall enter into an agreement with the Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.8: 

   

 (i) the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall be in full force and effect; 

   

 (ii) the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Security Registrar shall be entitled to deal with the Depositary for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, making Contract Payments and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Common Equity Units and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners; _provided_ that any Beneficial Owner may directly enforce against the Company, without the involvement of the Depositary or any other Person, its right to receive definitive Certificates pursuant to Section 3.8; 

   

 (iii) subject to the first paragraph of this Section 3.6, to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.6 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall control; and 

   

 (iv) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Depositary or the Depositary Participants; _provided_ that any Beneficial Owner may directly enforce against the Company, without the involvement of the Depositary or any other Person, its right to receive definitive Certificates pursuant to Section 3.8. 

  

 Transfers of securities evidenced by Global Certificates shall be made through the facilities of the Depositary, and any cancellation of, or increase or decrease in the number of, such securities (including the creation of Stripped Common Equity Units and the recreation of Normal Common Equity Units pursuant to Section 3.12 and Section 3.13, respectively) shall be accomplished by making appropriate annotations on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases for such Global Certificate. 

  

 SECTION 3.7 _Appointment of Successor Depositary_. If the Common Units are represented in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates and the Depositary elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to such Common Equity Units, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Common Equity Units. 

    ##### 

 

  

 SECTION 3.8 _Definitive Certificates_. If: 

    

 (i) the Common Units are represented by one or more fully registered Global Certificates; and 

   

 (ii) either: 

   

 (1) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Depositary with respect to the Common Equity Units and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.7 within ninety (90) days after such notice; or 

   

 (2) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.7 within ninety (90) days after such notice; or 

   

 (3) any default has occurred and is continuing under this Agreement or the terms of any series of Debt Securities; or 

   

 (4) a Beneficial Owner provides a written request, upon sixty (60) days prior notice, that such Beneficial Owners interest in the Common Units represented by a registered Global Certificate is to be exchanged for an equivalent interest in the Common Units represented by definitive Certificate. 

 

then (x) definitive Certificates may be prepared by the Company with respect
to such Common Equity Units and delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract
Agent and (y) upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the
Common Equity Units by the Depositary, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to
be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the
Depositary. The Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be
liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively
rely on, and shall be authorized and protected in relying on, such
instructions. Each definitive Certificate so delivered shall evidence Common
Equity Units of the same kind and tenor as the Global Certificate so
surrendered in respect thereof. 

   

 SECTION 3.9 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates_. If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. 

  

 If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Stock Purchase Contract 

   #####

the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New
York), the Company shall execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract
Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on
behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any
such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the
same number of Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units, as
the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously
outstanding. 

   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate, any Stock Purchase Date, or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall: 

   

 (i) if the Third Stock Purchase Date (including upon any Cash Settlement) or an Early Settlement Date or a Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate has occurred, deliver to such Holder the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Common Equity Units evidenced by such Certificate; 

   

 (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the First Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series C Preferred Securities or Series C Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V; 

   

 (iii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Second Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series D Preferred Securities or Series D Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V; or 

   

 (iv) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Third Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Series E Preferred Securities or Series E Debt Securities, as applicable, or the Treasury Securities pledged in lieu thereof, as the case may be, evidenced by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate, to such Holder, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.14 and Article V. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent) connected therewith. 

  

 Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Common Equity Units evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Common Equity Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. 

  

 The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. 

  

 SECTION 3.10 _Persons Deemed Owners_. Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Common Equity Units evidenced thereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution on the Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, payment of Contract Payments and performance of the Stock Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Common Equity Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary; and none of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Security Registrar, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate, or impair, as between such Depositary and the related Beneficial Owner, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Security Registrar, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. 

  

 SECTION 3.11 _Cancellation_. All Certificates surrendered for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after the Third Stock Purchase Date, all Certificates surrendered for delivery of Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after 

   ##### 

  

 

the occurrence of a Termination Event, all Certificates surrendered pursuant
to a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement,
and all Certificates surrendered for the registration of transfer or exchange
of a Common Equity Unit, or for a Collateral Substitution, shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Stock Purchase Contract Agent,
be delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent along with appropriate
written instructions from the Company regarding the cancellation thereof and,
if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by the Stock Purchase
Contract Agent. The Company may at any time deliver to the Stock Purchase
Contract Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated,
executed and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon an Issuer
Order, be promptly cancelled by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent. No
Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder
and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
All cancelled Certificates held by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be
disposed of in accordance with its customary practices. 

   

 If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation. 

  

 SECTION 3.12 _Creation of Stripped Common Equity Units by Substitution of Treasury Securities_. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder of Normal Common Equity Units may, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement (but not during the period that begins at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately preceding any scheduled Stock Purchase Date and ends at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such scheduled Stock Purchase Date), exchange such Normal Common Equity Units for Stripped Common Equity Units and Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable; _provided_ that Holders may make such exchange only in integral multiples of forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units. To effect such exchange, the Holder must, for each forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units to be exchanged, perform each of the following: 

   

 (i) if such exchange is made prior to the First Stock Purchase Date, deposit with the Collateral Agent one (1) Series C Treasury Security having a principal amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000); 

   

 (ii) if such exchange is made prior to the Second Stock Purchase Date, deposit with the Collateral Agent one (1) Series D Treasury Security having a principal amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000); 

   

 (iii) deposit with the Collateral Agent one (1) Series E Treasury Security having a principal amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000); and 

   

 (iv) transfer forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C, (i) stating that the Holder has deposited the relevant amount of Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary for credit to the Collateral Account; and (ii) instructing the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to instruct the 

   ##### 

  

    

Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Preferred Securities or Pledged
Debt Securities, as applicable, forming part of such Normal Common Equity
Units, whereupon the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly provide an
instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form
of Exhibit A to the Pledge Agreement. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such exchange shall be made at any time when there does not exist an unmatured Treasury Security that would be required, pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, to be delivered to effect such exchange. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and the instruction described in clause (iv) above, the Collateral Agent shall, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of such Pledged Preferred Securities or Pledged Debt Securities, as applicable, from the Pledge and the transfer of such Preferred Securities to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent on behalf of the Holder free and clear of the Companys security interest therein. Upon receipt of such Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: 

   

 (i) cancel the related Normal Common Equity Units; 

   

 (ii) transfer such Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, to such Holder (such Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, shall be tradeable as a separate security, independent of the resulting Stripped Common Equity Units); and 

   

 (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificates executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing (A) the same number of Stock Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Normal Common Equity Units; and (B) the Pledged Treasury Securities substituted for such Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable. 

  

 Holders who elect to exchange Normal Common Equity Units for Stripped Common Equity Units and Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 3.12 shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of such exchange, and neither the Company nor the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. 

  

 In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.12 fails to transfer the Normal Common Equity Units to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary, any distributions on the Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, constituting a part of such Normal Common Equity Units shall be held in the name of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Normal Common Equity Units are so transferred, or until such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent that the applicable Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Except as set forth in Section 5.2 or in this Section 3.12 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, or in order to sell any Pledged Debt Securities to the Company pursuant to the due exercise of the related Put Right, for so long as the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying a Normal Common Equity Unit remain in effect, such Normal Common Equity Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder in respect of the Pledged Preferred Securities or Pledged Debt Securities, as applicable, and in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts comprising such Normal Common Equity Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Normal Common Equity Unit. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Treasury Security forming part of a Stripped Common Equity Unit matures prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, then (i) the proceeds thereof at such maturity shall be invested at the sole direction of the Company; and (ii) for all purposes under this Agreement (other than for purposes of the first sentence of the second paragraph of this Section 3.12 and for purposes of the second proviso to the first sentence of Section 3.13), such Treasury Security shall be deemed to have matured on the applicable Stock Purchase Date.

Securities or Separate Debt Securities, as applicable. 

   

 SECTION 4.2 _Notice and Voting_. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Preferred Securities and/or Pledged Debt Securities, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as set forth below.

 (ii) If a Final Failed Remarketing for any series of the Debt Securities occurs, then (A) pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect to all Debt Securities of such series which constitute part of any Normal Common Equity Unit; and (B) subject to applicable law and Section 5.2(c), the Collateral Agent may, among other things, (1) retain such Debt Securities in full satisfaction of the Holders obligations under the related Stock Purchase Contracts or (2) sell such Debt Securities in one or more public or private sales or otherwise.

   ##### 

  

    

Remarketing of a series of Debt Securities, Holders of Separate Debt
Securities of such series may elect to have such Separate Debt Securities
included in such Remarketing by delivering such Separate Debt Securities,
along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit G
to the Pledge Agreement, to the Custodial Agent;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Holder of
a Separate Debt Security may so elect to include such Separate Debt Security
in a Remarketing, unless the principal amount of such Separate Debt Security
(and, if such Separate Debt Security is a Unit Debt Security, the principal
amount of each tranche of Component Debt Securities forming part of such
Separate Debt Security) is an integral multiple of one thousand dollars
($1,000). At 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the twenty fifth
(25th) Business Day immediately preceding the applicable scheduled Stock
Purchase Date, such election shall become an irrevocable election to have
such Separate Debt Securities remarketed in such Remarketing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Holder of Separate Debt Securities electing to have its
Separate Debt Securities included in such Remarketing will have the right to
withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially
in the form of Exhibit H to the Pledge Agreement, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the twenty fifth (25th) Business Day immediately preceding
the scheduled Stock Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing, upon which
notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Debt Securities to such
Holder. The Custodial Agent shall hold all Separate Debt Securities to be
included in a Remarketing in an account that is separate from the Collateral
Accounts in which the Pledged Debt Securities shall be held. No later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the twenty fourth (24th) Business Day
immediately preceding the scheduled Stock Purchase Date relating to each
Remarketing, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the
aggregate principal amount of the Separate Debt Securities of the relevant
series to be remarketed. A Holder of any Separate Debt Security that has
so elected (and not duly withdrawn such election) to include such Separate
Debt Security in a Remarketing shall deliver such Separate Debt Security to
the applicable Remarketing Agent no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time)
on the ninth (9th) Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Stock
Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing. 

   

 (iv) The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall give Holders of Common Equity Units, and the Company shall request that the Depositary or its nominee give Depositary Participants holding Common Equity Units or Separate Debt Securities, notice of a Remarketing at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Stock Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing. Such notice will set forth the information required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to Section 10(c)(i) of the relevant Certificate of Designations. 

  

 (b) 

   

 (i) Unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event has occurred prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, each Holder of a Normal Common Equity Unit shall have the right to satisfy such Holders obligations under the related Stock Purchase Contract on such Stock Purchase Date in cash by (A) providing the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the eleventh (11th) Business Day immediately preceding the related scheduled Stock Purchase Date, with a notice substantially the form of Exhibit E of its 

   ##### 

  

    

intention to pay in cash ("Cash Settlement"); and (B) paying, concurrently
with providing such notice, the Purchase Price for such Stock Purchase
Contract for deposit in the Collateral Account, in lawful money of the United
States, by certified or cashiers check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Holders of Normal Common Equity Units
may effect Cash Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) only in integral
multiples of forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units. Promptly following 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the eleventh (11th) Business Day immediately
preceding each scheduled Stock Purchase Date, the Stock Purchase Contract
Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such notices from
Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement by use of a notice substantially
in the form of Exhibit F. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
no event may a Holder elect a Cash Settlement from the time any Remarketing
has priced to, and including, the Stock Purchase Date relating to such
Remarketing. A Holder that has duly elected, in accordance with this Section
5.2(b)(i), Cash Settlement to apply to any Normal Common Equity Units shall,
if the related Remarketing is a Final Failed Remarketing, be deemed to have
elected not to exercise its Put Right with respect to the Debt Securities
forming part of such Normal Common Equity Units. 

   

 (ii) Except as provided in Section 5.6(b)(ii) of the Pledge Agreement, any cash received pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(i)(B) shall be paid to the Company on the applicable Stock Purchase Date in settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. 

   

 (iii) If a Holder of a Normal Common Equity Unit does not duly elect Cash Settlement in accordance with Section 5.2(b)(i) above, then such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of its Pledged Debt Securities pursuant to the next applicable Remarketing. 

   

 (iv) If Cash Settlement applies to any integral multiple of forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units in respect of a Stock Purchase Date, then: 

   

 (1) the Company shall have no obligation to include, in the Remarketing relating to such Stock Purchase Date, or to resell, pursuant to such Remarketing, the Pledged Debt Securities that form part of such Normal Common Equity Units and that are of the series to be remarketed in such Remarketing; 

   

 (2) if such Remarketing is Successful or a Final Failed Remarketing, then the Company shall, as soon a reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day, after such Stock Purchase Date, cause such Pledged Debt Securities to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent, free and clear of the Companys security interest therein, and transferred to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder of such Normal Common Equity Units, and, upon receipt of such Pledged Debt Securities, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly transfer such Pledged Debt Securities to such Holder; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (3) if such Remarketing is not Successful and is not a Final Failed Remarketing, then such Cash Settlement election shall be deemed to be rescinded and the Collateral Agent shall make the deliveries set forth in Section 5.6(b)(ii) of the Pledge Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this Section 5.2(b)(iv)(3) shall prevent such Holder from thereafter electing Cash Settlement to apply, if otherwise permitted in accordance herewith). 

   

 (v) No later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day preceding the applicable scheduled Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent, based on Cash Settlement notices received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(i) and notices received pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(iii), shall notify the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities to be tendered for purchase in the related Remarketing in a notice pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement. 

   

 (vi) If there has occurred, with respect to a series of Debt Securities, a Failed Remarketing that is not a Final Failed Remarketing, then the applicable Stock Purchase Date relating to such series of Debt Securities shall be deferred to the date that is three (3) calendar months after the Stock Purchase Date prior to such deferral, determined in accordance with Section 1.18. 

  

 (c) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement, or by exercise of the Put Right, are payable solely out of the Proceeds of any Collateral pledged, under the Pledge Agreement, to secure the obligations of the Holders with respect to such Purchase Price, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the Proceeds of the disposition of such Collateral and the Purchase Price. 

  

 (d) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Stock Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Common Equity Units unless the Company shall have received payment for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. 

  

 SECTION 5.3 _Issuance of Shares of Common Stock_. 

  

 Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, and subject to Section 5.4(b), on each Stock Purchase Date, upon receipt of the aggregate Purchase Price payable on such Stock Purchase Date on all Outstanding Common Equity Units, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent (or at the Stock Purchase Contract Agents order), for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Common Equity Units, by book entry transfer or in the form of one or more certificates representing shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders to which the Holders are entitled hereunder with respect to the Common Equity Units on such Stock Purchase Date. Such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with all dividends or distributions on such shares whose record date and payment date occur after such Stock Purchase Date, are hereinafter referred to as the "Stock Purchase Contract Settlement Fund." Each certificate issued representing shares 

   ##### 

  

 

of Common Stock issued upon the settlement of a Stock Purchase Contract shall
bear a legend substantially similar to the Private Placement Legend if the
Certificate representing the Common Equity Unit of which such Stock Purchase
Contract formed a part contained the Private Placement Legend on the
applicable Stock Purchase Date. 

   

 Subject to the foregoing, the Holder of a Certificate shall be entitled (upon surrender of such Certificate to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed), on or after the First Stock Purchase Date, the Second Stock Purchase Date, the Third Stock Purchase Date, the Early Settlement Date or the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, to receive forthwith in exchange therefor, by book entry transfer or in the form of a certificate, that whole number of shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Common Equity Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.9 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Stock Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such surrender is required with respect to the First Stock Purchase Date or the Second Stock Purchase Date. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holders designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Stock Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing the Common Equity Unit of which such Stock Purchase Contract forms a part is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 SECTION 5.4 _Adjustment of Fixed Settlement Rates_. 

  

 Each of the Fixed Settlement Rates will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances: 

  

 (a) _Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, etc_. 

   

 (i) _Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock_. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company: (A) pays a dividend or makes another distribution on Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock payable exclusively in shares of Common Stock; (B) subdivides or splits the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; or (C) combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares of Common Stock (such number, the "Adjustment Factor") which a person who owns only one (1) share of Common Stock immediately before the record date or effective date, as applicable, of such stock dividend, stock distribution, subdivision, split or combination and who is entitled to participate in such stock dividend, stock distribution, subdivision, split or combination would own immediately after giving effect to such 

   ##### 

  

    

stock dividend, stock distribution, subdivision, split or combination (without
giving effect to any arrangement pursuant to such stock dividend, stock
distribution, subdivision, split or combination not to issue fractional
shares of Common Stock). Such adjustment shall become effective immediately
after such record date, in the case of a stock dividend or stock
distribution, and shall become effective at the open of business on such
effective date, in the case of a subdivision, split or combination. 

   

 (ii) _Adjustment for Rights Issue_. If, after the date of this Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plans) to all holders of Common Stock, entitling them to purchase or subscribe for, for a period expiring within sixty (60) days from the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants, shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the VWAPs per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date the Company initially publicly announces such distribution, then each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction: 

   

 (1) the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for such distribution and (2) the total number of additional shares of Common Stock (the "Underlying Shares") underlying such rights, options or warrants; and 

   

 (2) the denominator of which is the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date and (2) a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the aggregate exercise, conversion, exchange or other price at which the Underlying Shares may be subscribed for or purchased pursuant to such rights, options or warrants and (y) the denominator of which is the average of the VWAPs per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date the Company initially publicly announces such distribution. 

   

 Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after such record date. To the extent that such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration (and, as a result, no additional shares of Common Stock are delivered or issued pursuant to such rights or warrants), the Fixed Settlement Rates shall be readjusted to the Fixed Settlement Rates that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery or issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered or issued. 

   

 For the purposes of this Section 5.4(a)(ii) in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders thereof to purchase or subscribe for shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than such average VWAP per share of Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise, conversion, exchange or other price at which the Underlying Shares may be subscribed for or purchased pursuant to such rights, options or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, with the value of such
consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors. 

   

 (iii) _Adjustments for Other Distributions_. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company dividends or distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any of its debt, Capital Stock, securities or assets or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding dividends or distributions to which Section 5.4(a)(i), Section 5.4(a)(ii) or Section 5.4(a)(iv) apply), then each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of this Section 5.4(a)(iii), by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction: 

   

 (1) the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date for such dividend or distribution; and 

   

 (2) the denominator of which is such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of the portion of such debt, Capital Stock, securities, assets, rights, warrants or options dividended or distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock. 

   

 Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after such record date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, in no event shall any adjustment be made, pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, to any Fixed Settlement Rate to the extent, and only to the extent, such adjustment will cause such Fixed Settlement Rate to be negative or an amount that is greater than a fraction whose numerator is twenty five dollars ($25.00) and whose denominator is the par value per share of Common Stock. 

   

 Notwithstanding the preceding two paragraphs, if, after the date of this Agreement, the Company dividends or distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a "Spin-off"), then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction: 

   

 (1) the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the average of the VWAPs of such shares or equity interests distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one (1) share of Common Stock (determined, for purposes of the definition of "VWAP," as if such shares or equity interests were Common Stock) on each Trading Day in the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (the "Spin-off Valuation Period") beginning on, and including, the third (3rd) Trading Day after the effective date of such Spin-off; and (B) the average of the VWAPs per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day in such Spin-off Valuation Period; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (2) the denominator of which is the average of the VWAPs per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day in such Spin-off Valuation Period. 

   

 Each adjustment pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the applicable Spin-off Valuation Period; _provided, however_ , that if a Stock Purchase Date occurs during such Spin-off Valuation Period, then references to ten (10) Trading Days in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the Settlement Rate applicable to the Stock Purchase Contracts relating to such Stock Purchase Date, to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the third (3rd) Trading Day after the effective date of such Spin-off to, and including, such Stock Purchase Date. 

   

 (iv) _Cash Dividends and Distributions_. If, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, pay regular annual cash dividends, or make any other distributions consisting exclusively of cash, to all holders of Common Stock (excluding any regular annual cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend or distribution per share of Common Stock in any fiscal year does not exceed the Dividend Threshold Amount) then each Fixed Settlement Rate will be adjusted as follows: 

   

 (1) in the event of a regular annual cash dividend, each Fixed Settlement Rate will be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date of such dividend, and (B) the denominator of which is such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, minus the excess, if any, of the cash amount per share of such dividend over the Dividend Threshold Amount; and 

   

 (2) in the event of a cash dividend or distribution that is not a regular annual cash dividend, each Fixed Settlement Rates will be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date of such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which is such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock minus the cash amount per share of such dividend or distribution. 

   

 In either case, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after such Ex Date. In the event that any such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rates that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(a)(iv), in no event shall any adjustment be made, pursuant to this Section 5.4(a)(iv), to any Fixed Settlement Rate to the extent, and only to the extent, such adjustment will cause such Fixed Settlement Rate to be negative or an amount that is greater than a fraction whose numerator is twenty five dollars ($25.00) and whose denominator is the par value per share of Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) _Adjustment for Company Tender Offer_. If, after the date of this Agreement, (A) the Company or any subsidiary of the Company pays cash or other consideration to holders of Common Stock in respect of a tender or exchange offer (other than an odd-lot offer) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for Common Stock; and (B) the sum of the aggregate amount of such cash paid and the aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), as of the Tender Offer Expiration Time (as defined below), of such other consideration paid (such sum, the "Aggregate Amount") expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged, and not withdrawn, pursuant to such tender or exchange offer as of the Tender Offer Expiration Time (such tendered or exchanged shares of Common Stock, the "Purchased Shares") exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the first Trading Day after the last date (such last date, the "Tender Offer Expiration Date") on which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as the same may be amended through the Tender Offer Expiration Date), then each Fixed Settlement Rate will be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction: 

   

 (1) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (I) the Aggregate Amount and (II) the product of (a) the average of the VWAPs per share of Common Stock on each Trading Day in the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (the "Offer Valuation Period") commencing on, and including, the Trading Day immediately after Tender Offer Expiration Date and (b) an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last time (the "Tender Offer Expiration Time") at which tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (including all Purchased Shares) less (ii) the Purchased Shares; and 

   

 (2) the denominator of which is equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Tender Offer Expiration Time (including all Purchased Shares) and (II) such average VWAP per share of Common Stock. 

   

Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the close of business
on the last Trading Day of the applicable Offer Valuation Period; _provided_
, _however_ , that if any Stock Purchase Date occurs during the Offer
Valuation Period, then references to the ten (10) Trading Days in clause (1)
above shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the Settlement Rate
applicable to the Stock Purchase Contracts relating to such Stock Purchase
Date, replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from,
and including, the Trading Day immediately after the Tender Offer Expiration
Date to, and including, and such Stock Purchase Date. 

   

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each Fixed Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Fixed Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (vi) _Calculation of Adjustments_. All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rates shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000th) of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share, to the next lower one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share). No adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or a decrease of at least one percent (1%); _provided_ , _however_ , that each adjustments not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and all such adjustments not made shall be made on each Stock Purchase Date, Cash Merger Early Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date. 

   

 (vii) _Adjustments to the Reference Price and Threshold Appreciation Price_. If any adjustment is made to the Fixed Settlement Rates pursuant to this Section 5.4(a), then, at the time such adjustment becomes effective, each of the Reference Price and the Threshold Appreciation Price shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the product of (1) Reference Price or Threshold Appreciation Price, as applicable, as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Maximum Settlement Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates and whose denominator is the Maximum Settlement Rate to be in effect immediately after such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates. 

   

 (viii) _When No Adjustment Required_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment of the Fixed Settlement Rates, and the number of shares to be delivered on Early Settlement need be made as a result of: (1) the issuance of rights pursuant to the Companys stockholder rights plan existing on the date of this Agreement, as such plan may be amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time, or any newly adopted stockholder rights plans; (2) the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights; (3) the exercise or redemption of such rights in accordance with such rights plan(s); or (4) the termination or invalidation of such rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect upon settlement of a Stock Purchase Contract (including the Companys rights plan existing on the date of this Agreement), the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon such settlement, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such settlement, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Fixed Settlement Rates will be adjusted, pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(ii), at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution, to all holders of Common Stock, that is subject to such Section 5.4(a)(ii), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made: 

   

 (1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan; 

   

 (2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, 

   ##### 

  

    

director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries; 

   

 (3) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Common Equity Units are first issued; or 

   

 (4) for a change in the par value (including causing the Common Stock to have no par value). 

   

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates need be made for a transaction pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(i), Section 5.4(a)(ii), Section 5.4(a)(iii), Section 5.4(a)(iv) or Section 5.4(a)(v) if Holders of the Common Equity Units may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. 

   

 (ix) _Adjustments to VWAP to Account for Stock Dividends, Splits, Combinations or Subdivisions or Similar Events_. If, pursuant any provision of this Agreement, an average VWAP is to be measured over a period of multiple Trading Days and a stock dividend, split, combination or subdivision or other event requiring an adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(i) occurs, or becomes effective, at an time during such period, then, for purposes of calculating such average, the VWAP per share on each Trading Day in such period prior to such occurrence or effectiveness shall be multiplied by the reciprocal of the Adjustment Factor applicable to such stock dividend, split, combination or subdivision or other event. 

  

 (b) _Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event_. If, after the date of this Agreement, (1) there occurs (A) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person; (B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (C) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person or any binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or a reorganization effected solely to change the Companys jurisdiction of organization); or (D) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event in clauses (A) through (D), inclusive, a "Reorganization Event"); and (2) pursuant to such Reorganization Event, the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for, or constitutes solely the right to receive, cash, securities or other property, then, at and after the effective time of such Reorganization Event, the obligation of the Company to deliver, and the obligation of each Holder to purchase, each share of Common Stock upon settlement of each Stock Purchase Contract on each Stock Purchase Date shall be changed to the obligation of the Company to deliver, and the obligation of each Holder to purchase, the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property (collectively, "Reference Property") (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date) receivable pursuant to such Reorganization Event by a holder (the "Representative Holder") of one (1) share of Common Stock who (A) is not a 

   ##### 

  

 

Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or
which merged into the Company or to which such sale, transfer, lease or
conveyance was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent
Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, to the extent such
Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by
Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (B) failed to exercise his
rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of such Reference
Property ( _provided_ that if the kind or amount of such Reference Property
is not the same for each share of Common Stock held by a Person (other than
a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof) who has not exercised such
rights of election ("Non-Electing Share"), then for the purpose of this
Section 5.4(b), the kind and amount of Reference Property in respect of each
Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kinds
and amounts of Reference Property receivable per share of Common Stock
pursuant to such Reorganization Event in respect of all Non-Electing Shares).
After such Reorganization Event, the Applicable Market Value shall be
measured based on the value of a unit of Reference Property (a "Reference
Property Unit") receivable pursuant to such Reorganization Event by a
Representative Holder of one (1) share of Common Stock. Following a
Reorganization Event, references herein to the purchase or delivery of shares
of Common Stock pursuant to Stock Purchase Contracts shall be construed to be
references to the purchase or delivery of Reference Property, and references
to the purchase or delivery of a specified number of shares of Common Stock
upon settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts shall be construed to be
references to the purchase and delivery of the same number of Reference
Property Units. 

   

 In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Common Equity Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.4(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.4. This Section 5.4(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. 

  

 (c) _Successive Adjustments_. After an adjustment to a Fixed Settlement Rate under this Section 5.4, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 5.4 shall cause an adjustment to such Fixed Settlement Rate as so adjusted. 

  

 (d) _Multiple Adjustments_. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to a Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.4 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 5.5 _Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events_. 

  

 (a) Whenever a Fixed Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.4(a), the Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the occurrence of the event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) (or, in the case of a Spin-off, within ten (10) Business Days after the last Trading Day in the Spin-off Valuation Period): 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) compute the adjusted applicable Fixed Settlement Rates in accordance with Section 5.4 and prepare and transmit to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the Fixed Settlement Rates, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and 

   

 (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Common Equity Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates was determined and setting forth the adjusted Fixed Settlement Rates. 

  

 (b) The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Common Equity Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Fixed Settlement Rates or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Stock Purchase Contract; and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article V. 

  

 SECTION 5.6 _Termination Event; Notice_. If a Termination Event occurs, then, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder: 

  

 (a) the Stock Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Payments), and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock on each Stock Purchase Date occurring after such Termination Event, shall immediately and automatically terminate; 

  

 (b) each Common Equity Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities (or, if such Termination Event occurs after a Remarketing Settlement Date and before the related Stock Purchase Date, the Proceeds of such Debt Securities) or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming part of such Common Equity Unit, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, and, upon such receipt, shall be cancelled; and 

  

 (c) the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of such Termination Event, give written notice of such Termination Event to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 5.7 _Early Settlement_. 

  

 (a) Stock Purchase Contracts underlying Common Equity Units may be settled early ("Early Settlement") at the option of the Holder thereof in accordance with, and subject to, this Section 5.7; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holders of Common Equity Units may effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.7 only in integral multiples of forty (40) Common Equity Units; _provided further_  that upon an Early Settlement of a Common Equity Unit, such Early Settlement shall apply to each remaining Stock Purchase Contract of such Common Equity Unit whose Stock Purchase Date has not occurred before the applicable Early Settlement Date; _provided further_ that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.7 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a registration statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a registration statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) have in effect such a registration statement covering the settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts being settled and (ii) provide a prospectus in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event may a Holder elect an Early Settlement from the time any Remarketing has priced to, and including, the Stock Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing. 

  

 (b) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to Stock Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the Common Equity Units of which such Stock Purchase Contracts are a part shall, at any time other than the periods beginning from 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately preceding each scheduled Stock Purchase Date and ending on the open of business on the Business Day immediately following such scheduled Stock Purchase Date, deliver such Certificate to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the "Election to Settle Early" form on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to the sum of: 

   

 (i) the product of (A) the Stated Amount of each Common Equity Unit to be subject to such Early Settlement; and (B) the number of such Common Equity Units to be subject to such Early Settlement; and 

   

 (ii) if the Early Settlement Date for such Early Settlement occurs after any Record Date and before the next Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts. 

  

 If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Stock Purchase Contracts subject to an Early Settlement by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, then such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts and the related Common Equity Units, and, if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Early Settlement Date with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts and Common Equity Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Upon the receipt of such Certificate or information, as applicable, and Early Settlement Amount from the Holder, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall pay to the Company such Early Settlement Amount, the receipt of which payment the Company shall confirm in writing. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall then, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, notify the Collateral Agent that (A) such Holder has elected to effect an Early Settlement, which notice shall set forth the number of such Stock Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement and (B) the Stock Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount. 

   

 Except as provided in Section 5.11(e), upon Early Settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Payments) with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts shall immediately and automatically terminate. 

   

 (c) Upon Early Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Common Equity Units, the Company shall deliver, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, after payment of the applicable Early Settlement Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate. 

  

 (d) No later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date of a Common Equity Unit, the Company shall cause: 

   

 (i) the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.9, to be delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof (or its designee); and 

   

 (ii) the Pledged Preferred Securities, Pledged Debt Securities or Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, forming part of such Common Equity Unit to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent, free and clear of the Companys security interest therein, and transferred to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. 

  

 (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts forming part of a Common Equity Unit (and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the receipt of the related Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or Treasury Securities, as applicable, from the Securities Intermediary), the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Common Equity Units: 

   

 (i) transfer to the Holder the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or Treasury Securities, as applicable, forming a part of such Common Equity Units; 

   

 (ii) deliver to the Holder, by book-entry transfer or in the form of a certificate or certificates, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable to such Holders

share, as provided in Section 5.9, as received from the Company, and 

   

 (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a prospectus for the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon such Early Settlement, as received from the Company. 

  

 (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Stock Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Common Equity Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement, the Company shall execute, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Common Equity Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected. 

  

 (g) For avoidance of doubt, a Holder of a Common Equity Unit who effects Early Settlement may, in accordance with Section 5.2, elect to have the Debt Securities no longer a part of a Normal Common Equity Unit remarketed in any Remarketing required to be effected pursuant to such Section. 

  

 SECTION 5.8 _Early Settlement Upon Cash Merger_. 

  

 (a) If there occurs a Cash Merger before the Third Stock Purchase Date, then, at the option of the Holder thereof, Stock Purchase Contracts underlying Common Equity Units may be settled early ("Cash Merger Early Settlement") in accordance with, and subject to, this Section 5.8; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Holders of Common Equity Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.8 only in integral multiples of forty (40) Common Equity Units; _provided further_  that upon a Cash Merger Early Settlement of a Common Equity Unit, such Cash Merger Early Settlement shall apply to each remaining Stock Purchase Contract of such Common Equity Unit whose Stock Purchase Date has not occurred before the applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Date; _provided further_ that no Cash Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.8 unless, at the time such Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement, if such a registration statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a registration statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) have in effect such a registration statement covering the settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts being settled and (ii) provide a prospectus in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) Within five (5) Business Days of the completion of a Cash Merger, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Common Equity Units of the completion of such Cash Merger, which notice shall specify:

 (ii) the date by which Holders must exercise their right to effect a Cash Merger Early Settlement; 

   

 (iii) the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate for each series of Stock Purchase Contracts. 

  

 (c) If a Holder effects a Cash Merger Early Settlement of any of its Stock Purchase Contracts, then such Holder shall be entitled to receive the aggregate amount of any unpaid Contract Payments that have accrued, on such Stock Purchase Contracts, from, and including, the Payment Date immediately preceding the related Cash Merger Early Settlement Date to, but excluding, such Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, which amount shall, in accordance with Section 5.8(d), either be credited against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Cash Merger Early Settlement or, except as otherwise required by the Pledge Agreement, be paid, on such Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, to such Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Cash Merger Early Settlement Date occurs after a Record Date and on or before the next Payment Date, then the provisions of Section 5.11(e) shall apply instead of this Section 5.8(c). 

  

 (d) In order to exercise the right to effect a Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to Stock Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the Common Equity Units of which such Purchase Contracts are a part shall, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, deliver such Certificate to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the "Election to Settle Early" form on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount") equal to (I) the product of (A) the Stated Amount of each Common Equity Unit to be subject to such Cash Merger Early Settlement; and (B) the number of such Common Equity Units to be subject to such Cash Merger Early Settlement, less (II) the aggregate amount of any unpaid Contract Payments on such Stock Purchase Contracts that the Company is required to credit against such amount pursuant to Section 5.8(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Common Equity Unit is a Normal Common Equity Unit, then such Holder may, in lieu of such payment, elect (by checking the appropriate box in such "Election to Settle Early" form) to have the Pledged Preferred Securities and/or the Pledged Debt Securities forming part of such Normal Common Equity Units transferred to the Company in full satisfaction of such Holders obligation to deliver the Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount with respect to such Normal Common Equity Units (an "In Kind Settlement Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement"), in which case (A) the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall deliver such Pledged Preferred Securities or Pledged Debt Securities, duly endorsed for transfer, to the Company and (B) the Company shall, except as otherwise required by the Pledge Agreement, pay, on the applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, to such Holder the aggregate amount of any unpaid Contract Payments on such Stock Purchase Contracts that the Company is required to pay to such Holder pursuant to Section 5.8(c). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Upon the receipt of such Certificate and, unless such Certificate indicates that the Holder thereof has elected In Kind Settlement Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement to apply, the Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount from such Holder, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall pay to the Company such Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount, the receipt of which payment the Company shall confirm in writing. The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall then, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, notify the Collateral Agent that (A) such Holder has elected to effect a Cash Merger Early Settlement, which notice shall set forth the number of such Stock Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement and (B) the Stock Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount. 

   

 (e) Except as provided in Section 5.11(e), upon a Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Payments) with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts shall immediately and automatically terminate. 

  

 (f) Upon a Cash Merger Early Settlement of a Stock Purchase Contract by a Holder of the related Common Equity Unit, the Company shall deliver to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof (or its designee), upon payment of the applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Amount, a number of Reference Property Units equal to the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate. 

  

 (g) "Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate" means, with respect to a Stock Purchase Contract subject to a Cash Merger Early Settlement upon a Cash Merger, a number of Reference Property Units equal to the amount, set forth in the Series C Make-Whole Table (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series C Stock Purchase Contract), the Series D Make-Whole Table (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series D Stock Purchase Contract) or the Series E Make-Whole Table (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series E Stock Purchase Contract), which amount corresponds to the Cash Merger Effective Date and the Applicable Price of such Cash Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

   

 (i) if such Cash Merger Effective Date occurs on or after the Initial Scheduled First Stock Purchase Date (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series C Stock Purchase Contract), the Initial Scheduled Second Stock Purchase Date (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series D Stock Purchase Contract) or the Initial Scheduled Third Stock Purchase Date (if such Stock Purchase Contract is a Series E Stock Purchase Contract), then the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate for such Stock Purchase Contract shall be the Settlement Rate, calculated in accordance with Section 5.1; 

   

 (ii) if the Applicable Price of such Cash Merger is between two (2) prices listed in such Make-Whole Table in the row immediately below the title "Applicable Price," or if the Cash Merger Effective Date of such Cash Merger is between two dates listed in such Make-Whole Table under the column titled "Cash Merger Effective Date," then the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate for such Stock Purchase Contract shall be determined by linear interpolation between the settlement rates set forth for such 

   ##### 

  

    

two prices, or for such two dates based on a three hundred and sixty five
(365) or three hundred and sixty six (366) day year, as applicable; 

   

 (iii) if the Applicable Price of such Cash Merger is equal to or greater than the highest price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.8(g)(v)) listed in such Make-Whole Table in the row immediately below the title "Applicable Price," then the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate for such Stock Purchase Contract shall be the Minimum Settlement Rate; 

   

 (iv) if the Applicable Price of such Cash Merger is equal to or less than the lowest price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.8(g)(v)) listed in such Make-Whole Table in the row immediately below the title "Applicable Price," then the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate for such Stock Purchase Contract shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate; and 

   

 (v) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to Section 5.4(a), an adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is so required to be made, (A) each price set forth in such Make-Whole Table in the row immediately below the title "Applicable Price" shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Maximum Settlement Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates and whose denominator is the Maximum Settlement Rate to be in effect immediately after such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates; and (B) each settlement rate set forth in such Make-Whole Table shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such settlement rate, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such settlement rate as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such settlement rate and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Maximum Settlement Rate to be in effect immediately after such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates and whose denominator is the Maximum Settlement Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rates. 

  

 (h) No later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Date of a Common Equity Unit that is subject to Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Company shall cause: 

   

 (i) the Reference Property deliverable upon such Early Settlement, together with any payment in lieu of any fractional property, as provided in Section 5.9, to be transferred to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder of such Common Equity Unit or its designee; and

   ##### 

  

    

Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder of such Common Equity Unit
or its designee. 

  

 (i) Upon a Cash Merger Early Settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts forming part of a Common Equity Unit (and subject to the receipt of the Reference Property, and any payment in lieu of any fractional property, as provided in Section 5.9, from the Company and the receipt of the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or Treasury Securities, as applicable, from the Securities Intermediary), the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Common Equity Units: 

   

 (i) transfer to the Holder the Treasury Securities or, if In Kind Settlement Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement shall not have been duly elected to apply to such Common Equity Unit, the Pledged Preferred Securities or Pledged Debt Securities, as applicable, forming a part of such Common Equity Unit; 

   

 (ii) deliver to the Holder the Reference Property deliverable upon such Cash Merger Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fractional property, as provided in Section 5.9, as received from the Company; and 

   

 (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a prospectus for the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon such Early Settlement, as received from the Company. 

  

 (j) In the event that a Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected with respect to Stock Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Common Equity Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement, the Company shall execute, and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Common Equity Units as to which Cash Merger Early Settlement was not effected. 

  

 (k) For avoidance of doubt, a Holder of a Common Equity Unit who effects a Cash Merger Early Settlement may, in accordance with Section 5.2, elect to have the Debt Securities no longer a part of a Normal Common Equity Unit remarketed in any Remarketing required to be conducted pursuant to such Section. 

  

 SECTION 5.9 _No Fractional Shares_. 

  

 No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on any Stock Purchase Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one (1) Stock Purchase Contract shall be registered in the name of the same Holder, then the number of full shares of Common Stock that shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Stock Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates registered in the name of such Holder. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the 

   ##### 

  

 

product of the percentage of such fractional share multiplied by the VWAP per
share of Common Stock as of the Trading Day immediately preceding such Stock
Purchase Date or the related Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early
Settlement Date, as applicable. The Company shall provide the Stock Purchase
Contract Agent with sufficient funds to permit the Stock Purchase Contract
Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.9 in a timely
manner. 

   

 SECTION 5.10 _Charges and Taxes_. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Common Equity Unit or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Common Equity Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. 

  

 SECTION 5.11 _Contract Payments_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 5.11(b), Section 5.11(e) and Section 5.12, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments (net of any withholding tax required by law to be withheld by the Company on such payments, which shall be remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction) payable in respect of each Stock Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate is registered at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date. The Contract Payments will be payable at the office of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City maintained for that purpose. If the Common Equity Units are not held in the form of a Global Certificate or by the Initial Holder, then the Contract Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Persons address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent. Contract Payments payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Subject to Section 5.11(b), Section 5.11(e) and Section 5.12, Contract Payments on each Stock Purchase Contract will accrue on the Stated Amount of such Stock Purchase Contract from, and including, the most recent date to which Contract Payments on such Stock Purchase Contract have been paid or provided for (or, if no such Contract Payments have been paid or provided for, from, and including, the date of initial issuance of the Common Equity Units) to, but excluding, the next Payment Date. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.11(a) to the contrary, but subject to Section 5.11(e) and to the Companys right to defer Contract Payments pursuant to Section 5.12: 

   

 (i) if a Stock Purchase Date with respect to any series of Stock Purchase Contracts of the Outstanding Common Equity Units occurs on a day that (A) is not a Payment Date; and (B) is not during the period that begins on, and includes, the calendar day after a Record Date and ends on, and includes, the next succeeding Payment Date, 

   ##### 

  

    

then the Company shall make Contract Payments on such series of Stock
Purchase Contracts as if a Payment Date occurred with respect to such series
of Stock Purchase Contracts on such Stock Purchase Date and the related
Record Date occurred on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately
preceding such Stock Purchase Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may, at its option, upon notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, select
any other day as such related Record Date so long as such related Record Date
selected is more than one (1) Business Day but less than sixty (60) Business
Days prior to such Stock Purchase Date; _provided further_ that this Section
5.11(b)(i) shall not affect the Contract Payments, Purchase Dates or Record
Dates of any other series of Stock Purchase Contracts; and 

   

 (ii) if a Stock Purchase Date with respect to any series of Stock Purchase Contracts of the Outstanding Common Equity Units occurs on a day that (A) is not a Payment Date; and (B) is during the period that begins on, and includes, the calendar day after a Record Date and ends on, and includes, the next succeeding Payment Date, then the Company shall, in lieu of making Contract Payments on such series of Stock Purchase Contracts on such Payment Date, make Contract Payments on such series of Stock Purchase Contracts as if such Payment Date occurred on such Stock Purchase Date (and, for avoidance of doubt, no Contract Payments on such series of Stock Purchase Contracts shall accrue for any period from and after such Stock Purchase Date, except as provided in Section 5.12); _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.11(b)(ii) shall not affect the Contract Payments, Purchase Dates or Record Dates of any other series of Stock Purchase Contracts. 

  

 (c) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Companys obligation to pay Contract Payments on or after such Termination Event (including any accrued Contract Payments) shall cease. 

  

 (d) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Normal Common Equity Units) any other Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid Contract Payments which right was carried by the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates. 

  

 (e) In the case of any Common Equity Units with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Stock Purchase Contracts is effected and the related Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, is after any Record Date and on or before the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Payments otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, and such Contract Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Common Equity Units is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence or in Section 5.8(c), if the Purchase Contracts of a Common Equity Unit are subject to Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, Contract Payments that would otherwise be payable after the related Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, with respect to such Stock Purchase Contracts shall not be payable. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) The Companys obligations with respect to Contract Payments, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Companys obligations under any existing or future Senior Debt. 

  

 (g) In the event of (A) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, (B) any proceeding for the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, (C) any assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors, or (D) any other marshalling of the assets of the Company: 

   

 (i) all existing and future Senior Debt (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall first be paid in full before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any Holder of Common Equity Units; 

   

 (ii) any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, which would otherwise (but for these subordination provisions) be payable or deliverable in respect of the Common Equity Units shall be paid or delivered directly to the holders of existing and future Senior Debt in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders until all existing and future Senior Debt (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall have been paid in full; 

   

 (iii) after payment in full of all sums owing with respect to Senior Debt, the Holders of Common Equity Units, together with the holders of any obligations of the Company ranking on a parity with the Common Equity Units, shall be entitled to be paid from the remaining assets, if any, of the Company the amounts due and owing on account of unpaid Contract Payments and interest thereon and such other obligations before any payment or other distribution, whether in cash, property or otherwise, shall be made on account of any capital stock or any obligations of the Company ranking junior to the Companys obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts and such other obligations; and 

   

 (iv) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Common Equity Units in contravention of any of the terms of this Section 5.11(g), such payment or distribution or security shall be received in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered and transferred to, the holders of the Senior Debt at the time outstanding in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders for application to the payment of all secured and Senior Debt remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all such existing and future Senior Debt in full. In the event of the failure of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Common Equity Units to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, each holder of existing and future Senior Debt is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) For purposes of Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, with respect to such Contract Payments on the Common Equity Units to the payment of all existing and future Senior Debt which may at the time be outstanding; _provided_ that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Debt is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Debt are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. 

  

 (i) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under existing and future Senior Debt (other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation) shall not be deemed a default or event of default under this Agreement if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, or (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. 

  

 (j) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all existing and future Senior Debt, the Holders of the Common Equity Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Payments in respect of the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying the Common Equity Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Debt until all such Contract Payments owing on the Common Equity Units shall be paid in full, and, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior Debt and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Debt by virtue of Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Debt, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Debt, on the other hand. 

  

 (k) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Common Equity Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Debt and the Holders, the obligation of 

   ##### 

  

 

the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such
Contract Payments on the Common Equity Units as and when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or
shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company
other than the holders of Senior Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein
prevent the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all
remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this
Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Section 5.11(f) through (r),
of the holders of Senior Debt in respect of cash, property or securities
of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. 

   

 (l) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or Stock Purchase Contract Agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive. 

  

 (m) The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Stock Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. 

  

 (n) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Payments, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive. 

  

 (o) Each Holder of Common Equity Units, by its acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the Stock Purchase Contract Agent on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, and to have appointed the Stock Purchase Contract Agent its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes. 

  

 (p) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of 

   ##### 

  

 

moneys to or by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Common
Equity Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 5.11(f) through (r), inclusive, or any other provisions
of this Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged
with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making
of any payment of moneys to or by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, or the
taking of any other action by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, unless and
until the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice
thereof mailed or delivered to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent at its
Corporate Trust Office department from the Company, any Holder, or the holder
or representative of any Senior Debt; _provided_ that if at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such
moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent
shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided
for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and
authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for
which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to
the contrary that may be received by it within two (2) Business Days prior to
or on or after such date. 

   

 (q) The Stock Purchase Contract Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Senior Debt at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Debt, and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of any of its rights as such holder. 

  

 (r) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. 

  

 (s) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.7. 

  

 (t) With respect to the holders of existing and future Senior Debt, (i) the duties and obligations of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of existing and future Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 5.11 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Stock Purchase Contract Agent; and (iv) the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders. 

  

 SECTION 5.12 _Deferral of Contract Payments_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Third Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments (including any Deferred Contract Payments) otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer each 

   ##### 

  

 

such deferred Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding
Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the
Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Payments
to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of
the Common Equity Units, but in any event not less than one (1) Business Day
prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the
extent permitted by law, accrue interest thereon at an annual rate equal to
the applicable Contract Payment Deferral Rate (computed on the basis of a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each
succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of
Contract Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Payments, if
any, accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract
Payments"). Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be due on the
next succeeding Payment Date, except to the extent that payment thereof is
deferred pursuant to this Section 5.12. No Contract Payments may be deferred
to a date that is after the Third Stock Purchase Date, and no such deferral
period may end other than on a Payment Date or a Stock Purchase Date. If the
Stock Purchase Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination
Event, the Holders right to receive Contract Payments, if any, and any
Deferred Contract Payments on or after such Termination Event, will
terminate. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date that is prior to a Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. 

  

 (c) In the event that the Company elects or is directed by the Federal Reserve Board to defer the payment of Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Contracts, and the Deferred Contract Payments are not paid prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, then each Holder will, in respect of such deferred payments and in lieu of a cash payment therefor, receive, on such Stock Purchase Date, in the sole discretion of the Company, either (i) a number of shares of Common Stock (in addition to the shares of Common Stock otherwise due upon settlement of such Stock Purchase Contracts) equal to a fraction (A) whose numerator is the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments payable to such Holder (net of any required tax withholding on such Deferred Contract Payment, which shall be remitted to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction) and (B) whose denominator is the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding such Stock Purchase Date; or (ii) Unsecured Debentures which will (A) have a principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments, (B) mature on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Initial Scheduled Third Stock Purchase Date, (C) bear interest at an annual rate equal to the then market rate of interest for similar instruments (not to exceed ten percent (10%)), as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Company, (D) be subordinate and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future Senior Debt on the same basis as the Contract Payments, and (E) not be redeemable by the Company prior to their stated maturity. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Deferred Contract Payments on the Stock Purchase Date. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Deferred Contract Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.9. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Payments then, until the earlier of (x) the Termination Date or (y) the date on which the Deferred Contract Payments have been paid, the Company shall not (A) declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Companys Capital Stock; (B) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities issued by the Company that rank equally with or junior to the Companys junior subordinated debt securities; and (C) make any payment under any guarantee that ranks equally with junior subordinated debt securities of the Company, in each case other than: 

   

 (i) any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with (x) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, (y) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder purchase plan, or (z) the issuance of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into before the date the Company first exercises its option to defer Contract Payments; 

   

 (ii) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of capital stock of the Company, or the capital stock of one of the Companys subsidiaries, for any other class or series of capital stock of the Company, or of any class or series of the Companys indebtedness for any class or series of capital stock of the Company; 

   

 (iii) any purchase of, or payment of cash in lieu of, fractional interests in shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the securities being converted or exchanged; 

   

 (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto; and 

   

 (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal with or junior to such stock.

(FORM OF REVERSE OF NORMAL COMMON EQUITY UNIT CERTIFICATE) 

   

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of [execution date] (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and [legal name of stock purchase contract agent] (including its successors thereunder, the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), to which Stock Purchase Contract Agreement reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Normal Common Equity Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. 

  

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on each of the First Stock Purchase Date, the Second Stock Purchase Date and the Third Stock Purchase Date, at a price equal to the Purchase Price, a number of shares of Common Stock, per Stock Purchase Contract, equal to the applicable Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event, Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Stock Purchase Contract, all as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, if not paid earlier, shall be paid on the applicable Stock Purchase Date by application of payment received in respect of the principal amount with respect to any Pledged Debt Securities pursuant to the Remarketing pledged to secure the obligations under such Stock Purchase Contract of the Holder of the Normal Common Equity Units of which such Stock Purchase Contract is a part. 

  

 No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts. 

  

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall obligate the Holder of the related Normal Common Equity Units to purchase, and the Company to sell, either (i) a number shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or (ii) a number of Reference Property Units equal to the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). 

  

 In accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate may pay the purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or from the proceeds of or a Remarketing of the related Pledged Debt Securities. A Holder of a Normal Common Equity Unit who (1) does not, at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the eleventh (11th) Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Stock Purchase Date, elect, in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2010, among the Company, the Initial Holder and American International Group, Inc., to effect a Cash Settlement, (2) does not, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) 

   ##### 

  

 

Business Day prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, make an effective
Early Settlement, and (3) does not, prior to the applicable Stock Purchase
Date, duly effect a Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the applicable
purchase price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the
related Stock Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the related
Pledged Debt Securities held by the Collateral Agent in the relevant
Remarketing (or, if applicable in accordance with the applicable Certificate
of Designations and the Pledge Agreement, from the proceeds of the exercise
of such Holders Put Right upon a Final Failed Remarketing). The attempted
resale of Pledged Debt Securities will be made by the Remarketing Agent
pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement on the applicable Stock
Purchase Date. 

   

 The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Stock Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the applicable purchase price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

  

 Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Indemnification Security Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Preferred Securities and/or Pledged Debt Securities, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders in accordance therewith. 

  

 Upon the occurrence of a Successful Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement, cause the Securities Intermediary to transfer the applicable Pledged Debt Securities upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the proceeds of such Successful Remarketing in the Collateral Account. The Remarketing Agent will deduct, from such proceeds, a remarketing fee in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement. 

  

 The Normal Common Equity Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Normal Common Equity Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate will be registered and Normal Common Equity Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Security Registrar may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to ýSection 3.4, ýSection 3.6 and ýSection 8.5 of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement not involving any transfer. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for a Preferred Security or Debt Security, thereby creating Stripped Common Equity Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying a Normal Common Equity Unit remain in effect, such Normal Common Equity Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Normal Common Equity Unit in respect of the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities and 

   ##### 

  

 

Stock Purchase Contracts constituting such Normal Common Equity Unit may be
transferred and exchanged only as a Normal Common Equity Unit. 

   

 Subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Normal Common Equity Units may, at any time from and after the date of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (but not during the period that begins at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately preceding any scheduled Stock Purchase Date and ends at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such scheduled Stock Purchase Date), exchange such Normal Common Equity Units for Stripped Common Equity Units and Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Holders may make such exchange only in integral multiples of forty (40) Normal Common Equity Units. To effect such exchange, the Holder must perform the actions, and make the deliveries, set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement; _provided further_ that in no event may a Collateral Substitution be made from the time any Remarketing has priced to, and including, the Stock Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing. 

  

 Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments payable in respect of each Stock Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate evidencing such Stock Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. The Company shall have the right to defer Contract Payments in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

  

 If a Termination Event occurs, then, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder: (a) the Stock Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Payments), and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock on each Stock Purchase Date occurring after such Termination Event, shall immediately and automatically terminate; (b) each Common Equity Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming part of such Common Equity Unit, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement and, upon such receipt, shall be cancelled; and (c) the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, give written notice of such Termination Event to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. 

  

 Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Stock Purchase Contracts underlying Common Equity Units may be settled early at the Early Settlement Rate. 

  

 Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Normal Common Equity Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying such Normal Common Equity Units pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

  

 Upon registration of transfer of this Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, 

   ##### 

  

 

except as may be required by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the
Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), by the terms of the Stock Purchase
Contract Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby, and the
transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Stock Purchase
Contracts evidenced by this Normal Common Equity Unit Certificate. The
Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof,
likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this
paragraph. 

   

 Each Holder of a Common Equity Unit, by its acceptance of such Common Equity Unit will be deemed to have: (a) duly appointed the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Stock Purchase Contracts, the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact (including, without limitation, the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder); (b) irrevocably agreed to be bound by the terms and provisions of such Stock Purchase Contracts, the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement; (c) covenanted and agreed to perform its obligations under such Stock Purchase Contracts for so long as such Holder remains a Holder of a Common Equity Unit; (d) irrevocably authorized the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact and irrevocably authorized the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Indemnification Security Agreement for the limited purposes set forth therein; (e) consented to, and agreed to be bound by, the Pledge of such Holders right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Accounts, including, without limitation, the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities and the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement, and to the other Collateral under the Pledge Agreement; (f) for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, agreed to take the positions set forth in ýSection 10.7(b) of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement; and (g) irrevocably directed the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to execute the Remarketing Agreement at the direction of the Company, without the receipt of any opinion or certificate. 

  

 Subject to the exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority in number of the outstanding Common Equity Units. 

  

 The Stock Purchase Contracts and Common Equity Units shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. 

  

 Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner of the Common Equity Units evidenced hereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution on the Preferred Securities or Debt Securities, as applicable, payment of Contract Payments and performance of the Stock Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Common Equity Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary; and none of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

   ##### 

  

  

 No Stock Purchase Contract shall, prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under such Stock Purchase Contract, entitle the Holder of a Common Equity Unit to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent to or receive notice as a stockholder in respect of the meetings of stockholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a holder of Common Stock of the Company. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during any time when any Debt Security that forms part of the Normal Common Equity Units is a Unit Debt Security, (a) no Holder of Normal Common Equity Units shall be entitled to elect Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Early Settlement Upon Cash Merger unless the principal amount of each tranche of Component Debt Securities forming part of the Normal Common Equity Units subject to such election or substitution is an integral multiple of one thousand dollars ($1,000); and no Holder of Normal Common Equity Units shall be entitled to effect a Collateral Substitution with respect to and Common Equity Units unless the principal amount of each tranche of Component Debt Securities forming part of the Common Equity Units submitted for, or created by, such Collateral Substitution is an integral multiple of one thousand dollars ($1,000). 

  

 A copy of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the Corporate Trust Office.

 Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement, the Treasury Securities constituting part of each Stripped Common Equity Unit evidenced hereby have been pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligations of the Holder under the Stock Purchase Contracts comprising part of such Stripped Common Equity Units. 

  

 The Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement provide that all distributions with respect to the principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities shall be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement, in full satisfaction of the respective obligations of the Holders of the Stripped Common Equity Units of which such Pledged Treasury Securities are a part under the Stock Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Stripped Common Equity Units. 

  

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on each of the First Stock Purchase Date, the Second Stock Purchase Date and the Third Stock Purchase Date, at a price equal to twenty five dollars ($25.00) (the "Purchase Price"), a number shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company, per Purchase Contract, equal to the applicable Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Stock Purchase Contract, all as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, if not paid earlier, shall be paid on the applicable Stock Purchase Date by application of payment received in respect of the principal amount with respect to any Pledged Treasury Securities pledged to secure the obligations under such Stock Purchase Contract of the Holder of the Stripped Common Equity Units of which such Stock Purchase Contract is a part.

Agreement]; (iii) the Debt Securities as indebtedness; (iv) the fair market

The Contract Payments will be payable at the office of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City maintained for that purpose. If the Common Equity Units are not held in the form of a Global Certificate, the Contract Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Persons address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent. If any date on which Contract Payments are to be made is not a Business Day, then payment of the Contract Payments payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest in respect of such delay).

(FORM OF REVERSE OF STRIPPED COMMON EQUITY UNIT CERTIFICATE) 

   

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of [execution date] (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Stock Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and [legal name of stock purchase contract agent] (including its successors thereunder, the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), to which Stock Purchase Contract Agreement reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. 

  

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on each of the First Stock Purchase Date, the Second Stock Purchase Date and the Third Stock Purchase Date, at a price equal to the Purchase Price, a number of shares of Common Stock, per Stock Purchase Contract, equal to the applicable Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event, Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Stock Purchase Contract, all as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, if not paid earlier, shall be paid on the applicable Stock Purchase Date by application of payment received in respect of the principal amount with respect to the Pledged Treasury Securities pledged to secure the obligations under such Stock Purchase Contract of the Holder of the Stripped Common Equity Units of which such Stock Purchase Contract is a part. 

  

 No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of any Stock Purchase Contracts. 

  

 Each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall obligate the Holder of the related Stripped Common Equity Units to purchase, and the Company to sell, either (i) a number shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or (ii) a number of Reference Property Units equal to the Applicable Cash Merger Early Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). 

  

 In accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate may pay the purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Stock Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the principal amount of the related Pledged Treasury Securities. A Holder of a Stripped Common Equity Unit who (1) does not, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, make an effective Early Settlement and (2) does not, prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, duly effect a Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the applicable purchase price for the shares of Common 

   ##### 

  

 

Stock to be delivered under the related Stock Purchase Contract from the
proceeds of the maturity of the related Pledged Treasury Securities held by
the Collateral Agent. 

   

 The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Stock Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the applicable purchase price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

  

 The Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Common Equity Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate will be registered and Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Security Registrar may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 3.6 and Section 8.5 of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement not involving any transfer. A Holder who elects to substitute a Preferred Security or Debt Security for a Treasury Security, thereby creating Normal Common Equity Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying a Stripped Common Equity Unit remain in effect, such Stripped Common Equity Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Common Equity Unit in respect of the Treasury Securities and Stock Purchase Contracts constituting such Stripped Common Equity Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Stripped Common Equity Unit. 

  

 Subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Stripped Common Equity Units may, at any time from and after the date of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement (but not during the period that begins at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately preceding any scheduled Stock Purchase Date and ends at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such scheduled Stock Purchase Date), exchange such Stripped Common Equity Units for Normal Common Equity Units and Treasury Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holders may make such exchange only in integral multiples of forty (40) Stripped Common Equity Units. To effect such exchange, the Holder must perform the actions, and make the deliveries, set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement; _provided further_ that in no event may a Collateral Substitution be made from the time any Remarketing has priced to, and including, the Stock Purchase Date relating to such Remarketing. 

  

 Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments payable in respect of each Stock Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate evidencing such Stock Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. The Company shall have the right to defer Contract Payments in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 If a Termination Event occurs, then, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder: (a) the Stock Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Payments), and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock on each Stock Purchase Date occurring after such Termination Event, shall immediately and automatically terminate; (b) each Common Equity Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, forming part of such Common Equity Unit, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement and, upon such receipt, shall be cancelled; and (c) the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, give written notice of such Termination Event to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. 

  

 Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Stock Purchase Contracts underlying Common Equity Units may be settled early at the Early Settlement Rate. 

  

 Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Stripped Common Equity Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying such Stripped Common Equity Units pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. 

  

 Upon registration of transfer of this Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), by the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby, and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Stripped Common Equity Unit Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. 

  

 Each Holder of a Common Equity Unit, by its acceptance of such Common Equity Unit will be deemed to have: (a) duly appointed the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Stock Purchase Contracts, the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact (including, without limitation, the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder); (b) irrevocably agreed to be bound by the terms and provisions of such Stock Purchase Contracts, the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement; (c) covenanted and agreed to perform its obligations under such Stock Purchase Contracts for so long as such Holder remains a Holder of a Common Equity Unit; (d) irrevocably authorized the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact and irrevocably authorized the Stock Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Indemnification Security Agreement for the limited purposes set forth therein; (e) consented to, and agreed to be bound by, the Pledge of such Holders right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Accounts, including, without limitation, the Preferred Securities, Debt Securities and the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and the Indemnification Security Agreement, and to the other Collateral under the Pledge Agreement; (f) 

   ##### 

  

 

for U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, agreed to
take the positions set forth in ýSection 10.7(b) of the Stock Purchase
Contract Agreement; and (g) irrevocably directed the Stock Purchase Contract
Agent to execute the Remarketing Agreement at the direction of the Company,
without the receipt of any opinion or certificate. 

   

 Subject to the exceptions set forth in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority in number of the outstanding Common Equity Units. 

  

 The Stock Purchase Contracts and Common Equity Units shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. 

  

 Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner of the Common Equity Units evidenced hereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution on the Treasury Securities, payment of Contract Payments and performance of the Stock Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Common Equity Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary; and none of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company, the Security Registrar or the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

  

 No Stock Purchase Contract shall, prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under such Stock Purchase Contract, entitle the Holder of a Common Equity Unit to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent to or receive notice as a stockholder in respect of the meetings of stockholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a holder of Common Stock of the Company. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during any time when any Debt Security that forms part of the Normal Common Equity Units is a Unit Debt Security, (a) no Holder of Normal Common Equity Units shall be entitled to elect Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Early Settlement Upon Cash Merger unless the principal amount of each tranche of Component Debt Securities forming part of the Normal Common Equity Units subject to such election or substitution is an integral multiple of one thousand dollars ($1,000); and no Holder of Normal Common Equity Units shall be entitled to effect a Collateral Substitution with respect to and Common Equity Units unless the principal amount of each tranche of Component Debt Securities forming part of the Common Equity Units submitted for, or created by, such Collateral Substitution is an integral multiple of one thousand dollars ($1,000). 

  

 A copy of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the Corporate Trust Office.

forth in such paragraph; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | if the Closing Date occurs after June 14, 2011, then the

Years") from the Closing Date such that the resulting date will fall within
the period set forth in one of enumerated paragraphs 1 through 13, inclusive,
above; (2) setting each Initial Scheduled Stock Purchase Date to the date
that corresponds to a number of years equal to the Applicable Negative Number
of Years after the applicable date set forth in such paragraph.

EXHIBIT D-2 

   

MAKE-WHOLE TABLES 

  

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-2A without definition
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2010, among ALICO Holdings LLC, American
International Group, Inc. and MetLife, Inc. or the Stock Purchase Contract
Agreement, as applicable. 

  

Each of the Series C Make-Whole Table, Series D Make-Whole Table and Series E
Make-Whole Table shall be created as follows: 

   

       | A.  |   | The applicable Raw Make-Whole Table from Exhibits
D-2-I through Exhibit D-2-VII shall be determined based on the Closing Date
and the Raw Make-Whole Table Legend contained in Exhibit D-2A.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | B.  |   | Each number in the column in such Raw Make-Whole Table
titled "Time to Maturity (Years)" represents the time (expressed in years) to
(1) the Initial Scheduled First Stock Purchase Date, in the case of the
Series C Make-Whole Table; (2) the Initial Scheduled Second Stock Purchase
Date, in the case of the Series D Make-Whole Table; or (3) the Initial
Scheduled Third Stock Purchase Date, in the case of the Series E Make-Whole
Table (such applicable date specified in clause (1), (2) or (3), the
"Applicable Initial Scheduled Stock Purchase Date").  
      
    | C.  |   | Each number in the column in such Raw Make-Whole Table
titled "Time to Maturity (Years)" shall be converted into a date as
follows:  
   

  

       |   |   | if such number is zero, then such number shall be
replaced with the Applicable Initial Scheduled Stock Purchase Date; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | if such number is not zero, then such number shall be
replaced with the date that is exactly a number of calendar months before the
Applicable Initial Scheduled Stock Purchase Date that is equal to the product
of such number and twelve (12) (such product, the "Applicable Number of
Months");1 _provided_ , _however_ , that if such resulting date does not
exist, then such resulting date shall instead be the last calendar day of the
calendar month that is a number of calendar months equal to the Applicable
Number of Months before the month of the Applicable Initial Scheduled
Stock Purchase Date.2  
   

  

       | D.  |   | The cell in the resulting table that contains the
date that is closest to, but before, the Closing Date shall be replaced with
the Closing Date. After such change, each row containing a date that precedes
the Closing Date shall be deleted.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | E.  |   | The caption "Time to Maturity (Years)" in such table
shall then be renamed "Cash Merger Effective Date."  
   

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    1  |   | For example, if the Applicable Initial Scheduled Stock
Purchase Date is January 1, 2011 and such number is 0.25, then such number
shall be replaced with a date that is exactly 0.25 × 12 calendar months
before January 1, 2011 _i.e._ , 3 calendar months before January 1,
2011, which corresponds to October 1, 2010.  
   
    2  |   | For example, if the Applicable Initial Scheduled Stock
Purchase Date is May 30, 2011 and such number is 0.25, then such number shall
be replaced with a date that is exactly 0.25 × 12 calendar months before May
30, 2011 _i.e._ , 3 calendar months before May 30, 2011. However, because
February 30, 2011 does not exist, the date will instead be February 28,
2011.  
      ##### 

  

       

However, 

   

       |   |   | if the Closing Date occurs before June 15, 2010,
then the Make-Whole Tables shall be determined by (1) adding the lowest
positive whole number of years (the "Applicable Positive Number of Years") to
the Closing Date such that the resulting date (such resulting date, the
"Adjusted Positive Closing Date") will fall within the period set forth in one
of enumerated paragraphs 1 through 13, inclusive, of the Raw Make-Whole Table
Legend contained in Exhibit D-2A; (2) performing the procedures set forth in
paragraphs A through E, inclusive, above, substituting the Adjusted Positive
Closing Date for the Closing Date; and (3) amending each date appearing in
the column titled "Cash Merger Effective Date" in each such resulting table
by subtracting, from such date, a number of years equal to the Applicable
Positive Number of Years; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | if the Closing Date occurs after June 14, 2011, then the
Make-Whole Tables shall be determined by (1) subtracting the lowest positive
whole number of years (the "Applicable Negative Number of Years") from the
Closing Date such that the resulting date (such resulting date, the "Adjusted
Negative Closing Date") will fall within the period set forth in one of
enumerated paragraphs 1 through 13, inclusive, of the Raw Make-Whole Table
Legend contained in Exhibit D-2A; (2) performing the procedures set forth in
paragraphs A through E, inclusive, above, substituting the Adjusted Negative
Closing Date for the Closing Date; and (3) amending each date appearing in
the column titled "Cash Merger Effective Date" in each such resulting table
by adding, to such date, a number of years equal to the Applicable Negative
Number of Years.

If as of the last day of the extension period described in _Section 2.7.2_ above with respect to a Long-Dated Protected Asset, (a) the Stated Maturity Date of such Long-Dated Protected Asset has not already terminated and (b) there exists an uncured Protected Asset Payment Default with respect to such Long-Dated Protected Asset, then, so long as the Unrecovered Amount exceeds the Deductible, the Seller shall pay to the Company, in full satisfaction of its obligations to make Protection Payments with respect to such Long-Dated Protected Asset, an amount (the " _Termination Payment_ ") equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (A) the Carrying Value of such Long-Dated Protected Asset as of the date of such payment  _plus_ (B) all 

      ##### 

  

    

accrued but unpaid interest (excluding Additional Interest) on such Long-Dated
Protected Asset as of the date of such payment _less_ (ii) the sum of (A) all
Unrecovered Protection Payments in respect of such Long-Dated Protected Asset
as of the date of such payment _plus_ (B) the total amount of Defaulted
Payment Amounts for such Long-Dated Protected Asset that were applied against
the Deductible. As an alternative to making the Termination Payment with
respect to any Long-Dated Protected Asset pursuant to this _Section 2.7.3_,
the Seller may elect, but only with the prior written consent of the Company,
to extend the Protection Period for such Long-Dated Protected Asset to the
Stated Maturity Date of such Long-Dated Protected Asset. 

   

 2.8. _Interest on Protection Payments_. Interest on each Protection Payment shall accrue on the outstanding amount thereof commencing on the date such Protection Payment is made through the last day of the month immediately preceding the date such Protection Payment is repaid with Recoveries pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such interest shall only be payable by the Company and the Acquiror on such Protection Payments to the extent the Company or the Acquiror receives Recoveries in an amount sufficient to pay such interest pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof. Interest on Protection Payments shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall compound quarterly. Each Protection Payment shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Protection Payment Interest Rate in effect from time to time. 

  

 2.9. _Currency_. Any Protection Payment required hereunder shall be paid by the Seller to the Company in the currency under the Existing Loan Documents for the Protected Asset to which such Protection Payment relates. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

RECOVERIES 

  

 3.1. _Maximize Recoveries_. The parties hereto recognize and agree that it is in their mutual interest that the Acquiror and the Company be permitted to use, and the Acquiror and the Company hereby agree that they intend to use, commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the occurrence of any Protected Asset Payment Defaults, minimize the amount of any Defaulted Payment Amounts and maximize Recoveries with respect to the Protected Assets. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and the Company, on the other, agree that each shall be fully protected in exercising its rights under this Agreement, and the Acquiror and the Company shall be fully protected in their dealings as owners of the Protected Assets without liability to the Seller or the Parent for failure or alleged failure to minimize the occurrence of any Protected Asset Payment Defaults, failure or alleged failure to minimize the amount of Defaulted Payment Amounts or failure or alleged failure to maximize Recoveries; nor shall any such failure or alleged failure constitute a defense or excuse to full and timely payment and performance by the Seller of its obligations hereunder. In addition, no failure or deemed failure to deliver information, 

   ##### 

  

 

audits, approvals, reports or any other data hereunder, or failure to resolve
a dispute, including pursuant to _Section 2.5.8_, shall constitute a defense
to any of the Sellers obligations hereunder, including, without limitation,
the Sellers obligations to make Protection Payments. 

   

 3.2. _Interest on Expenses_. Interest on any third-party, out-of-pocket cost, fee, charge or expense incurred, or any capital investment made, by the Company or the Acquiror after the Effective Date in connection with realizing a Recovery, shall accrue on the outstanding amount thereof commencing on the date such cost, fee, charge or expense was paid or such investment was made by the Company through the last day of the month immediately preceding the date such expense is repaid or such investment is returned with Recoveries. Interest on each such expense or investment shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and shall compound quarterly. Each such expense or investment shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Capital Investment Interest Rate in effect from time to time. In no event shall the Seller be required to make any payment to the Company or the Acquiror in respect of the interest described in this _Section 3.2_. 

  

 3.3. _Payment of Recoveries_. To the extent that the Company or the Acquiror receives any Recovery, the Company and the Acquiror agree to apply the amount of such Recovery as follows: 

  

 3.3.1. _first_ , to pay fifty percent (50%) to the Company and fifty percent (50%) to the Seller until such time as the amount of the Unrecovered Protection Payments has been reduced to zero and all accrued but unpaid interest on all Unrecovered Protection Payments payable pursuant to  _Section 2.8_ above has been paid in full; 

   

 3.3.2. _second_ , to the extent all or any portion of such amount is remaining after the foregoing application and to the extent the Unrecovered Amount is greater than zero (after giving effect to the application of the amount of such Recovery pursuant to _Section 3.3.1_ above), to pay to the Company until such time as the Unrecovered Amount has been reduced to zero; and 

   

 3.3.3. _third_ , to the extent all or any portion of such amount is remaining after the foregoing applications, to pay to the Company. 

   

 3.4. _Application of Recoveries_. In the event that a Recovery is received by the Seller in respect of a Protected Asset on which Protection Payments have been made, such Recovery shall be applied first to the Protected Asset on which such Recovery was made until such time as the amount of Unrecovered Protection Payments in respect of such Protected Asset has been reduced to zero and then to all other Protected Assets on which Protection Payments have been made on a  _pro_ _rata_ basis in accordance with the relative Unrecovered Protection Payments made in respect of such other Protected Assets. In the event that a Recovery is made in respect of a Protected Asset on which no Protection Payments have been made as a result of the Unrecovered Amount not 

   ##### 

  

 

exceeding the Deductible, such Recovery shall be applied to all Protected
Assets on which Protection Payments have been made on a _pro_ _rata_ basis in
accordance with the relative Unrecovered Protection Payments made in respect
of such Protected Assets. 

   

 3.5. _Currency._ Any payment of a Recovery required hereunder shall be paid by the Company and the Acquiror to the Seller in the currency under the Existing Loan Documents for the Protected Asset to which such Recovery relates. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

PURCHASE OPTION 

  

 4.1. _Purchase Option_. The Seller shall have the right to purchase any Protected Asset at its discretion at any time during the Protection Period for such Protected Asset by providing the Company and the Acquiror written notice thereof (each, a " _Purchase Notice_ "), which Purchase Notice shall (a) identify the Protected Asset subject to the Purchase Notice and (b) specify the date on which the purchase of the Protected Asset shall occur (the " _Purchase Date_ "), which shall be no earlier than ten (10) days, and no later than ninety (90) days, following the date of such Purchase Notice. 

  

 4.2. _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for any Protected Asset that is the subject of a Purchase Notice shall be an amount (the " _Purchase Price_ ") equal to (a) the Carrying Value of such Protected Asset as of such Purchase Date _plus_ (b) all accrued but unpaid interest on such Protected Asset as of such Purchase Date at the interest rate (excluding any Additional Interest) set forth in the Existing Loan Documents for such Protected Asset. 

  

 4.3. _Closing_. On the Purchase Date with respect to any Protected Asset, the Seller shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Purchase Price, and the Company shall assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such Protected Asset, without recourse or warranty, except warranties from the Company and the Acquiror that the Company is the legal and beneficial owner of the Protected Asset being sold and that the Company owns, and is transferring to the Seller, such Protected Asset free and clear of all claims, liens or encumbrances, except such liens or encumbrances as to which such Protected Asset was subject on the Effective Date. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

SALES OF PROTECTED ASSETS 

  

 5.1. _Last Look_. In the event that at any time during the Protection Period for any Protected Asset, the Company or the Acquiror receives a bona fide offer to purchase such Protected Asset (the " _Subject Protected Asset_ ") from any Person (the " _Purchaser_ "), the Company and the Acquiror shall not consummate such sale before first providing the Seller with a right to purchase the Subject Protected Asset for the same price and on the 

      ##### 

  

    

same terms and conditions set forth in such bona fide offer (the " _Purchase
Option_ "), on and subject to the following terms and conditions: 

   

 5.1.1. The Company and the Acquiror shall give written notice (the " _Last Look Notice_ ") to the Seller setting forth the identity of the Purchaser, the proposed purchase price set forth in the bona fide offer from the Purchaser (the " _Proposed Purchase Price_ ") and all other material terms and conditions set forth in such bona fide offer and offering to sell the Subject Protected Asset to the Seller on the same terms as those made available to the Purchaser. 

   

 5.1.2. The Seller shall have ten (10) days (the " _Acceptance Period_ ") after the delivery by the Company and the Acquiror to the Seller of the Last Look Notice to elect to exercise the Purchase Option with respect to the Subject Protected Asset (such election to be made, if at all, by giving written notice thereof (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") to the Company and the Acquiror within the Acceptance Period). 

   

 5.1.3. If the Seller fails to exercise the Purchase Option within the Acceptance Period, then the Company shall have the right to sell the Subject Protected Asset to such Purchaser at any time or times during the 60-day period following the expiration of the Acceptance Period (such period, the " _Closing Period_ "), for aggregate cash consideration which is not less than 98% of the Proposed Purchase Price and is otherwise on terms that are not materially more favorable to the Purchaser than those set forth in the Last Look Notice. If the closing of such sale does not occur within such 60-day period, the Purchase Option will again apply as to any sale of the Protected Asset occurring after such 30-day period. 

   

 5.1.4. If the Seller exercises the Purchase Option within the Acceptance Period, then such exercise shall be deemed to create a contract between each of the Seller, on the one hand, and the Company and the Acquiror, on the other, pursuant to which the Seller irrevocably agrees to acquire, and the Company irrevocably agrees to sell, the Subject Protected Asset for the Proposed Purchase Price and on the other terms set forth in the Last Look Notice and the closing date for such sale shall be on the thirtieth (30th) day after the exercise by the Seller of the Purchase Option (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day) or such earlier date as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto. On the relevant closing date, the Seller shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Proposed Purchase Price, and the Company shall assign all of its right, title and interest in and to such Subject Protected Asset, without recourse or warranty, except warranties from the Company and the Acquiror that the Company is the legal and beneficial owner of the Subject Protected Asset being sold and that the Company owns, and is transferring to the Seller, such Subject Protected Asset free and clear of all claims, liens or encumbrances, except such liens or encumbrances as to which such Subject Protected Asset was subject on the Effective Date. If the sale of the Subject Protected Asset fails to occur on the relevant closing date solely by reason of a default by the Company or the Acquiror, then, at the election of the Seller, (a) the contract created by the Last Look Notice and the 

      ##### 

  

    

Acceptance Notice shall be terminated or (b) the Seller may seek specific
performance of such contract, but the Seller shall have no other rights or
remedies by reason of such breach. 

   

 5.2. _No Liability for Sales of Protected Assets without Consent_. 

  

 5.2.1. If any Protected Asset is sold by the Company (including any sale to the Seller pursuant to _Article IV_ or _Section 5.1_ above), whether such sale occurs during the Protection Period with respect to such Protected Asset or thereafter, the Seller will not incur any liability or be liable to make any Protection Payments with respect to any losses realized by the Company in respect of such sale, except to the extent provided in _Section 5.2.2_ and  _Section 5.2.3_ hereof, and the Seller shall not be entitled to share in any gains realized by the Company in respect of such sale, except to the extent the proceeds of such sale constitute Recoveries payable to the Seller pursuant to _Section 3.3_ hereof. 

   

 5.2.2. If the Company wishes to sell any Protected Asset during the Protection Period for such Protected Asset and the gross sales proceeds from such sale are less than ninety percent (90%) of the Carrying Value of such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale _plus_ all accrued but unpaid interest on such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale, then to the extent that the Unrecovered Amount exceeds the Deductible and so long as the Seller consents to such sale, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Seller shall make a payment to the Company, pursuant to _Section 2.6.1_ hereof, in an amount (the " _Top-Up Payment_ ") equal to (a) fifty percent (50%) of the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of (A) the Carrying Value of such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale _plus_ (B) all accrued and unpaid interest on such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale _over_ (ii) the gross sales proceeds received by the Company from such sale _less_ (b) the Unrecovered Protection Payments made with respect to such Protected Asset as of such date. In the event the Company wishes to sell any Protected Asset during the Protection Period for such Protected Asset and the gross sales proceeds from such sale are less than ninety percent (90%) of the Carrying Value of such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale _plus_ all accrued but unpaid interest on such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale, the Company may request the consent of the Seller to such sale by delivering to the Seller a description of the proposed sale, including all material terms of such sale to permit the Seller to make a decision in its commercially reasonable discretion. If the Seller fails to respond to a request for consent within ten (10) Business Days following the Companys request therefor, the Company may deliver a second request for the Sellers consent to such matter, which request will include a warning that the Sellers failure to grant or deny the requested consent within three (3) Business Days of the Sellers receipt thereof will result in the requested consent being deemed to have been granted. If the Seller fails to respond to such second request within three (3) Business Days of its receipt thereof, the Sellers consent to the matter described in such second request shall be deemed to have been granted. For the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Seller shall not be required for any sale of a Protected Asset so 

      ##### 

  

    

long as after giving effect to such sale, the Unrecovered Amount does not
exceed the Deductible. 

   

 5.2.3. If the Company sells any Protected Asset during the Protection Period for such Protected Asset and the gross sales proceeds from such sale are greater than or equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Carrying Value of such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale  _plus_ all accrued but unpaid interest on such Protected Asset as of the date of such sale, then so long as the Unrecovered Amount exceeds the Deductible, the Seller shall make a payment to the Company, pursuant to _Section 2.6.1_ hereof, in an amount equal to the Top-Up Payment in respect of such sale, as calculated pursuant to _Section 5.2.2_ above as of the date of such sale. 

   

 5.3. _Sales to Affiliates of the Acquiror_. The provisions of this Agreement regarding sales of Protected Assets (including the provisions of _Article IV_ and _Article V_ hereof) shall not apply to sales of Protected Assets to an Affiliate of the Acquiror (any such Affiliate, an " _Affiliate Transferee_ ") so long as such Affiliate Transferee agrees in writing to become a party to this Agreement and to be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Company and the Acquiror under this Agreement, but only in so far as they relate to the Protected Asset transferred to that Affiliate. 

  

 5.4. _Participations, etc_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) all references herein to the sale of a Protected Asset shall be deemed to include the sale of a participation interest in such Protected Asset and (b) all references herein to the purchase of a Protected Asset shall be deemed to include the purchase of a participation interest in such Protected Asset.

 6.2. _Appraisals_. 

  

 6.2.1. _Copies of Appraisals_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Company or the Acquiror to deliver copies of appraisals and assessments pursuant to this  _Section 6.2.1_ 

      ##### 

  

    

shall not constitute a defense to any of the Sellers obligations hereunder,
including, without limitation, the Sellers obligations to make Protection
Payments. 

   

 6.2.2. _Cooperation with Appraisals_. Subject to all applicable confidentiality requirements under the Loan Documents or applicable law, the Seller may from time to time, upon written notice to the Company and the Acquiror, engage an appraiser to conduct an appraisal of one or more of the properties that secure the Protected Assets. The Company and the Acquiror hereby agree to cooperate with the Seller and its appraiser with respect to any such appraisal, including by providing the Seller and its appraiser with access to the property or properties being appraised to the extent permitted under the Loan Documents for the relevant Protected Asset and by requesting the Obligors under the Loan Documents for the relevant Protected Asset to provide the Seller and its appraiser with access to the property or properties being appraised. 

   

 6.3. _Monthly Reports_. As part of its Monthly Payment Report, the Company and the Acquiror shall deliver to the Seller, at the addresses set forth in _Section 7.6_, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the last day of each calendar month, a delinquency and a watch-list report regarding the Protected Assets. 

  

 6.4. _Further Information; Audits_. The Company and the Acquiror shall also, promptly following request therefor, provide to the Seller any other information reasonably requested by the Seller and available to the Acquiror or the Company without unreasonable expense (except to the extent the Seller agrees to reimburse the Company or the Acquiror, as applicable, for such expense) with respect to the Protected Assets or the Underlying Collateral, subject to all applicable confidentiality requirements of the Acquiror and the Company pursuant to the Loan Documents for such Protected Assets and under applicable law, which information may include, without limitation, (a) financial statements of the Obligors for the Protected Assets that are in the possession of the Company or the Acquiror, (b) full and complete copies of the Loan Documents evidencing or relating to the Protected Assets and any reports, certificates or notices delivered pursuant to or in connection with such Loan Documents; and (c) any other credit information in the possession of the Company or the Acquiror with respect to the Obligors or the Underlying Collateral for the Protected Assets. In addition, the Seller shall have the right from time to time, at its own expense, to perform an audit of the Protected Assets and to inspect the books and records of the Company and the Acquiror solely with respect to the Protected Assets.

 SECTION 2.6 _Secured Party and Pledge Collateral Agent Appointed Attorneys-in-Fact_. Pledgor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Secured Party, Pledge Collateral Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Pledgor or in Secured Partys or Pledge Collateral Agents own name (but for the benefit of Secured Party and the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties), for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments that may be necessary or useful to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, taking any action which may be necessary in any applicable jurisdiction to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of Secured Partys interest in the Indemnification Account and the Indemnification Collateral and Pledge Collateral Agents security interest (for the benefit of Secured Party and the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) in the Pledge Collateral and the Pledge Collateral Accounts, including, without limitation, the filing of any financing and continuation statements in any applicable jurisdiction and to take any action and to execute any instrument, representing any dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same as Secured Party or Pledge Collateral Agent (for the benefit of Secured Party and the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement. To the extent permitted by law, Pledgor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

   ##### 

  

 

Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent to the IRS, or any other relevant Tax
Authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income
and gain earned by the Pledgor, and Pledgor shall duly pay any Taxes

against any and all Taxes relating to the Eligible Collateral,
Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral, including all Taxes
imposed on a Secured Party to the extent that the Secured Party is required
by applicable Tax Law (including section 468B of the Code and any temporary
or final regulations issued thereunder) to include any Includible Amounts in
the Secured Partys gross income for federal, state, local or other Tax

Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights, if any, pertaining to the Indemnification Collateral, the Pledge Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose, subject to the limitations set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 2.9 _Ability to Enforce Collateral_. 

  

 In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnification Provisions and the Ancillary Agreements, from time to time, Secured Party may determine that it or any of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties is owed an amount in respect of the Obligations, which amount may be equal in value to all or any part of the amount to the credit of the Indemnification Account. In such event, which may occur multiple times as provided in the agreements or provisions constituting the Obligations, Secured Party is entitled in accordance with the Indemnification Provisions to make a demand upon Pledgor for, or otherwise receive, payment for such Obligations (for its own benefit or the benefit of the other applicable Acquiror Indemnified Parties). Pursuant to Section 11.05(a) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Pledgor may in some instances satisfy such demand by delivering Eligible Collateral that is credited to the Indemnification Account with a Fair Value equal to the amount demanded. Upon receipt from Pledgor of a request complying with the requirements of such Section 11.05(a) that some or all of the amount demanded be paid using Eligible Collateral constituting Indemnification Collateral, Secured Party agrees to instruct Securities Intermediary to debit the requested number of Common Equity Units or shares of Common Stock or Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock and/or withdraw the requested amount of cash from the Indemnification Account and transfer such Common Equity Units, Common Stock, Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock and/or cash to such account as Secured Party may designate in payment of Obligations with a Fair Value represented by such transferred Common Equity Units, Common Stock, Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock and/or cash. The failure of Pledgor to satisfy such demand or make such payment in full (in either case, regardless of whether such demand is permitted by the Indemnification Provisions to be satisfied by Pledgor prior to default by delivering a request to Secured Party in the manner described above that Secured Party debit Eligible Collateral from the Indemnification Account), , after compliance by Secured Party with the terms of the applicable provisions or agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

constituting the relevant Obligations and the terms of the Indemnification
Provisions, including, without limitation, any terms relating to the
resolution of disagreements regarding the amount or existence of any
indemnification or other Obligation, shall constitute a default hereunder. It
shall also constitute a default hereunder if, in the case of any payment
required to be made under Article II, Section 6.12, Sections
11.02(a)(vii),(viii) or (ix) of the Stock Purchase Agreement or the non-
indemnification provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, or pursuant to
the Special Asset Protection Agreement, the Pledgor and Pledgor Parent shall
fail to make such payment in full in accordance with Sections 6.24 and
11.05(a)(i) and (ii). Upon the occurrence of a default for any of the reasons
set forth above, Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Indemnification
Collateral, and Pledge Collateral Agent may, for the benefit of Secured
Party (whether for Secured Partys benefit or for the benefit of other
Acquiror Indemnified Parties) and upon the instructions of Secured Party,
exercise in respect of the Pledge Collateral (subject to the last sentence of
Section 2.2), in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein
or in Section 11.05(a) of the Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise available
to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the
UCC, or under other applicable law, with respect to such portions of the
Indemnification Collateral having in the aggregate a value equal to the
amount of the Obligations then due to Secured Party but unpaid (the "Unpaid
Obligation Amount"), such value to equal, to the extent Eligible Collateral
is applied, the Fair Value of such Eligible Collateral and otherwise to equal
such other amount as shall be determined in a manner consistent with
applicable law. Secured Party may also, without notice except as required by
law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any such default
direct Securities Intermediary from time to time, to the extent permitted by
law, to transfer, deliver, and pay over to Secured Party, or as Secured Party
directs, all or any part of the Indemnification Collateral and the proceeds
thereof (including, without limitation, any distributions of cash and
securities made in respect of the Indemnification Collateral, including
Pledge Collateral to the extent it relates to Pledged Units being applied to
the payment of any Unpaid Obligation Amount) in an amount up to the Unpaid
Obligation Amount and apply any cash received from Securities Intermediary to
the payment of the Obligations then due to Secured Party but unpaid, and sell
the Indemnification Collateral in an amount up to the Unpaid Obligation
Amount or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale,
at any exchange, brokers board or at any of Secured Partys or
Securities Intermediarys offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for
future delivery, and upon such other terms as Secured Party may deem
commercially reasonable, and Secured Party may instruct Pledge Collateral
Agent, as secured party for the benefit of Secured Party (for its own benefit
and the benefit of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties), to take such
action with respect to the Pledge Collateral (subject to the last sentence of
Section 2.2), including, without limitation, the transfer at the time
specified by Secured Party of any such Pledge Collateral out of any
Pledged Unit Subaccount to the appropriate other subaccount under the Pledge
Agreement, as may be necessary or desirable to effectuate the transfer or
sale of Indemnification Collateral described above;  _provided_ that the
aggregate value (calculated as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement
and herein) of the Indemnification Collateral, any such transferred Pledge
Collateral and the proceeds of the disposition thereof applied to
the payment of the Obligations at any time shall not exceed the Unpaid
Obligation Amount at such time; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Secured
Party shall not exercise, or cause Pledge Collateral Agent to exercise, any
rights with respect to the Pledge Collateral that would breach the covenant
set forth in the last sentence of Section 2.2 or that would adversely affect
the operation of the Pledge Agreement, any Stock Purchase 

      ##### 

  

    

Contract or the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement. Pledgor acknowledges that
to the extent the Indemnification Collateral credited to the Indemnification
Account or the Pledge Collateral credited to the Pledge Collateral Accounts
under the Pledge Agreement is of a type sold in a recognized market, no
notice by Secured Party to Pledgor shall be required prior to the sale of
any Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral hereunder. In the event
such notice is given, neither Secured Party nor Pledge Collateral Agent shall
be obligated to make any sale of Indemnification Collateral or Pledge
Collateral regardless of such notice having been given. Secured Party or
Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may adjourn any public or
private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and
place to which it was so adjourned. Upon any sale or transfer of any Common
Equity Units contained in the Indemnification Collateral, whether
upon Secured Partys exercise of its rights as a secured party hereunder or
upon the instructions of Pledgor in connection with a substitution of
Indemnification Collateral, the Pledge Collateral associated with such Common
Equity Units being sold shall, if such Common Equity Units shall continue to
be outstanding after such sale or other transfer, be transferred from the
Pledge Collateral Accounts to the other appropriate subaccounts with the
Collateral Agent under the Pledge Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 2.10 _Security Interest Absolute_. All rights of Secured Party and Pledge Collateral Agent for benefit of the Secured Party and the security interests granted hereunder, and all obligations of Pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any change in time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Indemnification Provisions; (ii) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations; or (iii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Pledgor in respect of the Obligations other than full and final payment thereof. 

  

 SECTION 2.11 _Further Assurances_. Pledgor, Secured Party, Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent agree that, at any time and from time to time at the expense of Pledgor, Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents and take all further action that may be necessary or desirable or that Secured Party, Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to create, perfect, and protect any pledge or security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable Secured Party to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to the Indemnification Collateral and to enable Pledge Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce for the benefit of Secured Party its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to the Pledge Collateral. If Pledgor shall fail to execute such instruments or documents or to take such further action, Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent may do so in Pledgors stead in their own names or as Pledgors attorneys-in-fact, and at Pledgors expense.

has delivered written notice to Secured Party, with a copy to Securities
Intermediary, at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the proposed date
of withdrawal detailing the Indemnification Collateral proposed to be
withdrawn; _provided_ , _further_ , that Securities Intermediary has received
a Written Instruction and/or entitlement order from Secured Party authorizing
the withdrawal of such Excess Collateral Amount; and _provided, further,_
that upon the occurrence of a Parent Bankruptcy, no Indemnification
Collateral shall be released hereunder pursuant to _Sections
11.05(c)_ except to the extent, in the manner and at the time or times
permitted thereby. Secured Party hereby agrees that it will timely deliver an

Equity Units are withdrawn from the Indemnification Account, the corresponding
Pledge Collateral shall be transferred from the Pledge Unit Subaccounts to
the appropriate other subaccounts under the Pledge Agreement. 

  

 If any Indemnification Collateral is required to remain in the Indemnification Account after the 30-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Pledgor similarly shall be entitled thereafter to withdraw any Excess Collateral Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that Pledgor has delivered written notice to Secured Party and Securities Intermediary at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the proposed date of withdrawal detailing the Indemnification Collateral proposed to be withdrawn; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that Securities Intermediary has received a Written Instruction and/or entitlement order from Secured Party authorizing the withdrawal of such Excess Collateral Amount.

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnification Collateral proposed to be withdrawn from the Indemnification
Account. Pledgor shall be entitled to effect the proposed substitution;
_provided_ , that Securities Intermediary has received a Written Instruction
and/or entitlement order from Secured Party authorizing
Securities Intermediary to effect the substitution and that, prior to such
substitution, the Pledgor shall have delivered to the Secured Party a written
opinion of outside counsel for the Pledgor, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Secured Party stating that (i) this Agreement is effective
to create a security interest in the Eligible Collateral in favor of the
Secured Party; (ii) by virtue of this Agreement, the Secured Partys security
interest in the Eligible Collateral has been perfected; and (iii) no adverse
claim to a financial asset credited to a securities account constituting part
of the Indemnification Collateral Account may be asserted against the Secured
Partys security interest in the Eligible Collateral. Secured Party hereby
agrees that it will timely deliver an appropriate entitlement order to the
Securities Intermediary adequate to permit a permitted substitution of
Indemnification Collateral; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be
required to deliver such an instruction and/or entitlement order unless the
Fair Value of the Eligible Collateral proposed to be transferred to the
Indemnification Account is at least equal to the Fair Value of the
Indemnification Collateral proposed to be withdrawn from the
Indemnification Account. If Secured Party does not intend to deliver an
instruction and/or entitlement order to Securities Intermediary authorizing a
substitution of Indemnification Collateral under the circumstances described
above Secured Party shall deliver to Pledgor a notice, not later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed date of withdrawal, providing
details of the shortfall in the Fair Value of the Eligible Collateral to be
transferred as compared to the Fair Value of the Indemnification Collateral
proposed to be withdrawn. If any substitution involves the withdrawal of
Common Equity Units from the Indemnification Account, the Pledge Collateral
corresponding to such Units shall be transferred from the Pledge Collateral
Accounts to the other appropriate subaccounts under the Pledge Agreement.
Substitutions of Pledge Collateral pursuant to the terms of Sections 5.1(c),
5.2 and 5.3 of the Pledge Agreement shall be effected in accordance with
such terms and Section 4.4(a) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pledgor
will be permitted to substitute any proceeds of a sale or transfer of
Eligible Collateral permitted under the Investor Rights Agreement following
reasonable notice to Secured Party with a copy to Securities Intermediary,
and Secured Party hereby agrees that it will timely deliver an appropriate
securities entitlement order to Securities Intermediary adequate to permit
such substitution of Indemnification Collateral. 

  

 SECTION 4.4 _Common Equity Units as Collateral._  

  

 (a) _Collateral Substitutions._ If Pledgor effects a Collateral Substitution (as such term is defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement) with respect to any Stock Purchase Contracts forming part of Common Equity Units credited to the Indemnification Account by exercising its right to do so under the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Pledge Agreement, the Normal Common Equity Units or Stripped Common Equity Units (as such terms are defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement) created pursuant to such Collateral Substitution, but not the Corporate Securities or Treasury Securities (as such terms are defined in the Pledge Agreement) released from the security interest created pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, shall, unless otherwise agreed by Secured Party, be credited to the Indemnification Account as additional Indemnification Collateral, and the Corporate Securities or Treasury Securities released from the security interest created pursuant to the Pledge 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement shall be released from the security interest created pursuant to
this Agreement and delivered to the Pledgor. Secured Party shall be entitled

 If Pledgor purchases Common Stock pursuant to Stock Purchase Contracts relating to any Common Equity Units credited to the Indemnification Account in consideration for the cash proceeds of Treasury Securities, the Common Stock so acquired shall, unless otherwise agreed by Secured Party, be credited to the Indemnification Account as additional Indemnification Collateral. Secured Party shall be entitled to retain such consideration as the purchase price for such Common Stock without there being any reduction in the Obligations as a result of such retention.

   ##### 

  

    

Account as additional Indemnification Collateral. Secured Party shall be
entitled to retain such consideration as the purchase price for such Common
Stock without there being any reduction in the Obligations as a result of
such retention, and such debt securities or U.S. Treasury Securities shall be
released from the Pledge Collateral Accounts pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement. 

  

 (e) _Termination Events._ If, pursuant to Stock Purchase Contracts relating to any Common Equity Units credited to the Indemnification Account, Pledgor takes Corporate Securities or Treasury Securities free and clear of the lien of the Pledge Agreement rather than Common Stock as a result of a Termination Event (as defined in the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement), such Corporate Securities or Treasury Securities so acquired, shall, unless otherwise agreed by Secured Party, be credited to the Indemnification Account as additional Indemnification Collateral and shall be released from the Pledge Collateral Accounts pursuant to the Pledge Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Cooperation._ So long as no default has occurred and is continuing, upon request of Pledgor to exercise any of its rights with respect to Common Equity Units credited to the Indemnification Account as set forth in Sections 4.4(a) through (d) above, Secured Party and Securities Intermediary shall cooperate with Pledgor, including by delivering any appropriate instruction or notice required pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and Pledge Agreement, to effect the exercise of such rights.

 SECTION 4.6 _Exclusive Control_. Securities Intermediary is authorized to act upon any Oral or Written Instructions, including entitlement orders with respect to the securities account that is part of the Indemnification Account and instructions relating to the deposit account that is part of the Indemnification Account, solely and exclusively from Secured Party. Securities Intermediary is authorized to act upon any Oral or Written Instructions, including entitlement orders with respect to the Pledge Collateral Accounts, solely and exclusively from Pledge Collateral Agent. Secured Party hereby covenants for the benefit of Pledgor that Secured Party will not originate entitlement orders or instructions concerning the Indemnification Account or the Indemnification Collateral or cause Pledge Collateral Agent to take any action with respect to the Pledge Collateral or the Pledge Collateral Accounts except as provided in Sections 2.8, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 hereof with respect to payment of Obligations when due, the substitution, withdrawal, release or transfer of Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral, the treatment of proceeds and the exercise its rights as a secured party upon default. The foregoing covenant is for the benefit of Pledgor only and will not be deemed to constitute a limitation on Secured Partys right, as between Securities Intermediary and Secured Party, to originate entitlement orders and instructions with respect to the Indemnification Account and the Indemnification Collateral, on Securities Intermediarys obligation to comply with those entitlement orders and instructions 

   ##### 

  

    

without further consent by Pledgor, on Secured Partys right, as between
Secured Party and Pledge Collateral Agent, to instruct Pledge Collateral
Agent to take action with respect to the Pledge Collateral or the Pledge
Collateral Accounts, or on Pledge Collateral Agents obligation to comply with
those instructions without further consent by Pledgor. Securities
Intermediary agrees that it will, without inquiry or consent of Pledgor or
any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of Pledgor, comply with Oral
or Written Instructions (including entitlement orders and instructions
relating to the deposit account that is part of the Indemnification Account)
from Secured Party with respect to the Indemnification Account. Without
prejudice to the exclusive right of Secured Party to give entitlement orders,
if Securities Intermediary receives conflicting directions with respect to
the Indemnification Account or the Indemnification Collateral from Pledgor
and Secured Party, Securities Intermediary will act at the direction of
Secured Party and will be fully protected in so acting. Pledge Collateral
Agent agrees to comply with instructions given pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement and with instructions given by Secured Party pursuant to this
Agreement without further consent from Pledgor. If instructions of Secured
Party to Pledge Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement conflict with the
obligations of the Pledge Collateral Agent under the Pledge Agreement, Pledge
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to comply with the Pledge Agreement and
not to comply with such conflicting instructions given pursuant to
this Agreement.

Each of Pledgor and Secured Party may elect to receive advices and statements electronically through the Internet to an email address specified by it for such purpose. By electing to use the Internet for this purpose, each of Pledgor and Secured Party acknowledges that such transmissions are not encrypted and therefore are insecure. Each of Pledgor and Secured Party further acknowledges that there are other risks inherent in communicating through the Internet such as the possibility of virus contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that Securities Intermediary shall not be responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by Pledgor, Secured Party, or any person claiming by or through Pledgor or Secured Party as a result of the use of such methods. 

  

 SECTION 4.8 _Notice of Adverse Claims_. Upon receipt of written notice of any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim against the Indemnification Account, the Pledge Collateral Accounts or any portion of the Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral, Securities Intermediary shall use reasonable efforts to notify Secured Party and Pledgor as promptly as practicable under the circumstances. 

  

 SECTION 4.9 _Subordination of Lien; Set-off_. The parties agree that any security interest in or lien on, or right of set-off with respect to, any of the Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge Collateral that Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent may now or in the future may have is hereby subordinated to the security interest of Secured Party hereunder, except to the extent of any fees, charges, expenses and other amounts owed to Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent and incurred in connection with the performance of the duties of 

   ##### 

  

    

Securities Intermediary hereunder and the maintenance and operation of the
Indemnification Account and the Indemnification Collateral, for which
Securities Intermediary shall have a prior claim to the Indemnification
Collateral. 

  

 SECTION 4.10 _No Release Without Consent_. Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent agree that they will not extend any credit nor make any loans secured by the Indemnification Collateral, the Indemnification Account, the Pledge Collateral or the Pledge Collateral Accounts, including without limitation any so-called "margin loans."

Pledgor shall also reimburse Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses which are a normal incident of the services provided hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 5.8 _Effectiveness of Instructions; Reliance; Risk Acknowledgements; Additional Terms_. 

  

 (a) Secured Party shall have the right, by one or more written instruments executed and delivered to Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement or involve Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent in personal liability and (ii) Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent shall be indemnified to its satisfaction as provided herein. Subject to the terms below, Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent shall be entitled, in the absence of bad faith, to rely upon any Written or Oral Instructions actually received by Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, respectively, and reasonably believed by it to have been duly authorized and delivered by Secured Party. Secured Party agrees to forward to Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, Written Instructions confirming its Oral Instructions by the close of business of the same day that such Oral Instructions are given to Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, and the fact that such confirming Written Instructions are not received shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of transactions authorized and effected by Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to its Oral Instructions. 

  

 (b) In each case that Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent may or is required hereunder to take any action, including without limitation to make any determination or judgment, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to 

   ##### 

  

    

release or sell Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral or otherwise
to act hereunder, the Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent may
seek direction from Secured Party. Securities Intermediary or Pledge
Collateral Agent shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction from
Secured Party. Unless direction is otherwise expressly provided herein, if
Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent shall request direction
from Secured Party with respect to any action, Securities Intermediary
or Pledge Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such action
unless and until such agent shall have received direction from Securities
Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, and the agent shall not incur
liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. 

  

 (c) If Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent receives Written Instructions which appear on their face to have been transmitted via (i) computer facsimile, email, the Internet or other insecure electronic method, or (ii) secure electronic transmission containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys, Secured Party understands and agrees that neither Securities Intermediary nor Pledge Collateral Agent can determine the identity of the actual sender of such Written Instructions and that Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall conclusively presume that such Written Instructions have been sent by an Authorized Person. Secured Party shall be responsible for ensuring that only its Authorized Persons transmit such Written Instructions to Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent and that all of its Authorized Persons treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys with extreme care. 

  

 (d) Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting Written Instructions to Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting Written Instructions than the method(s) selected by it.

gross negligence or bad faith on the part of Securities Intermediary and
Pledge Collateral Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established
by a certificate signed by one of the Secured Partys officers, and delivered
to Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent and such certificate,
in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent, shall be full warrant to
the Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the
faith thereof.

 SECTION 5.13 _Global Custody Terms and Conditions_. The Indemnification Account and the Indemnification Collateral shall be subject to the Global Custody Terms and Conditions attached hereto as Appendix B, except that in the event of any conflict between the express provisions of this Agreement and such Global Custody Terms and Conditions, the express provisions of this Agreement shall control.

Secured Party shall promptly notify Pledgor of any resignation or removal of

6.1. Upon any such resignation or removal, Secured Party shall have the right
to appoint a successor Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary, as
the case may be, provided, such appointment of the Pledge Collateral Agent
also complies with the Pledge Agreement. If no successor Pledge Collateral
Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Pledge
Collateral Agents or Securities Intermediarys giving of notice of
resignation or Secured Partys giving notice of such removal, then the
retiring or removed Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of Secured
Party, for the appointment of a successor Pledge Collateral Agent or
Securities Intermediary. Pledge Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary
shall each be a bank, trust company or national banking association with a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary
hereunder by a successor Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary,
as the case may be, such successor Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities
Intermediary, as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and
the retiring Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case
may be, shall take all appropriate action, subject to payment of any amounts
then due and payable to it hereunder, to transfer any money and property held
by it hereunder (including the Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge

Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its
duties and obligations as Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary
hereunder. After any retiring Pledge Collateral Agents or Securities
Intermediarys resignation hereunder as Pledge Collateral Agent or
Securities Intermediary, the provisions of Article V shall continue in effect
for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was acting as the Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities
Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of Pledge Collateral Agent or
Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such person is acting as
Pledge Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary, shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of
Pledge Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary.

No failure on the part of Secured Party, Pledgor, Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by Secured Party, Pledgor, Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent of any right preclude any other future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Severability; Amendments; Assignment_. In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected thereby.

Secured Party, Pledgor, Pledge Collateral Agent, Securities Intermediary and Stock Purchase Contract Agent hereby consent to the jurisdiction of a state or federal court situated in New York City, New York in connection with any dispute arising hereunder. To the extent that in any jurisdiction Secured Party, Pledgor, Securities Intermediary, Pledge Collateral Agent or Stock Purchase Contract Agent may now or hereafter be entitled to claim, for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment) or other legal process, they each irrevocably agree not to claim, and hereby waives, such immunity.

 SECTION 6.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute only one instrument. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _USA PATRIOT ACT_. Pledgor and Secured Party hereby acknowledge that Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent are subject to federal laws, including the Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements under the USA PATRIOT Act and its 

   ##### 

  

    

implementing regulations, pursuant to which Securities Intermediary and Pledge
Collateral Agent must obtain, verify and record information that allows
Securities Intermediary or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to
identify each of Pledgor and Secured Party. Accordingly, prior to opening

identification number and other information that will help Securities
Intermediary to identify and verify each of Pledgors and Secured Partys

license to do business, or other pertinent identifying information. Pledgor
and Secured Party agree that Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral

Surety Bonds and Indemnification Agreements

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 Reference is hereby made to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2010 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AIG"), ALICO Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Acquiror_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this letter agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 Reference is also hereby made to the agreements set forth in _Schedule I_ attached to this Agreement (the " _Guarantee Agreements_ "). The Acquiror hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to _Section 6.09_ of the Purchase Agreement, the Acquiror (or, with AIGs consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Acquiror) is required to deliver this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

 

In consideration of the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, (a) the Acquiror (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless each of the parties to any Guarantee Agreement other than
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (the " _Guarantors_ ")
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Liability (as
defined below) incurred by such Indemnified Party arising under the terms of
any of the Guarantee Agreements (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") and (b)
the Acquiror agrees, upon notice from the Company, any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or any of the Guarantors, to promptly pay, in
immediately available funds, any and all Guaranteed Obligations that are then
due and payable, on behalf of the applicable Guarantor. 

   

 For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Liability_ " shall mean any and all losses, costs, claims, obligations, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), damages, penalties, fines or other liabilities (whether known or unknown, whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued, whether liquidated or unliquidated and whether due or to become due) arising under the terms of the Guarantee Agreements. 

  

 The liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement is absolute, direct and immediate, not subject to any set-off or counterclaim and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the Indemnifying Party or any other Person. All the terms and provisions of this Agreement are recourse obligations of the Indemnifying Party and not restricted by any limitation on personal liability. 

  

 Upon payment of any obligations owing to an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights of such Indemnified Party under the applicable Guarantee Agreement, and such Indemnified Party agrees to take, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, such steps as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request to implement such subrogation. 

  

 In the event that the Indemnifying Party becomes a party to any transaction that would result in the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Indemnifying Party, whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to one or more Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made prior to the consummation of any such transaction so that each such Person shall assume the obligations of the Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 This Agreement shall be binding on, and the term "Indemnifying Party," as used in this Agreement, shall include, the successors, assigns and other transferees of the Indemnifying Party. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Guarantors and each of their respective successors, assigns and other transferees. The obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement shall be deemed to be continuing in nature and shall remain in full force and effect and shall survive until there are no longer any Guaranteed Obligations outstanding or contracted or committed for under any of the Guarantee Agreements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 To the extent permitted by law, the Indemnifying Party hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any defense that may arise by reason of any principle or provision of law, statutory or otherwise, which is or might be in conflict with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Indemnified Parties shall not be required to resort first to any other Persons, their properties or estates for indemnification as contemplated by this Agreement or to any collateral, property, liens or other rights available to them for indemnification as contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto respecting the matters set forth in this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties hereto respecting such matters. Any amendments or modifications to any term or provision of this Agreement, to be effective, shall be in writing and executed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not limit, reduce or otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of the terms of any of the Guarantee Agreements. 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF SUCH STATE TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. 

  

 All notices, requests, demands, claims or other communications to be sent by one party hereto to another under this Agreement shall be in writing and in accordance with _Section 12.02_ of the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 The failure of any party hereto to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement, or to promptly enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof nor give rise to any estoppel against such party nor excuse any of the parties hereto from their respective obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 In the event it is necessary for any Indemnified Party to retain the services of an attorney or any other consultants to enforce this Agreement, or any portion thereof, the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay to such Indemnified Party any and all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys fees incurred by such Indemnified Party as a result thereof. 

  

 A separate right of action under this Agreement shall arise each time any Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of any matter to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement. Separate and successive actions may be brought under this Agreement to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement at any time and from time to time. No action under this Agreement shall preclude any subsequent action under this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH. 

  

 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. 

  

 This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, binding on all the parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 

  

 This Agreement is entered into for the benefit of the Guarantors, the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (and whether or not any Guarantor is a party hereto, shall be enforceable by such Guarantor as if a party hereto), and is executed and delivered, as of the date first set forth above.

 In addition, we have examined originals (or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other agreements, instruments, certificates, documents and records and have reviewed such questions of law and made such inquiries as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinions rendered herein. 

  

 In such examination, we have assumed, without inquiry, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures on all documents examined by us, the authenticity of

all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original
documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic,
certified/or photostatic copies and the authenticity of such originals. As to
any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not
independently establish or verify, we have relied upon the aforesaid
agreements, instruments, certificates, documents and records (including those
specifically noted in (a) through (s) above) and upon statements and
certificates of officers and other representatives of the Company and others
and of public officials. 

   

 The Stock Purchase Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement are referred to herein collectively as the "Transaction Documents." As used herein, "Applicable Laws" means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and those laws, rules and regulations of the State of New York and those federal laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America, in each case that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents (other than the U.S. federal securities laws, state securities or blue sky laws, federal and state antifraud laws and the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.), but without our having made any special investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation; and "Governmental Authorities" means any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body of the State of New York or the United States of America having jurisdiction over the Company under the Applicable Laws and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,. 

  

 We have assumed for purposes of this letter, without investigation, that: (i) each of the parties to any of the Transaction Documents (other than the Company) and each person executing and delivering any of the Transaction Documents or who will execute and deliver, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, by or on behalf of any such party (other than the Company), has or will have, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, the full power, authority and legal capacity (including the taking of all requisite action) to execute, deliver and perform, or cause the performance of, as the case may be, such partys obligations under such documents, and each of such parties (other than the Company) has been or will be, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, duly formed and organized and is or will be, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, validly existing and, if applicable, in good standing, in the respective jurisdiction of its formation; (ii) each of the parties to any of the Transaction Documents (other than the Company) has or will have, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, duly authorized and executed and delivered each such Transaction Document; (iii) each of the Transaction Documents constitutes or will constitute, in the case of the Supplemental Indentures, a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each party thereto (other than the Company); (iv) the execution and delivery by any party (other than the Company) of, and its performance of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents and the Supplemental Indentures do not and will not contravene, conflict with, violate, or result in a breach of or default under (a) any of such partys constitutive documents, (b) any law, rule, regulation, resolution, guideline, interpretation, restriction, limitation, policy, procedure, ordinance, order, writ, judgment, decree, determination,

or ruling applicable to such party, or to the property of such party, or (c)
any agreement, document, instrument, obligation, or commitment binding on any
party to the Transaction Documents or to which it or its property is subject;
(v) the execution and delivery by the Company of, and its performance of its
obligations under the Transaction Documents and the Supplemental
Indentures do not and will not contravene, conflict with, violate, or result
in a breach of or default under any law, rule, regulation, resolution,
guideline, interpretation, restriction, limitation, policy, procedure,
ordinance, order, writ, judgment, decree, determination, or ruling applicable
to the Company, other than any Applicable Law; (vi) to the extent that any
opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and
choice of New York forum provisions of the Transaction Documents, our opinion
is rendered in reliance upon Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the General
Obligations Law of the State of New York and is subject to the qualification
that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations;
(vii) except to the extent specifically addressed in our opinion in paragraph
17 below and, solely in the case of the Closing Preferred Shares and the
Conversion Shares, paragraphs 10 and 11 below, any authorization, approval,
consent, waiver, or other action by, notice to, or filing, qualification, or

EXHIBIT I 

   

FORM OF METHODOLOGY FOR THE CALCULATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL 
 AND TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL 

  

Methodology for the calculation of Risk Based Capital and Total Adjusted
Capital 

 

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Exhibit I shall have
the respective meanings assigned to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement
dated March 7, 2010, among ALICO Holdings LLC, American International Group,
Inc. and MetLife, Inc. 

  

For purposes of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Transaction Agreements
and the transactions contemplated thereby, the American Life Insurance
Company Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (" _RBC_ ") and Total
Adjusted Capital (" _TAC_ ") will be calculated according to the NAIC rules
applicable to filing RBC reports at December 31, 2009 notwithstanding the fact
that the Company is exempt from filing such reports, with the following
changes: 

   

       | 1.  |   | For the purposes of Section 2.07 (d) of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the RBC calculation will be based on the two latest
quarterly or annual statutory financial statements filed with the state of
domicile (the " _Statutory Financial Statements_ ") and the records and
financial data associated with such statements and necessary to perform RBC
calculations as defined herein. If due to the timing of the closing, one or
both of the Statutory Financial Statements are quarterly Statutory Financial
Statements, certain exhibits and schedules not contained in that statement
but referenced to in the RBC Instructions will be supplemented by the
Companys records and financial data used in the preparation of the latest
Statutory Financial Statements, as specified in Appendix 4\. If, according to
Section 2.07 (e) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company prepares
the Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements, such Actual Closing
Statutory Financial Statements should be used for RBC calculation and any
statutory information necessary to prepare RBC at the quarterly level of
detail as specified herein will be obtained from the records and work papers
used in the preparation of the Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements.
In order to prepare the estimated RBC at the Closing as specified in
Section 2.07 (b)(ii) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, approximate methods may
be used provided that such method shall start from the latest Statutory
Financial Statements brought forward by a combination of most recent Standard
Internal (" _SI_ ") information; also ledger records and transaction records
would be used to account for the changes that occurred in the period between
the latest Statutory Financial Statements and the Closing Date.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 2.  |   | Pursuant to section 1104 of the Delaware Insurance Code,
the Company shall use the local statutory reserving basis, as prescribed in
the countries where liabilities are written.  
      
    | 3.  |   | In the RBC calculation, the UK operations which are
included in the Delaware statutory financials as a separate account will be
split into general and separate account components. The general account
elements of the UK separate account statutory  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | statement will be included in the general account
related calculations according to their characteristics, while the separate
account elements will be included in the separate account related
calculations as specified in Appendix 1.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 4.  |   | In the RBC calculation, various asset, liability and
profit and loss accounts of subsidiaries will be itemized and entered into
the applicable formulas as if they were consolidated into the corresponding
financial statement of the Company (or a branch thereof, as applicable) as
specified in Appendix 2.  
      
    | 5.  |   | The Companys holding of AIG Financial Assurance Japan
KK will not be consolidated in the RBC calculation referenced in item 8 and
will be eliminated from TAC as specified in item 6.  
      
    | 6.  |   | TAC will be reduced by goodwill resulting from excess of
cost over net assets acquired in acquisitions of stakes in subsidiaries by
the Company, and the statutory value of the Parent stock net of related
deferred tax, and the statutory value of the the Company holding in AIG
Financial Assurance Japan KK.  
      
    | 7.  |   | TAC will include certain Other Invested Assets and Real
Estate partnerships that are not admitted to statutory surplus due to a
requirement to perform GAAP audits for non-insurance holdings, and
corresponding additions will be made to the appropriate line items in the
calculation of the asset risk requirements of the RBC formula.  
      
    | 8.  |   | If one of the statements used for the RBC calculation is
the Companys Annual Statutory Financial Statement, bonds and preferred
stocks in the branches will be assigned NAIC class designations as reported
in the Annual Statement. If one or both of the statements used for the RBC
calculation is the Companys Quarterly Statutory Financial Statement or the
Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements, the NAIC class designations
will be assigned based on the rating agency classification as specified in
Appendix 3.  
      
    | 9.  |   | The Mortgage Experience Adjustment factor will be set
equal to one.  
      
    | 10.  |   | Unaffiliated Common stock including mutual funds will
be charged with the average factor of 30% without beta adjustment.  
      
    | 11.  |   | Replicated assets will not be included.  
      
    | 12.  |   | The costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries in connection with the Required Pre-Closing
Separation Actions up to $21,500,000 from execution of the Stock Purchase
Agreement until Closing, including any portion required to be capitalized
under SAP, will be disregarded for purposes hereof and deemed not to
reduce the income, earnings and assets of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries and will be added back to capital and surplus. For the avoidance
of doubt, (x) any out-of-pocket costs paid by the Company or a Transferred
Subsidiary to an unaffiliated Person, (y) any out-of-pocket costs paid by the
Parent, the Seller or any of their Affiliates to an unaffiliated Person and
reimbursed by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary, and (z)  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | any out-of-pocket costs paid by the Parent, the
Seller or any of their Affiliates to an unaffiliated Third Party and recorded
on the financial statements of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary as an
amount payable or other liability to the Parent, the Seller or any of their
Affiliates, shall all be considered costs and expenses incurred by the
Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries for the purposes of this item.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 13.  |   | All deductions to the income, earnings and assets of
the Company, including any portion of such expenses that are capitalized but
non-admitted under SAP, in an amount equal to the lesser of $65 million and
the aggregate of such deductions, with respect to the projects detailed in
Section I of the Seller Disclosure Letter will be added back to capital
and surplus.  
      
    | 14.  |   | The costs and expenses associated with preparing the
Required Information or otherwise complying with the Sellers and Parents
obligations under Section 6.16 of the Stock Purchase Agreement will be deemed
not to reduce the income, earnings and assets of the Company and will be
disregarded, including any portion of such costs and expenses required to be
capitalized under SAP and such amounts will be added back to surplus.  
      
    | 15.  |   | The Asset Concentration Factor and the Asset
Concentration Factor for Common Stock will be calculated for the total
listing of assets held in the Companys branches and subsidiaries, in
accordance with the RBC instructions and procedures specified in Appendix 3.
the Companys investment in its subsidiaries will not be treated as Common
Stock in the Top 5 Common Stock concentrations.  
      
    | 16.  |   | For subsidiaries, bonds and preferred stock will be
assigned to NAIC classes based on their rating agency classification as
specified in Appendix 4.  
      
    | 17.  |   | C3 Phase 1, C3 Phase 2 and, if in force at the time of
the calculation, C3 Phase 3 calculations will not be used. Standard factors
for business with Asset Adequacy testing in the RBC worksheet will be applied
for C3 calculation as specified by inserting "Yes" in line 1.1 and "No" in
lines 1.2 and 1.3 of the LR25 of the RBC model.  
      
    | 18.  |   | For calculation dates that are other than December
31st, the income statement items that enter the RBC formula will use the most
recent four calendar quarters of data as of the date of the calculation.  
      
    | 19.  |   | In the event that the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary sells its interest in the Section 6.08 Asset at the request of the
Acquiror pursuant to Section 6.08(g) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, 50% of
any resulting decrease in the income, earnings or assets of the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries will be disregarded and the amount thereof
added back to capital and surplus.  
      
    | 20.  |   | In the event that the Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary retains its interest in the Section 6.08 Asset and suffers any
impairment or reduction in income, earnings or assets resulting from, arising
out of or relating to Section 6.08(g) of the Stock Purchase  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Agreement or the operation thereof, such impairment
or reduction will be disregarded and the amount thereof added back to capital
and surplus.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

Appendix 1\. Treatment of the UK in the RBC calculation 

  

In the Company statutory filing the whole of the UK operation is presented as
a separate account (the " _UK Green Book_ "), even though the UK operation
has both separate and general account business. In the RBC calculation, the
UK Green Book will be split into its general and separate account components,
as follows: 

  

1\. The Protected Recovery Fund (" _PRF_ ") consists of a unit-linked account
value liability backed by separate account assets and a general account
statutory reserve established in respect of the Companys obligations under
the PRF (the " _PRF Statutory Reserve_ "). The unit-linked account value
liability and assets backing it will be treated as a separate account for
RBC calculation purposes in accordance with the statutory filing. The PRF
Statutory Reserve will be included in the total liabilities with the effect
of decreasing the statutory surplus and Total Adjusted Capital in the RBC
calculation. 

  

2\. The Guaranteed Income Fund (" _GIB_ ") is classified as an ordinary life
liability in the statutory filing, as reflected in the RBC calculation.
Assets in the GIB segregated portfolio will be added to the appropriate
categories according to the RBC instructions. GIB reserves and Face Amounts
will be added to the appropriate categories in RBC work sheets. 

  

3\. The Standard Fund is a unit linked liability backed by separate account
asset and will be accounted for and treated in the RBC calculation as a
separate account product. 

  

4\. All other products with policyholder risks and without a guarantee will be
considered separate accounts and will be treated as such. 

  

5\. General account including Individual Life, Group Life, Group Credit Life,
Pensions, Annuities and AandH products will be classified as general account
business and will be treated accordingly per RBC calculation rules. 

  

6\. Assets representing statutory surplus in the UK general account will be
added to the appropriate asset classes of the RBC calculation. 

   

Appendix 2\. Treatment of the Company Subsidiaries in the RBC Calculation 

  

Subsidiaries of the Company are carried in the Statutory Financial Statements
as part of the Common Stock Investment (page 2) and are not itemized in a
line by line balance sheet. In the accounting process leading to the
statutory equity in subsidiaries, the reserves of each of the
insurance subsidiaries will be valued in accordance with the requirements of
the respective foreign jurisdiction where it conducts business and has
invested funds as permitted by the laws of each jurisdiction where it does
business, consistent with the reporting required under the Delaware Insurance
Code. Invested assets and items other than reserves, are accounted for on the
Delaware statutory accounting basis, consistent with the statutory reporting
for the branches. The 

      ##### 

  

    

statutory equity in each subsidiary on the above accounting basis shall be
reconciled to its audited local statutory statement filed with the insurance
regulator in the jurisdiction of operation. The equity of all subsidiaries
combined shall equal the carrying value included in the Common Stock in the
Delaware statutory balance sheet. The Company will utilize its
statutory financial data used in preparation of the statutory value of equity
in the subsidiaries in the RBC calculation. 

  

The combined balance sheet of the Companys subsidiaries is compiled using the
SI balance sheet exhibits and supporting work papers and ledger information.
The SI financials are the format in which the Company submits its GAAP-basis
financials to the Parent, and include statutory and GAAP sections. The
process follows the following sequence of steps: 

   

       | 1.  |   | Beginning with Consolidated statutory-basis SI
balance sheet, subtract the Branches Balance sheet from the total, to arrive
at Subsidiaries Internal Balance Sheet containing an itemized listing of
asset and liabilities by item at the SI level of detail. All assets and
liabilities in the subsidiaries balance sheets, except for the amount
designated as such in the Equity section, are gross of the minority interest
and will be included in the RBC calculation on that basis.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 2.  |   | Remove AIG FAJ, a parent company of AIG Edison, balance
sheet from each line of the consolidated balance sheet.  
      
    | 3.  |   | Adjust non-qualifying Separate Accounts from the GAAP-
based to statutory categorization according to the ledger accounts that
contain statutory product classifications of the liabilities and assets
backing such liabilities.  
      
    | 4.  |   | Adjust Mutual Funds. Re-class mutual funds classified in
SI as Other Invested Assets according to certain GAAP requirements, into the
Mutual Funds category.  
      
    | 5.  |   | Assign Delaware statutory adjustments reflecting
goodwill, non-admitted assets and certain other adjustments used in
preparation of the value of investment in subsidiaries in the statutory
filing, using an internal work paper known as Subsidiaries Carrying
Value calculation.  
   

 

This pro-forma balance sheet will be used as an integrated financial statement
to which all subsidiaries RBC input can be compared, and to populate some
items in the RBC model. 

  

Ratings for bonds in subsidiaries will be obtained from the Companys
investment system and associated records and categorized according to the
equivalent of NAIC Class ratings as specified in Appendix 3\. Non-rated
securities that are issued in the currency of the country of the
issuers domicile will be assigned the sovereign rating of the government
debt of that country. Non-rated issues that are issued in a currency other
than that of the country of the issuers domicile will be assigned the cross-
border sovereign rating for the country of the issuers domicile. 

  

Unaffiliated common stock held as an investment asset in a subsidiarys
portfolio will be calculated using the Subsidiaries Balance Sheet described
above and will include mutual funds in the general accounts. 

       ##### 

  

    

Separate account assets will be obtained from the ledger accounts that reflect
the statutory product characteristics of the liabilities. There is presently
not a surplus in the Subsidiaries separate accounts. Should there be a
surplus in subsidiaries separate accounts at the time of Closing it would be
included in the appropriate RBC calculation worksheet. 

  

Concentration calculations with respect to stock investments and other
investments of the subsidiaries will be undertaken in conjunction with such
calculations for the Companys branches. 

  

Investment or occupancy real estate categories in subsidiary values will be
obtained from the Subsidiaries Balance sheet above and a work paper
classifying investment and occupancy break-down. The real estate values will
include occupied and investment real estate holdings in the
operating subsidiaries and the real estate properties located in Japan and
held in the special purpose vehicle subsidiaries of the Company. 

  

Other invested assets in subsidiaries will be obtained from the Subsidiaries
Balance Sheet described above and categorized as "Other Schedule BA Assets"
and charged according to the RBC instructions for that category. 

  

Cash and short term assets will be obtained from Subsidiaries Balance Sheet
described above and categorized according to the RBC instructions. 

  

All other assets in subsidiaries not captured in specific RBC categories will
be included in the Write-In category. 

  

Policyholder liabilities in subsidiaries will be classified according to the
product characteristics into categories according to the RBC model worksheet.
The Company will use its product documentation and financial statements to
identify proper classification of such products. 

  

Benefit reserves will be obtained from the source statutory ledgers, by line
of business, and include categories classified in the ledger as Reserves as
well as Policyholder Deposits with guarantees. The Peak Performance Fund
(PPF) liabilities in Ireland, a wrapped money market product with a principal
guarantee on maturity only, will be categorized as All Other Reserves Medium
Risk. 

  

The face amounts for individual, group and credit lines of business for
subsidiaries will be obtained from the companys standard quarterly In-Force
Report. 

  

AandH premiums, claims and other PandL items will be obtained from the statutory
ledger, by line of business that corresponds to the appropriate RBC line
classification, and will represent the rolling 4 quarters ending at the
quarter end preceding closing, except for premiums in the C4 calculation. 

  

Separate account liabilities will be obtained from the ledger accounts that
reflect the statutory product characteristics of the liabilities. 

       ##### 

  

    

 _Consolidation_  

  

Once branch and subsidiary charges are calculated, they will be added together
on a single worksheet entitled Calculation of Authorized Control Level of
Capital (LR29), except as follows (which will be consolidated, as
indicated): 

  

The number of bond issuers will be calculated for the consolidated holding of
branches and subsidiaries combined. 

  

The Asset Concentration Factor and the Asset Concentration Factor for Common
Stock will be calculated for the consolidated holding of branches and
subsidiaries combined. 

  

The single consolidated TAC will be used for the calculation of the
consolidated RBC, divided by the consolidated charges at the Companys
Company Action Level of branches and subsidiaries combined. 

   

Appendix 3\. Assignment of NAIC classes 

  

Bonds will be assigned class ratings as follows: 

  

A bond listing from the Companys investment systems will be obtained and NAIC
classes will be assigned to the ratings in the investment listing according
to the table below. SandP rating will be used first. If SandP is unavailable, the
Moodys rating will be used. If Moodys is unavailable, the Fitch rating will
be used. If no external rating agency rating is available, the Parents
internal Obligor Risk Rating (ORR) will be used. 

  

       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Appendix 4\. Company Records Used in off Year End Calculations 

  

The NAIC RBC Instructions are designed for the annual RBC calculation and
contain references to the parts of the statutory statements that are only
available on an annual basis. The below specifies treatment of items not
available from any Statutory Financial Statements other than the
annual statements. 

  

Bond Rating. Bond carrying values and rating agency ratings will be obtained
from the Companys investment system and associated records and reconciled
against the book values in the Statutory Financial Statement or the Actual
Closing Statutory Financial Statements used for 

      ##### 

  

    

preparation of RBC. The NAIC classes will be assigned to rating agency ratings
as specified in appendix 3. 

  

Common Stock: The Common Stock values will be obtained by using the Page 2
value of the Common Stock in the Companys Statutory Financial Statement or
the Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements and subtracting Investment
in Subsidiaries used in preparation of said statement from the Subsidiaries
Carrying Value workpaper. 

  

Benefit liabilities: Full break down of liabilities for the C2 and C3
calculation referencing certain Notes to Statutory Financial Statement or the
Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements is not available on the
quarterly basis. An exhibit approximating the classification will be prepared
internally for major categories. For categories where the quarterly data is
unavailable, the latest annual figure or the figure in the Actual Closing
Statutory Financial Statements will be used. 

  

Face Amount in the Net Amount at Risk calculation: an internal report known as
Quarterly In-Force Report will be used to calculate the Net Amount at Risk.

 We have acted as counsel to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in connection with the Indemnification Collateral Account Security and Control Agreement, dated as of [], 2010 (the "Indemnification Security Agreement"), among MetLife, Inc., as Secured Party ("Secured Party"), ALICO Holdings LLC, as Pledgor ("Pledgor"), [], as Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent, and [], as Stock Purchase Contract Agent. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings given to them in the Indemnification Security Agreement. 

   

 In that connection, we have examined the documents referred to above and have also examined the originals or certified, conformed of photographic copies of other documents, records, agreements and certificates, and have made such examinations of law, as we have considered necessary to render the opinion hereinafter set forth. 

   

 Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that: 

   

 1\. The Indemnification Security Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Pledgor and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Pledgor, enforceable against Pledgor in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. 

   

 2\. The Indemnification Security Agreement is effective under the New York Uniform Commercial Code (the "New York UCC") to create in favor of Secured Party a security interest in the Indemnification Collateral and to create in favor of the Pledge Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Party a security interest in the Pledge Collateral as security for the Obligations. 

   

 3\. Secured Partys security interest in the Indemnification Account (to the extent such account is a securities account) and the Pledge Collateral Agents security interest in each Pledge Collateral Account (to the extent such account is a securities 

     #####

account) and the security entitlements credited thereto were perfected upon
the execution and delivery of the Indemnification Security Agreement by
Secured Party and the Pledge Collateral Agent, respectively, as entitlement
holder of such securities account. 

   

 4\. No action based on an adverse claim to a financial asset credited to a securities account constituting part of the Indemnification Account may be asserted against Secured Partys security interest therein, and no action based on an adverse claim to a financial asset credited to any Pledge Collateral Account may be asserted against the Pledge Collateral Agents security interest therein. 

   

 5\. The security interest of Secured Party in the deposit account constituting part of the Indemnification Account is prior to all other liens and security interests in such deposit account created under Article 9 of the New York UCC (other than those, if any, existing in favor of the depository bank and not otherwise effectively subordinated pursuant to the Indemnification Security Agreement or otherwise). 

   

 6\. Each of the financing statements relating to Pledgor attached as Annex A hereto (the "Financing Statements"), when duly filed with the Secretary of the State of Delaware, and upon payment of the required fees, will result in the perfection of the security interest granted by Pledgor in the Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge Collateral referred to in such Financing Statements to the extent that such Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge Collateral consists of the type of property in which a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. 

   

 Our opinion in paragraph (6) above is subject to and qualified by the following, as applicable: 

    

 a. Further filings under the Delaware UCC (as defined below) may be necessary to preserve and maintain the security interest granted by Pledgor (to the extent established and perfected by the filing of financing statements), including, without limitation, the following: 

  

       | i.  |   | appropriate continuation filings to be made within
the period of six months prior to the expiration of the five-year anniversary
dates from the date of the original filings of the Financing Statements;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | ii.  |   | filings required to be made within four months of the
change of name, identity or corporate structure of the debtor to the extent
set forth in Sections 9-507 and 9-508 of the Delaware;  
      

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

-3- 

   

       | iii.  |   | filings required with respect to proceeds of
Indemnification Collateral or the Pledge Collateral under Section 9-315(d) of
the Delaware UCC; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | iv.  |   | filings required if the debtor changes its location, to
the extent set forth in Section 9-301 of the Delaware UCC.  
   

   

 b. Any opinion as to the perfection of any security interest in proceeds (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(64) of the Delaware UCC) is qualified to the extent set forth in Section 9-315 of the Delaware UCC. 

  

 The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications and assumptions, which we have not independently verified: 

   

       | A.  |   | The obligations of Pledgor and the rights and
remedies of Secured Party under Indemnification Security Agreement may be
subject to possible limitations upon the exercise of remedial or procedural
provisions contained therein; _provided_ that such limitations do not, in our
opinion (but subject to the other comments and qualifications set forth in
this opinion), make the remedies and procedures that will be afforded to
Secured Party inadequate for the practical realization of the substantive
benefits purported to be provided to Secured Party pursuant to
such agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | B.  |   | We express no opinion as to the state of title or
ownership of, or the nature or extent of any of Pledgors rights in, the
Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral.  
      
    | C.  |   | In connection with our opinions in paragraphs 4 and 5,
we have assumed that neither the Secured Party nor the Pledge Collateral
Agent has any notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section
8-105 of the Delaware UCC) to the Collateral referred to therein.  
      
    | D.  |   | No opinion is expressed herein with respect to the
creation, validity, enforceability or perfection or priority of any security
interest, except as may be expressly set forth above in this opinion.  
      
    | E.  |   | No opinion is expressed herein with respect to the
validity, binding effect or enforceability of any contractual provisions (i)
purporting to provide indemnification of any person for any claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses resulting from violation by such person of any
applicable securities laws or from the consequences of the gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct of such person or (ii) to the effect that
terms may not  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

-4- 

   

       |   |   | be waived or modified except in writing may be
limited under certain circumstances.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 The terms "securities account", "securities entitlement", "financial asset" and "deposit account" have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the New York Uniform Commercial Code. 

   

 The foregoing opinions are limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. In connection with our opinion in paragraph (6) above, we have reviewed and relied solely upon an official compilation of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code, Title 6 of the Delaware Code (the "Delaware UCC") and our general familiarity with the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in other jurisdictions, and we have not reviewed and do not purport to be expert in Delaware law matters more generally. 

   

 In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that the Indemnification Security Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto other than Pledgor and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each such party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine. 

   

 This opinion is solely for your benefit in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and is not to be relied upon by any other person, firm or entity, nor is it to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or in any other transaction or context without our express prior written consent.

Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own negligent acts, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. 

   

 SECTION 7.2 _Remarketing._ The Collateral Agent shall, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the ninth (9th) Business Day immediately preceding an Applicable Stock Purchase Date, notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Pledged Debt Securities that are to be remarketed and without the need for any instruction from any Holder of Normal Common Equity Units, present the related Pledged Debt Securities of the applicable series to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing.

 SECTION 8.1 _Representations and Warranties._ Each Holder from time to time, acting through the Stock Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent (with respect to such Holders interest in the Collateral), which representations and warranties shall be deemed repeated on each day a Holder Transfers Collateral, that, subject to Section 11.11: 

  

 (a) such Holder has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on the Collateral; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) such Holder is the sole beneficial owner of the Collateral and, in the case of Collateral delivered in physical form, is the sole holder of such Collateral and is the sole beneficial owner of, or has the right to Transfer, the Collateral it Transfers to the Collateral Agent for credit to an applicable Collateral Account, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, call, liability to pay money or other restriction other than the security interest and lien granted under Article II; 

  

 (c) upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent for credit to an applicable Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any securities intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to Article IV); and 

  

 (d) the execution and performance by the Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under Article II, or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets. 

  

 SECTION 8.2 _Covenants._ The Holders from time to time, acting through the Stock Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby covenant to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge, subject to Section 11.11: 

  

 (a) such Holders will not create or purport to create or allow to subsist any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge or any other security interest whatsoever over the Collateral or any part of it other than pursuant to this Agreement, and 

  

 (b) such Holders will not sell or otherwise dispose (or attempt to dispose) of the Collateral or any part of it except for the beneficial interest therein, subject to the Pledge hereunder, transferred in connection with the Transfer of the Common Equity Units.

 The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall act as agent for the Company hereunder with such powers as are specifically vested in the Collateral 

   ##### 

  

 

Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be,
by the terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and

 (c) not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder (except pursuant to directions furnished under Section 9.2 hereof, subject to Section 9.8 hereof, and except as may be required in connection with Section 11.11); 

  

 (d) not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct; and

 Subject to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary are not at any time under any duty to monitor the value of any Collateral in the Collateral Account or whether the Collateral is of a type required or permitted to be held in the Collateral Account. 

  

 The Collateral Agent, Securities Intermediary and Custodial Agent shall only be responsible for transferring money, securities or other property in accordance with the terms herein to the extent that such money, securities or other property is credited to the respective Collateral Account. 

  

 No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability 

   ##### 

  

 

in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights
or powers hereunder. In no event shall the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent
or the Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the
Value of the Collateral. 

   

 SECTION 9.2 _Instructions of the Company._ The Company shall have the right, by one or more written instruments executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to the Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on the Collateral Agent, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement or involve the Collateral Agent in personal liability and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall be indemnified to its satisfaction as provided herein. None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has any obligation or responsibility to file any UCC financing or continuation statements or to take any other actions to create, preserve or maintain the security interest in the Collateral except as expressly set forth herein, including, without limitation, in connection with Section 11.11. 

  

 SECTION 9.3 _Reliance by Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary._ Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, in the absence of bad faith, to rely conclusively upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other written communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by e-mail or similar electronic means, telecopy, telex or facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein) and consult with and conclusively rely upon advice, opinions and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Company in accordance with this Agreement. The Company shall be responsible for ensuring that only its authorized persons transmit such written instructions to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and that all of its authorized persons treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys with extreme care. 

  

 It is understood that the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided by the Company to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may apply any of the deposited funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may result in a Person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank, or an intermediary bank, designated by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that payment is made to the account as specified by the Company. 

  

 In each case that the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may or is required hereunder to take any action, including without limitation to make any determination 

   ##### 

  

 

or judgment, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to
release or sell Collateral or otherwise to act hereunder, the Collateral
Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may seek direction from the
Company. The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary
shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction from the Company.
Unless direction is otherwise expressly provided herein, if the Collateral
Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall request direction
from the Company with respect to any action, the Collateral Agent, Custodial
Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refrain from such
action unless and until such agent shall have received direction from the
Company, and the agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of
so refraining. 

   

 SECTION 9.4 _Certain Rights._  

  

 (a) Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by one of the Companys officers, and delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, shall be full warrant to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof. 

  

 (b) The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.

 SECTION 9.6 _Rights in Other Capacities._ The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary and their affiliates may (without having to account therefor to the Company) accept deposits from, lend money to, make their investments in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, any other 

   ##### 

  

 

Person interested herein and any Holder of Common Equity Units (and any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) as if it were not acting as the
Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the
case may be, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities
Intermediary and their affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from
the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and any Holder of Common Equity Units
without having to account for the same to the Company; provided that each of
the Securities Intermediary, the Custodial Agent and the Collateral Agent
covenants and agrees with the Company that it shall not accept, receive
or permit there to be created in favor of itself and shall take no
affirmative action to permit there to be created in favor of any other
Person, any security interest, lien or other encumbrance of any kind in or
upon the Collateral other than the lien created by the Pledge.

None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have any duty or responsibility to provide the Company with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Common Equity Units (or any of their respective affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective affiliates. 

  

 SECTION 9.8 _Compensation and Indemnity._  

  

 The Company agrees to: 

  

 (a) pay the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by them hereunder; 

  

 (b) indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and each of their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) and taxes (other than those based upon, determined by or measured by the income of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary) (collectively, "Losses" and individually, a "Loss") that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them for following any instructions or other directions upon which either the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary is entitled to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, _provided_ that the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has not acted with gross negligence or engaged in willful misconduct with respect to the specific Loss against which indemnification is sought; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) in addition to and not in limitation of paragraph (b) immediately above, indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of them harmless from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them in connection with or arising out of the Collateral Agents, the Custodial Agents or the Securities Intermediarys acceptance or performance of its powers and duties under this Agreement, _provided_ that the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has not acted with gross negligence or engaged in willful misconduct with respect to the specific Loss against which indemnification is sought. 

  

 Neither the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have any liability whatsoever for the action or inaction of any Depository. With respect to losses arising out of the acts or failures to act of a Subcustodian (other than an affiliate of Securities Intermediary), Securities Intermediary shall take appropriate action to recover such losses from such Subcustodian, and Securities Intermediarys sole responsibility and liability shall be limited to the amounts so received from such Subcustodian (exclusive of costs and expenses incurred by Securities Intermediary). 

  

 The provisions of this Section and Section 11.7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary and the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.9 _Failure to Act._ In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, then at its sole option, each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall not be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either: 

  

 (a) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary; or 

  

 (b) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to it sufficient to save it harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which it may incur by reason of its acting. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Resignation of Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary._  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below:

 (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company; and 

   

 (iii) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, acting at the direction of the Holders of a majority in number of the Common Equity Units. 

  

 The Stock Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 9.10. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agents, Custodial Agents or Securities Intermediarys giving of notice of resignation or the Companys or the Stock Purchase Contract Agents giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each be a bank, trust company or national banking association with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action, subject to payment of any amounts then due and payable to it hereunder, to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agents, Custodial Agents or Securities Intermediarys resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article IX shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities 

   ##### 

  

 

Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial
Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is
acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary,
shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous
resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Securities Intermediary
or Custodial Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 SECTION 9.11 _Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor._ The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary each shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of their respective duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith. The appointment of agents pursuant to this Section 9.11 shall be subject to prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 SECTION 9.12 _Survival._ The provisions of this Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. 

  

 SECTION 9.13 _Exculpation._ Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them incurred without any act or deed that is found to be attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the Indemnification Security Agreement, upon the release of any Common Equity Units from the pledge pursuant to the Indemnification Security Agreement, such Common Equity Units (including the Corporate Securities or Treasury Securities forming part of such Common Equity Units) shall be free and clear of the lien of the Indemnification Security Agreement.

If, as of the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date for any Dividend Payment Date, (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date is zero (0) or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date has declined by ten percent (10%) or more as compared to the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount as of the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date for such Dividend Payment Date, then the Corporation shall give notice of such circumstance by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders at their respective last addresses appearing on the records of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporations website), not later than the first (1st) Dividend Payment Date following such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date. Such notice shall (i) set forth the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and as of the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date, and (ii) state that the Corporation may be precluded by the terms of the Series [C] Preferred Stock from declaring and paying dividends on such Dividend Payment Date unless the Corporation, through the generation of earnings or issuance of new common equity, increases its Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount by an amount specified in such notice by the second Quarter End after the date of such notice. The Corporation need not give any notice under this Section 5(b) during any period in which the Corporations ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by reason of the application of Section 5(a). 

   

 (c) _Dividend Suspension Notice_. No later than the fifteenth (15th) day prior to each Dividend Payment Date for which dividends are being suspended by reason of the tests set forth in Section 5(a), the Corporation shall give notice of such suspension by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporations website). Such notice, in addition to stating that dividends will be suspended, shall (i) if dividends are suspended by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(i), state that the Covered Insurance Subsidiaries Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio is less than one hundred and seventy five percent (175%) and (ii) if such suspension is by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(ii), set forth the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount as of the most recent Quarter End and the amount by which the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount must increase in order for declaration and payment of dividends to be resumed. 

   

 (d) _Interpretive Provisions; Qualifications, Etc_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 

       ##### 

  

      

 (i) Neither the Board of Directors nor a committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on any date that (w) in the case of a Dividend Declaration Date relating to a Dividend Payment Date in March in any year, is before March 5 in such year; (x) in the case of a Dividend Declaration Date relating to a Dividend Payment Date in June in any year, is before May 15 in such year; (y) in the case of a Dividend Declaration Date relating to a Dividend Payment Date in September in any year, is before August 15 in such year; and (z) in the case of a Dividend Declaration Date relating to a Dividend Payment Date in December in any year, is before November 15 in such year. 

   

 (ii) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 5 or in Section 3, all references in this Section 5 to financial statements of the Corporation shall be deemed to be to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consistently applied, and, for so long as the Corporation is a reporting company under the Exchange Act, filed by the Corporation with the Commission under the Exchange Act. If at any relevant time or for any relevant period the Corporation is not a reporting company under the Exchange Act, then (x) for all relevant dates and periods, the Corporation shall prepare and post on its website the financial statements that it would have been required to file with the Commission had it continued to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act, in each case on or before the dates that the Corporation would have been required to file such financial statements with the Commission under the Exchange Act had it continued to be an "accelerated filer" within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and (y) the provisions of this Section 5 shall be read mutatis mutandis to give effect to such provision. 

   

 (iii) The limitation on dividends provided for in Section 5(a)(i) shall be of no force and effect if, as of a Dividend Declaration Date, the combined total assets of the Insurance Subsidiaries do not account for twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated total assets of the Corporation as reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements filed with the Commission or, in case Section 5(d)(ii) then applies, posted on the Corporations website. 

   

 (iv) All financial terms used in this Section 5 that are not specifically defined, including financial terms used within the definitions of defined terms, shall be determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied to and reflected in the related financial statements of the Corporation as of the relevant dates and for the relevant period, except as provided in the next sentence. If because of a change in U.S. GAAP that results in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle or a restatement: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (x) the Consolidated Net Income Amount for a period is lower or higher than it would have been absent such change, then, for purposes of the calculations under Section 5(a)(ii) for the four (4) fiscal quarters of the Corporation commencing with the fiscal quarter for which such change in U.S. GAAP becomes effective, the Consolidated Net Income Amount shall be calculated on a pro forma basis without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP; or 

   

 (y) the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount as of a Quarter End (whether or not a Preliminary Quarter End Test Date or a Final Quarter End Test Date) is lower or higher than it would have been absent such change, then, for purposes of the calculations under Section 5(a)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 5(a), the Adjusted Stockholders Equity Amount shall be calculated on a pro forma basis without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP, commencing with the first Quarter End as of which such change in U.S. GAAP becomes effective and continuing through (A) for purposes of Section 5(a)(ii), the tenth (10th) Quarter End thereafter, and (B) for purposes of the last sentence of Section 5(a), the Quarter End immediately preceding the first Dividend Payment Date for which the payment of dividends is not restricted by such sentence. 

  

 _Section 6\. ___Liquidation Rights__. 

   

 (a) _Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, per share of Series [C] Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof legally available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, and after satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to creditors of the Corporation, before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Junior Stock, in full an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference Amount per share, together with all dividends (if any) that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution. 

   

 (b) _Partial Payment_. If, in any distribution described in Section 6(a) above, the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preferences in full to all holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, then the amounts paid to the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other Parity Stock shall be paid _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preferences of the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock and the holders of all such other Parity Stock. In any such distribution, the "Liquidation Preference" of any holder of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including any 

      ##### 

  

    

declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other
than Series [C] Preferred Stock and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative
basis, any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as
applicable). 

   

 (c) _Residual Distributions_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, if the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock and Senior Stock, then the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences. 

   

 (d) _Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation_. For purposes of this Section 6, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. 

   

 _Section 7\. ___No Redemption__. The Series [C] Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable at the election of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Series [C] Preferred Stock shall be subject to mandatory exchange pursuant to Section 9. 

   

 _Section 8\. ___Voting Rights__. 

   

 (a) _General_. The Holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by law. 

   

 (b) _Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events_. If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock shall not have been declared and paid for at least six (6) Dividend Periods ending on or before the Exchange Date, whether or not consecutive (a "Nonpayment Event"), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two (2) and the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock, together with the holders of any outstanding shares of Dividend Parity Stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of a total of two (2) additional directors ("Voting Parity Preferred Stock"), voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two (2) additional directors (the "Preferred Stock Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, as a condition to exercising such right to so elect such Preferred Stock Directors, the election of no such Preferred Stock Director shall cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which its securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. 

   

 If the Holders of the Series [C] Preferred Stock, and such other holders of Voting Parity Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, then such directors shall be initially 

      ##### 

  

    

elected following such Nonpayment Event only at a special meeting called at
the request of the holders of record of at least twenty percent (20%) of the
Series [C] Preferred Stock or of any other such series of Voting Parity
Preferred Stock then outstanding, and at each subsequent annual meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation at which time such Nonpayment Event shall be
continuing. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election
of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment Event shall be made by
written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock
or Voting Parity Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation, or as may otherwise be required by law. 

   

 When dividends have been paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) in full on the Series [C] Preferred Stock for at least four (4) Dividend Periods (whether or not consecutive) after a Nonpayment Event, then (1) such Nonpayment Event shall be deemed to have ceased; (2) the number of Dividend Periods in which dividends have not been declared and paid shall, for purposes of this Section 8, be reset to zero (0); (3) the right of the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors on account of such Nonpayment Event shall cease (but subject always to revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event pursuant to this Section 8); (4) the terms of office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate; and (5) the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly. For avoidance of doubt, "full" dividends on the Series [C] Preferred Stock shall in no event include any arrearage, or any dividends that would accrue on unpaid dividends, had dividends on the Series [C] Preferred Stock been cumulative. 

   

 Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series [C] Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Preferred Stock, when they have the voting rights set forth above in this Section 8 (voting together as a single class). So long as a Nonpayment Event shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election of Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment Event) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series [C] Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Preferred Stock, when they have the voting rights set forth above in this Section 8 (voting together as a single class). Each such vote of stockholders to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director must be taken only at a special meeting of such stockholders, called in the same manner as provided above for the initial election of Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment Event. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one (1) vote per director on any matter that shall come before the Board of Directors for a vote. Each Preferred Stock Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal, if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. 

   

 (c) _Other Voting Rights_. So long as any shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 

      ##### 

  

    

66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock and any Voting
Parity Preferred Stock (subject to the last paragraph of this Section 8(c))
at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a
single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a
meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary
for effecting or validating: 

    

 (i) _Authorization of Senior Stock_. Any amendment or alteration of the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series [C] Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 

   

 (ii) _Amendment of Series [C] Preferred Stock_. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series [C] Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or 

   

 (iii) _Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations_. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series [C] Preferred Stock (in each case other than the mandatory exchange pursuant to Section 9), or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series [C] Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 8(c), any
increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series [C] Preferred Stock
or authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance, or an increase
in the authorized or issued amount, of any other series of Preferred Stock or
other stock of the Corporation ranking equally with and/or junior to the
Series [C] Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether
such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will
not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the special
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series [C] Preferred
Stock, taken as a whole. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 8(c) would materially and adversely affect one or more but not all series of Voting Parity Preferred Stock (including the Series [C] Preferred Stock), then only the series as are materially and adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock). 

   

 (d) _Changes for Clarification_. Without the consent of the Holders of the Series [C] Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series [C] Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, the Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series [C] Preferred Stock: 

    

 (i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or inconsistent; or 

   

 (ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series [C] Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. 

  

 (e) _Procedures for Voting and Consents_. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series [C] Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series [C] Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the Holders of shares of Series [C] Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 

   

 _Section 9\. ___Mandatory Exchange__. 

   

 (a) _Effectiveness of Exchange._ Effective as of the open of business on the Exchange Date, each outstanding share of Series [C] Preferred Stock shall, automatically and without the act of any Holder, be exchanged, out of funds legally available therefor, for an Unsecured Note having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Preference Amount of such share. On and after the Exchange Date, each outstanding share of Series [C] Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, dividends on such share shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the Holder(s) of such share shall 

      ##### 

  

    

terminate with respect to such share, other than the right to receive, upon
delivery of such share to the Corporation or its registrar, an Unsecured Note
having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Preference Amount of such
share in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _Terms of the Unsecured Notes_. Each [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Note shall: 

    

 (i) [Insert this clause (i) only for single tranche Unsecured Notes] have a stated maturity of [___];

 (iv) be redeemable, at the Corporations option, in whole or in part and from time to time, for cash, at a price equal to the Unsecured Note Redemption Price of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes to be redeemed, on any date or dates, selected by the Corporation, which date or dates shall not be before the Actual Stock Purchase Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation shall provide a notice of each such redemption to the holders of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes to be redeemed no less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days before the date of such redemption; [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: " _provided further_ that the First Tranche Unsecured Notes may be so redeemed independently of the Second Tranche Unsecured Notes, and the Second Tranche Unsecured Notes may be so redeemed independently of the First Tranche Unsecured Notes;"] 

   

 (v) constitute senior, unsecured obligations of the Corporation;

 _Section 10\. ___Remarketing and Reset Mechanics__. The terms of the Unsecured Notes shall provide for the following: 

   

 (a) _Obligation to Conduct Remarketing and Related Requirements_. 

    

 (i) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, there shall, in accordance herewith, occur, after the Exchange Date, a Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes, the Remarketing Settlement Date of which Remarketing shall occur during the First Remarketing Settlement Date Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Remarketing is a Failed Remarketing, then there shall, in accordance herewith, occur a second Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes, the Remarketing Settlement Date of which Remarketing shall occur during the Second Remarketing Settlement Date Period; _provided further_ that if such second Remarketing is a Failed Remarketing, then there shall, in accordance herewith, occur a third Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes, the Remarketing Settlement Date of which Remarketing shall occur during the Third Remarketing Settlement Date Period; _provided further_  that if such third Remarketing is a Failed Remarketing, then there shall, in accordance herewith, occur a fourth Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes, the Remarketing Settlement Date of which Remarketing shall occur during the Fourth Remarketing Settlement Date Period;  _provided further_ that if such fourth Remarketing is a Failed Remarketing, then there shall, in accordance herewith, occur a fifth Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes, the Remarketing Settlement Date of which Remarketing shall occur during the Fifth Remarketing Settlement Date Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Corporation be obligated (but the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, nonetheless elect) to conduct a Remarketing at any time when no Normal Common Equity Units are outstanding, and a Final Failed Remarketing shall be deemed not to occur (and no Put Right shall arise) if the Corporation elects, in accordance with this sentence, not to conduct a Remarketing. 

   

 (ii) [Insert this subsection for double tranche Unsecured Notes] In each Remarketing, the Component Unsecured Notes forming part of the Unsecured Notes that are to be included in such Remarketing shall be separated from such Unsecured Notes and shall be separately remarketed in such Remarketing. For avoidance of doubt, each tranche of Component Unsecured Notes may be sold to different Persons and at different prices. The closing of the purchase and sale of each tranche of Component Unsecured Notes in a Remarketing shall occur on the same Remarketing Settlement Date and shall be conditioned upon each other. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) The Corporation shall appoint a nationally recognized investment banking firm as Remarketing Agent and enter into a Remarketing Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the Applicable Stock Purchase Date. The Corporation may appoint different Remarketing Agents for Remarketings with different Applicable Stock Purchase Dates, _provided_ that the Corporation shall appoint a Remarketing Agent and cause the related Remarketing Agreement to be in effect for the period commencing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the related Applicable Stock Purchase Date and ending no earlier than the earlier of (A) such Applicable Stock Purchase Date and (B) the determination, in accordance with this Section 10, that the related Remarketing is a Successful Remarketing or Failed Remarketing. Each Remarketing Agreement shall include such terms, conditions and other provisions as the Corporation and the applicable Remarketing Agent may agree between themselves but shall in any event provide substantially to the following effect with respect to the applicable Remarketing: 

   

 (1) that such Remarketing Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a cash price for the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes to be remarketed in such Remarketing which results in gross proceeds equal to at least the sum of (I) the Remarketing Fee; (II) one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of such [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes; (III) the Interest Make-Whole of such [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes; and (IV) the product of five basis points (0.05%) and the aggregate principal amount of such [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes (such sum, the "Successful Remarketing Gross Proceeds Amount"); 

   

 (2) that, subject to and in accordance with Section 10(b), such Remarketing Agent will reset the Unsecured Note Interest Rate [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "of each tranche of Component Unsecured Notes"] in order to give effect to clause (1) above; 

   

 (3) that such Remarketing Agent will, if such Remarketing is Successful, deduct the Remarketing Fee from the gross proceeds of such Remarketing and remit any proceeds remaining after such deduction to or at the direction of the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, who will either apply such net proceeds (or will have given such Remarketing Agent instructions to remit such net proceeds in a manner that will result in their application) as follows (allocated to the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes that participated in such 

   ##### 

  

    

Remarketing on a _pro rata_ basis in proportion to their
principal amounts): 

   

 (A) to the extent such net proceeds relate to Unsecured Notes that form part of any Normal Common Equity Unit(s), to pay such net proceeds, up to the aggregate Par Proceeds Remarketing Amount of such Unsecured Notes, to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent for application in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement; and to pay the aggregate Excess Proceeds Remarketing Amount, if any, of such Unsecured Notes to the Holders of such Unsecured Notes; and 

   

 (B) to the extent such net proceeds relate to Separate Unsecured Notes, to pay such net proceeds to the Holders of such Separate Unsecured Notes; and 

   

 (4) that the Remarketing Fee for such Remarketing will be as agreed among the Corporation and such Remarketing Agent and set forth in the Remarketing Agreement. 

   

 (iv) The Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect Remarketing of the [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes as set forth in this Section 10\. In the sole judgment of the Corporation, the Corporation may elect to file, and cause to become effective, a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the sale of all [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes to be remarketed in a Remarketing, which registration statement shall be in a form that enables the Remarketing Agent to effect sales of such [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes:"Component"] Unsecured Notes in such Remarketing pursuant to such registration statement. If the Corporation shall not have so elected to file and make effective such a registration statement with respect to a Remarketing, then the Corporation and the Remarketing Agent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to effect such Remarketing pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or another available exemption from the registration and prospectus-delivery requirements of the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) _Reset of Unsecured Note Interest Rate in Connection with Remarketings_. 

    

 (i) Subject to and in accordance with this Section 10, the applicable Remarketing Agent shall, in connection with a Remarketing, reset the Unsecured Note Interest Rate [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "of each tranche of Component Unsecured Notes (which reset Unsecured Note Interest Rates need not, but may, be equal to 

   ##### 

  

    

each other)"] to a new rate (the "Reset Rate"), rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth of one percent (0.001%) per annum, and [Insert for double
tranche Unsecured Notes: "each"] such Reset Rate shall, if such Remarketing
is Successful, apply to all [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes:
"Unsecured Notes"] [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component
Unsecured Notes of the applicable tranche"] (whether or not such [Insert for
double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes were included in
such Remarketing) from, and including, the Remarketing Settlement Date of
such Remarketing; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

   

 (1) if the Applicable Stock Purchase Date corresponding to such Remarketing is not the Fourth Delayed Stock Purchase Date, then [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes: "the Reset Rate shall in no event"] [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "none of the Reset Rates for such Remarketing shall"] exceed a rate per annum equal to the Reset Cap; 

   

 (2) if such Applicable Stock Purchase Date is the Fourth Delayed Stock Purchase Date, then the Reset Cap shall not apply to [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes: "the"] [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "any"] Reset Rate for such Remarketing; and 

   

 (3) [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes: "the Reset Rate shall in no event"] [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "none of the Reset Rates shall"] be less than zero percent (0%) per annum in connection with such Remarketing. 

   

 (ii) If a Remarketing is Successful, then the applicable Remarketing Agent shall, no later than 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Remarketing Settlement Date for such Remarketing, notify the Corporation and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent that such Remarketing was Successful and the [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes: "Reset Rate"] [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Reset Rates"] for such Remarketing. 

   

 (iii) If a Remarketing is not Successful and is not a Final Failed Remarketing, then: 

   

 (1) no [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes shall be sold in such Remarketing; 

   

 (2) [Insert for single tranche Unsecured Notes: "the Unsecured Note Interest Rate shall not"] [Insert for double tranche 

   ##### 

  

    

Unsecured Notes: "none of the Unsecured Note Interest Rates shall"] be
changed in connection with such Remarketing (it being understood that the
Unsecured Note Interest Rate[Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "s"]
may, in accordance with the provisions hereof, be changed in connection with
a subsequent Remarketing that is Successful); and 

   

 (3) the Corporation and the applicable Remarketing Agent shall attempt another Remarketing in accordance with, and subject to, Section 10(a)(i). 

   

 (iv) If a Remarketing is a Final Failed Remarketing, then: 

   

 (1) no [Insert for double tranche Unsecured Notes: "Component"] Unsecured Notes shall be sold in such Remarketing;

 (a) Holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds or property legally available therefor under Delaware law, non-cumulative dividends and distributions, if any, in the amount, kind and manner set forth in Section 5(b). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in Section 5(b) or in Section 6, Holders shall not be entitled to any other dividends or distributions on the Series [B] Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) dividends and distributions on the Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative; (ii) Holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors; and (iii) no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend or distribution not so declared. 

  

 (b) If the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors declares a dividend, or the Corporation otherwise makes any distribution, on all outstanding shares of Common Stock, of cash, securities (including, without limitation, rights, warrants, options or evidences of indebtedness) or other property or assets (in each case excluding Non-Partial Common Stock Distributions and Reorganization Events) (such a dividend or distribution, a "Common Stock Distribution," and the cash, securities, property or assets dividended or distributed on the Common Stock pursuant to such Common Stock Distribution, subject to the last sentence of Section 10(c), the "Distributed Property," and the date such Distributed Property is paid to holders of Common Stock pursuant to such Common Stock Distribution, the "Common Stock Distribution Date," and the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such Common Stock Distribution, the "Common Stock Distribution Record Date"), then the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall, in accordance with this Section 5(b), declare to be paid, or cause there to be distributed, to the Holders of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, Distributed Property in accordance with this Section 5(b). The date on which such Distributed Property is to be paid to Holders of the Series [B] Preferred Stock on account of such Common Stock Distribution shall be the Common Stock Distribution Date, and the kind and amount of Distributed Property to be dividended or distributed per share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be the kind and amount of Distributed Property that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Common Stock Distribution Record Date for such Common Stock Distribution would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such Common Stock Distribution. The Corporation shall not declare any Common Stock Distribution unless the Corporation has funds legally available to comply, and complies, with this Section 5(b) with respect to such Common Stock Distribution. For avoidance of doubt, no dividend or distribution shall be payable on the Series [B] Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5(b) unless there shall occur a Common Stock Distribution. For avoidance of doubt, if (1) in connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors declares a dividend, or the Corporation otherwise makes any distribution, on all outstanding shares of Common Stock and (2) in connection with such Reorganization Event, the Common Stock is 

   ##### 

  

    

converted into or exchanged for, or constitutes solely the right to receive,
cash, securities or other property, then (x) such dividend or distribution
shall be subject to this  Section 5(b) but not to Section 10(d) and (y) such
conversion into, exchange for or right to receive cash, securities or other
property shall be subject to Section 10(d) but not to this  Section 5(b). 

  

 (c) Dividends or distributions that are payable on Series [B] Preferred Stock on a Common Stock Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5(b) on account of a Common Stock Distribution will be payable to holders of record of Series [B] Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation at the close of business on the date (each such date, a "Record Date") that is the Common Stock Distribution Record Date for such Common Stock Distribution. 

  

 (d) If the Mandatory Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series [B] Preferred Stock is on or prior to a Record Date for a dividend or distribution on the Series [B] Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5(b), then the Holder of such share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not have the right to receive such dividend or distribution. If the Mandatory Conversion Date with respect to any share of Series [B] Preferred Stock is after a Record Date for a dividend or distribution on the Series [B] Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5(b) but on or prior to the date such dividend or distribution is to be made, then the Holder of such share of Series [B] Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Record Date shall have the right to receive such dividend or distribution notwithstanding such conversion. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Certificate of Designations, dividends and distributions will be deemed to have been declared and paid in full on the Series [B] Preferred Stock during a calendar quarter or any other period if there exists no Common Stock Distribution whose Common Stock Distribution Date occurs during such calendar quarter or period, as applicable. 

  

 _Section 6\. ___Liquidation Rights__. 

  

 (a) _Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, per share of Series [B] Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof legally available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, and after satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to creditors of the Corporation, before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Junior Stock, in full an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference Amount per share, together with all dividends (if any) that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution. 

  

 (b) _Partial Payment_. If, in any distribution described in Section 6(a) above, the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preferences in full to all holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, then the amounts paid to the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock 

   ##### 

  

    

and to the holders of all such other Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata in
accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preferences of
the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock and the holders of all such other
Parity Stock. In any such distribution, the "Liquidation Preference" of any
holder of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise
payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the
assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including any
declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other
than Series [B] Preferred Stock and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative
basis, any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as
applicable). 

  

 (c) _Residual Distributions_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, if the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock and Senior Stock, then the Holders shall (subject to the rights of any other series of Preferred Stock that is not Junior Stock to similarly be treated as holders of Common Stock) thereafter be treated as holders of Common Stock, determined as if each share of Series [B] Preferred Stock were converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 

  

 (d) _Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation_. For purposes of this Section 6, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. 

  

 _Section 7\. ___No Redemption__. The Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable at the election of the Corporation. 

  

 _Section 8\. ___Maturity__. The Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be perpetual unless converted in accordance herewith. 

  

 _Section 9\. ___Voting Rights__. 

  

 (a) _General_. The Holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by law. 

  

 (b) _Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events_. If and whenever dividends on any shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock that are required, pursuant to Section 5(b), to be declared and paid have not been so declared and paid for at least six (6) calendar quarters, whether or not consecutive (a "Nonpayment Event"), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two (2) and the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock, together with the holders of any outstanding shares of Dividend Parity Stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of a total of two (2) additional directors ("Voting Parity Preferred Stock"), 

   ##### 

  

    

voting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two
(2) additional directors (the "Preferred Stock Directors"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, as a condition to exercising such right to so elect such
Preferred Stock Directors, the election of no such Preferred Stock Director
shall cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of
the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which its securities
may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent
directors. 

  

 If the Holders of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, and such other holders of Voting Parity Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to vote for the election of the Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, then such directors shall be initially elected following such Nonpayment Event only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least twenty percent (20%) of the Series [B] Preferred Stock or of any other such series of Voting Parity Preferred Stock then outstanding, and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation at which time such Nonpayment Event shall be continuing. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment Event shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock or Voting Parity Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, or as may otherwise be required by law. 

  

 When dividends have been paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) in full on the Series [B] Preferred Stock for at least four (4) calendar quarters (whether or not consecutive) after a Nonpayment Event, then (1) such Nonpayment Event shall be deemed to have ceased; (2) the number of calendar quarters in which dividends have not been declared and paid shall, for purposes of this Section 9, be reset to zero (0); (3) the right of the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors on account of such Nonpayment Event shall cease (but subject always to revesting of such voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment Event pursuant to this Section 9); (4) the terms of office of all the Preferred Stock Directors shall forthwith terminate; and (5) the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly. For avoidance of doubt, "full" dividends on the Series [B] Preferred Stock shall in no event include any arrearage, or any dividends that would accrue on unpaid dividends or distributions, had dividends on the Series [B] Preferred Stock been cumulative. 

  

 Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series [B] Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Preferred Stock, when they have the voting rights set forth above in this Section 9 (voting together as a single class). So long as a Nonpayment Event shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election of Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment Event) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series [B] Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Preferred Stock, when they have the voting rights set forth above in this  Section 9 (voting together as a single class). Each such vote of stockholders to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director 

   ##### 

  

    

must be taken only at a special meeting of such stockholders, called in the
same manner as provided above for the initial election of Preferred Stock
Directors after a Nonpayment Event. The Preferred Stock Directors shall each
be entitled to one (1) vote per director on any matter that shall come before
the Board of Directors for a vote. Each Preferred Stock Director shall hold
office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal, if such office shall not have
previously terminated as above provided. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 9(b) shall have no force and effect (and, for all purposes, shall be deemed not to be included in this Certificate of Designations) at any time when no shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other U.S. national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed. 

  

 (c) _Other Voting Rights_. So long as any shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 

   

 (i) _Amendment of Series [B] Preferred Stock_. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation so as to increase the number of authorized shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock or materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or 

   

 (ii) _Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations_. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series [B] Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another corporation or other entity, unless in each case either (A) such binding share exchange or reclassification constitutes a Reorganization Event and the Corporation complies with Section 10(d) with respect to such Reorganization Event; or (B) the shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock remain outstanding and have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series [B] Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 9(c), any
increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series [B] Preferred Stock
or authorized Preferred Stock, or the creation and issuance, or an increase
in the authorized or issued amount, of any other series of Preferred Stock or
other stock of the Corporation ranking senior to, equally with 

  ##### 

  

   

and/or junior to the Series [B] Preferred Stock with respect to the payment
of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or
the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the special
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series [B] Preferred
Stock, taken as a whole, and each Holder, by its acceptance of any shares of
Series [B] Preferred Stock, is, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
deemed to consent, and authorize the Corporation, the Board of Directors and
any committee of the Board of Directors, to take any action to effect any such
increase, creation or issuance. 

   

 In addition, so long as any shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at a majority of the shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock then outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting a publicly announced tender offer by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that such vote or consent shall not be required if the Corporation grants Holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock of the right to participate, based on the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Series [B] Preferred Stock is convertible, in such tender offer on the same terms and conditions as holders of Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _Changes for Clarification_. Without the consent of the Holders of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, the Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series [B] Preferred Stock: 

   

 (i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or inconsistent; or 

   

 (ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series [B] Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. 

  

 (e) _Procedures for Voting and Consents_. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series [B] Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series [B] Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or 

   ##### 

  

    

consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the
shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Preferred Stock
has been cast or given on any matter on which the Holders of shares of Series
[B] Preferred Stock are entitled to vote shall be determined by the
Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts of the shares
voted or covered by the consent. 

  

 _Section 10\. ___Mandatory Conversion__. 

  

 (a) _Effectiveness of Conversion._ If the Corporation shall have obtained the Stockholder Approval, then, effective as of the open of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date, each outstanding share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall, automatically and without the act of any Holder, be converted into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect as of the open of business on the Mandatory Conversion Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series [B] Preferred Stock and shall instead deliver a check in an amount equal to the value of such fraction computed on the basis of the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately before the Mandatory Conversion Date. All shares of Common Stock issued or delivered upon conversion of the Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free of preemptive or similar rights and (except, in the case of Series [B] Preferred Stock pledged pursuant to the Indemnification Security Agreement, as provided in the Indemnification Security Agreement) free of any lien or adverse claim created by the Corporation. If more than one share of Series [B] Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, then the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock so surrendered. 

  

 (b) _Effect of Conversion_. Subject to the second sentence of Section 5(d), on and after the Mandatory Conversion Date each outstanding share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, dividends and distributions on such share shall cease to accrue or be due, and all rights of the Holder(s) of such share shall terminate with respect to such share, other than the right to receive, upon delivery of the certificate(s) evidencing such share to the Corporation or its registrar, certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series [B] Preferred Stock has been converted, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, as provided herein. 

  

 (c) _Adjustment to the Conversion Rate_. If, after the date of original issue of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, the Corporation: (A) pays a dividend or makes another distribution on Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock payable, in whole or in part, in shares of Common Stock; (B) subdivides or splits the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; or (C) combines or reclassifies the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment by the number of shares of Common Stock which a person who owns only one (1) share of Common Stock immediately before the record 

   ##### 

  

    

date or effective date, as applicable, of such dividend, distribution,
subdivision, split, or combination or reclassification and who is entitled to
participate in such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split,
combination or reclassification would own immediately after giving effect to
such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination or
reclassification (without giving effect to any arrangement pursuant to such
dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination or reclassification
not to issue fractional shares of Common Stock). Such adjustment shall become
effective immediately after the close of business on such record date, in the
case of a stock dividend or stock distribution, and shall become effective at
the open of business on such effective date, in the case of a subdivision,
split, combination or reclassification. For avoidance of doubt, if, after the
date of original issue of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, the Corporation
pays a dividend or makes another distribution on Common Stock to all holders
of Common Stock payable, in part (and not exclusively), in shares of Common
Stock (such a dividend or distribution, a "Partial Common Stock
Distribution"), then, without duplication, (i) an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this  Section 10(c) on account of
the portion (and only such portion) of such Partial Common Stock Distribution
paid in shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the portion of such Partial Common
Stock Distribution (and only such portion) not paid in shares of Common Stock
shall be subject to  Section 5(b). If, after the date of original issue of
the Series [B] Preferred Stock, the Corporation makes a Partial Common Stock
Distribution, then the Distributed Property of such Partial Common Stock
Distribution shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed not to include the
portion of such Partial Common Stock Distribution that is paid in shares of
Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _Conversion Upon Reorganization Event_. If, after the date of original issue of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, (1) there occurs (A) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person; (B) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (C) any statutory exchange of securities of the Corporation with another Person or any binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a transaction that is subject to  Section 10(c)); or (D) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (any such event in clauses (A) through (D), inclusive, a "Reorganization Event"); and (2) pursuant to such Reorganization, the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for, or constitutes solely the right to receive, cash, securities or other property, then, immediately after the effective time of such Reorganization Event, the Corporation shall make provision for each outstanding share of Series [B] Preferred Stock to be converted, out of funds legally available therefor, into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property (collectively, "Reference Property") receivable pursuant to such Reorganization Event by a holder (the "Representative Holder") of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect at such effective time, which holder (A) is not a Person with which the Corporation consolidated or into which the Corporation merged or which merged into the Corporation or to which such sale, transfer, lease or conveyance was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person, to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Corporation 

   ##### 

  

    

and non-Affiliates, and (B) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any,
as to the kind or amount of such Reference Property ( _provided_ that if the
kind or amount of such Reference Property is not the same for each share of
Common Stock held by a Person (other than a Constituent Person or
an Affiliate thereof) who has not exercised such rights of election ("Non-
Electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section 10(d), the kind and
amount of Reference Property in respect of each Non-Electing Share shall be
deemed to be the weighted average of the kinds and amounts of
Reference Property receivable per share of Common Stock pursuant to such
Reorganization Event in respect of all 
Non-Electing Shares). On and after the effective time of a Reorganization
Event, each outstanding share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall cease to be
outstanding, dividends on such share shall cease to accrue, and all rights of
the Holder(s) of such share shall terminate with respect to such share, other
than the right to receive the kind and amount of Reference Property into
which such share of Series [B] Preferred Stock has been converted. 

  

 (e) _Conversion at Corporation s Election_. If, after the date of original issue of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, the Corporation or its successor shall have consummated a tender offer or exchange offer for, or shall have repurchased, in each case whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions, more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock initially issued hereunder, then, subject to any applicable requirements of the exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed and subject to applicable law, the Corporation may elect to have the provisions of Section 10(a) apply as if the Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained on a date of the Corporations choosing, which date cannot be earlier than the consummation of such tender offer, exchange offer or repurchase. 

  

 (f) _Notice of Adjustments_. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 10(c), the Corporation shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the occurrence of the event that requires such adjustment, (i) compute the adjusted Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 10(c); and (ii) cause the Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation (or a designee of such Chief Financial Officer) to prepare and mail to each Holder, at such Holders last address shown on the records of the Corporation, a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. 

  

 (g) _Reservation of Common Stock._ The Corporation shall, at all times when any shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock are outstanding, reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Corporation may, at its election, deliver, upon conversion of the Series [B] Preferred Stock, treasury shares of Common Stock or other shares of Common Stock that the Corporation has reacquired, provided such shares comply with the second sentence of Section 10(a). 

  

 _Section 11\. ___Record Holders__. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series [B] Preferred Stock 

   ##### 

  

    

may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series [B] Preferred
Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the
Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary. 

  

 _Section 12\. ___Notices__. All notices or communications in respect of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designations, in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or by applicable law. 

  

 _Section 13\. ___No Preemptive Rights__. No share of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 

  

 _Section 14\. ___Other Rights__. The shares of Series [B] Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.
