Event that gave rise to such Loss Amount, so that after taking into account such Tax Adjustments

Indemnity Event ) under this Agreement at any time be reduced below zero (0)&nbsp;as a result of the Tax
Adjustments. An &#147;<U>Indemnity Event</U>&#148; shall mean (x)&nbsp;the specific item, event, circumstance,
failure to act or other situation that gave rise to the claim for indemnity, and (y)&nbsp;the receipt or
accrual of the indemnity payment. Once finally determined in accordance with the provisions of
this <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(f)</U>, the Tax Adjustments with respect to an Indemnity Event (including all
related adjustments made with respect to such event) shall not be redetermined based on the failure
of any of the assumptions or projections used in determining such Tax Adjustments actually to come

resulting from the occurrence of an Indemnity Event shall take into account (1)&nbsp;the current
and prior Tax benefits and Tax detriments, and (2)&nbsp;the present value of all reasonably
anticipated future Tax benefits and Tax detriments, to an indemnitee, any Affiliate of the
indemnitee to the extent such Affiliate realizes or is reasonably anticipated to realize a
Tax benefit or Tax detriment as result of the Indemnity Event, and any Tax benefits or Tax
detriments resulting from an Indemnity Event that are realized or reasonably anticipated to
be realized by any consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group of which the
indemnitee or Affiliate is a member at the relevant time, subject to all limitations or
restrictions that may be imposed by Law on such realization. In calculating the future Tax
benefits and future Tax detriments resulting from an Indemnity Event, such Tax benefits and
Tax detriments shall be projected until such time as no material Tax benefits or Tax
detriments are expected to remain. Such calculation shall use and be based upon (A)&nbsp;the
assumptions and projections used for purposes of preparing the indemnitee&#146;s and its
Affiliates&#146; business projections actually used by such Persons in conducting their business,
(B)&nbsp;for periods, if any, not covered by (A), the assumptions and projections used for
purposes of preparing the indemnitee&#146;s and its Affiliates&#146; cashflow testing analyses
contained in actuarial memoranda prepared in support of such entities&#146; regulatory financial
statements for the relevant periods, and (C)&nbsp;for periods, if any, not covered by (A)&nbsp;or (B),
the indemnitee&#146;s and its Affiliates&#146; good faith estimates using, to the extent relevant,
reasonable extrapolations of the assumptions, projections and methodologies employed in (A)
and (B) (the &#147;<U>Assumed Financial Projections</U>&#148;). The Tax benefits and Tax detriments
over the period covered by the Assumed Financial Projections plus any relevant prior periods
shall be determined by comparing (Y)&nbsp;the amount of Taxes that the indemnitee, any relevant
Affiliate and any relevant consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group would have
paid and would have been reasonably anticipated to pay in the absence of the occurrence of
the Indemnity Event to (Z)&nbsp;the amount of Taxes that the indemnitee, any relevant Affiliate
and any relevant consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group would have paid and are

benefits and Tax detriments are reasonably anticipated to be realized. The future

parties acting reasonably and in good faith, no less than 60&nbsp;days prior to the date on which
the relevant indemnity payment is otherwise due, the indemnitee shall provide the indemnitor
a reasonably detailed calculation of the adjustments required under <U>Section

indemnitee&#146;s calculation of the adjustments required under <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(f)(i)</U>
included in the Tax Benefits &#038; Detriments Notice, the indemnitor shall provide written
notice of its objection (including a reasonably detailed calculation of the adjustments the
indemnitor reasonably believes are required under <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(f)(i)</U>) to the
indemnitee no later than forty-five (45 ) days (plus any extension thereof that is agreed
by the parties acting reasonably and in good faith) after receipt of (A)&nbsp;the Tax Benefits &#038;

Firm may reasonably request further relevant information after the expiration of such thirty
(30)&nbsp;day period but neither such request nor the receipt of information pursuant to such
request shall extend the Review Period. To the extent that the parties cannot agree on the
amount of the adjustments required under <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(f)(i)</U>, the disputed items
shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed by the parties (the
&#147;<U>Independent Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). Such firm shall decide as promptly as practicable,
but in all events (unless otherwise agreed by the parties, acting reasonably and in good
faith) within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days of the time after the indemnitee and the Indemnitor
Accounting Firm have presented their final positions regarding the amount of the adjustments
required under <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(f)(i)</U>, whether the position of the indemnitee or the
indemnitor is more correct. The cost of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally between the parties and the determination of such accounting firm shall be binding
on the parties. In the event that a court is determining or has determined the Loss Amount
and is also determining or has determined the adjustment to such Loss Amount to determine
the &#147;after tax basis&#148; of such Loss Amount, then the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(iii)</U>
(other than this sentence) and <U>Section&nbsp;8.07(iv)</U> shall not apply and the adjustment
as set forth in a determination by such a court that is final and no longer subject to

the parties as to such adjustment.

Party with a written &#147;<U>Notice of Dispute</U>&#148;, describing the nature of the Dispute, and the
Dispute shall be escalated to the members of senior management at the Acquiror and the Parent set
forth in <U>Schedule 7.09(a)</U> for resolution in good faith. In the event such senior
executives fail to meet, or if they meet, fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days

Days and confer in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute. If the senior administrative
executives, or their respective designees fail to resolve the Dispute within five (5)&nbsp;Business
Days, the Parties shall retain all rights under applicable Law and this Agreement with respect to
such Dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in Section&nbsp;7.09(b), the procedures set forth in this
Section&nbsp;7.09(a) must be satisfied as a condition precedent to a Party commencing any legal
proceeding, and a Party&#146;s failure to comply with such procedures shall constitute cause for the
dismissal without prejudice of any such legal proceeding.

statements filed with the state of domicile (the &#147;<U>Statutory Financial Statements</U>&#148;)

according to Section&nbsp;2.07 (e)&nbsp;of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company prepares the
Actual Closing Statutory Financial Statements, such Actual Closing Statutory Financial
Statements should be used for RBC calculation and any statutory information necessary to
prepare RBC at the quarterly level of detail as specified herein will be obtained from the
records and work papers used in the preparation of the Actual Closing Statutory Financial
Statements. In order to prepare the estimated RBC at the Closing as specified in Section
2.07 (b)(ii) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, approximate methods may be used provided that
such method shall start from the latest Statutory Financial Statements brought forward by a
combination of most recent Standard Internal (&#147;<U>SI</U>&#148;) information; also ledger

account value liability and assets backing it will be treated as a separate account for RBC
