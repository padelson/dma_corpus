Certificate     -iv-  9   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 1,
2000, is among Developers Diversified Realty Corporation, an Ohio corporation
("Parent"), DDR Transitory Sub Inc., a Texas corporation ("Buyer"), and
American Industrial Properties REIT, a Texas real estate investment
trust ("Seller").   RECITALS:   A. The Boards of Directors of Buyer and
Parent and the Board of Trust Managers of Seller (the "Board of Managers,"
and each individually, a "Board Manager") consider it advisable, subject to
the conditions and other provisions contained herein, that Buyer shall merge
with and into Seller (the "Merger").   B. Upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Buyer and Seller shall execute Articles of Merger
(collectively, the "Articles of Merger") in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit "A" and shall file such Articles of Merger in accordance
with Texas law to effectuate the Merger.   C. Seller has received a fairness
opinion relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as more fully
described herein.   D. Parent, Buyer and Seller desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.   E. Parent and Buyer are unwilling to
enter into this Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, certain institutional holders of Seller\'s issued
and outstanding common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.10 per
share ("Trust Common Shares"), enter into agreements (the "Holders\'
Agreements") providing for certain actions relating to the Trust Common
Shares owned by them, and such holders have entered into the Holders\'
Agreements.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER  
1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with Section 23.40 of the Texas Real
Estate Investment Trust Act (the "REIT Act"), Parent shall contribute all of
its Trust Common Shares into Buyer and then Buyer shall be merged with and
into Seller, with Seller as the surviving real estate investment trust (the
"Surviving Company"). The name of the Surviving Company will be American
Industrial Properties REIT.    10   1.2 Closing. The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the later of (i) January 31, 2001
or (ii) within two (2) business days after the date on which the last to be
satisfied of the conditions in Article 6 is satisfied or waived, provided,
however, if all of the conditions are satisfied or waived prior to the Seller
Shareholders Meeting (as defined below) immediately following the meeting
(the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Locke Liddell and Sapp, 2200 Ross
Avenue, Suite 2200, Dallas, Texas 75201, unless another date and time or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties.   1.3 Effective Time. As soon
as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 6, the parties shall execute and file the Articles of
Merger, in accordance with Texas law, and shall make all other filings and
recordings required under Texas law. The Merger shall become effective at
such time ("Effective Time") as the Articles of Merger are accepted by both
the County Clerk in Dallas County, Texas, and the Secretary of State of the
State of Texas, or at such time as Buyer and Seller shall agree should be
specified in the Articles of Merger (not to exceed thirty (30) days after the
Articles of Merger are accepted for record). Unless otherwise agreed, the
parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.   1.4
Effect of Merger on Declaration of Trust and Bylaws. The Third Amended and
Restated Declaration of Trust (the "Trust Declaration") of Seller and the
Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws of Seller (the "Bylaws"), as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue in full force
and effect after the Merger until further amended in accordance with
applicable Texas law.   1.5 Board of Managers and Officers. The board of
trust managers of the Surviving Company shall consist of Scott A. Wolstein,
James A. Schoff, Robert H. Gidel and Albert T. Adams, and those persons shall
continue to serve for the balance of their unexpired terms or their earlier
death, resignation or removal. Seller shall cause all other members of the
Board of Managers of Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time to submit
their resignations as Board Managers on or prior to the Closing Date.
Immediately prior to the Closing, all officers of Seller shall resign and all
officers and directors of all Seller Subsidiaries shall resign.   1.6
Effect on Shares. Subject to Section 1.7, as of the Effective
Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of the following securities or any party hereto:   (a)
Each common share, $0.01 par value, of Buyer (the "Buyer Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Trust Common Share of the
Surviving Company (the "Surviving Company Shares"). Certificates which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Buyer Shares
shall thereafter be deemed to represent the same number of Surviving Company
Shares. The Surviving Company shall issue new certificates representing
Surviving Company Shares to the shareholders of Buyer on a pro rata basis in
accordance with their respective shares of Buyer upon surrender to the
Surviving Company of share certificates formerly representing Buyer
Shares.   (b) Each Trust Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by any direct or indirect
Seller Subsidiary or in the treasury
of   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 2  11  Seller, shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist. Each
Trust Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by Parent, Buyer or any of their respective direct or indirect
subsidiaries shall be contributed to Seller and become treasury shares of
Seller, which shall be canceled in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.   (c) Each Trust Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than those shares referred to
in Section 1.6(b) and in Section 1.7, shall, subject to Section 5.8, be
converted automatically into the right to receive $13.74 in cash (or such
greater amount as determined in accordance with the last paragraph of Section
6.2(m)) (the "Common Consideration"). If Seller makes a distribution or pays
to the holders of Trust Common Shares or declares a dividend other than the
Final Dividend (as defined in Section 1.9(a)), the Common Consideration
payable to holders of Trust Common Shares in the Merger shall be reduced by
the amount derived by dividing the aggregate amount of such dividends and
distributions by the number of Trust Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
Trust Common Shares held, directly or indirectly, by Parent).   (d) Each
certificate previously representing Trust Common Shares, other than shares
referred to in Section 1.6(b) or in Section 1.7, shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Common Consideration in accordance with Section
1.6(c) plus any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares represented
thereby. The holders of certificates previously representing Trust Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to Trust Common Shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by law.   1.7 Dissenters\' Rights.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Trust Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has dissented from
the Merger in accordance with Sections 25.10, 25.20 and 25.30 of the REIT Act
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Common Consideration as provided in Section 1.6 and shall not be entitled to
any of the additional consideration provided for in Section 1.11, unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right
to payment under the REIT Act. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to such payment,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Common
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest
thereon, and shall be eligible to receive a pro rata portion of any
additional consideration payable under Section 1.11. Seller shall give Buyer
prompt notice of any notice of dissent received by Seller and, prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such dissents. Prior to the Effective Time,
Seller shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such dissents.  
1.8 Share Options and Related Matters. Each option (collectively, the "Seller
Options") granted under the Seller\'s Employee and Trust Manager Incentive
Plan, as amended (the "Seller Incentive Plan"), to a person other
than Parent, which is outstanding (whether or not then exercisable)
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or
canceled prior thereto, shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and upon
the surrender and cancellation of the option agreement representing such
Seller Option, the Surviving
Company   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 3  12  shall pay to the holder thereof at the Closing, with respect to
each canceled option, cash in an amount equal to the amount by which the
Common Consideration exceeds the option exercise price. The cash payment
shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable federal
or state withholding tax (the "Option Consideration"). Seller shall pay at
the Effective Time, to each participant having a deferral account under
Seller\'s Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Trust Managers, cash in
an amount equal to the value of his deferral account.   1.9 Exchange of
Certificates; Pre-Closing Dividends; Fractional Shares.   (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Seller\'s transfer agent shall act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) if the
Closing occurs after the Anticipated Closing Date (as defined in Section
6.2(m)), to the extent such dividend would not cause Seller to fail to
satisfy the condition set forth in Section 6.2(m), Seller shall have the
right to declare a dividend in the amount per share on each Trust
Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Trust Common Shares held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent) equal to the amount of cash generated by operations
during the period commencing on the fourth day immediately following the
Anticipated Closing Date and ending at the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (such amount to be certified in
writing to Parent and Buyer by Seller\'s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer) divided by the number of Trust Common Shares issued and
outstanding on the record date for such dividend or distribution (including,
without limitation, the Trust Common Shares held, directly or indirectly, by
Parent) (the "Final Dividend"), and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the
aggregate amount required to pay the Final Dividend on each Trust Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Trust Common Shares held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent), and (ii) Seller, Buyer and Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.9,
the aggregate Common Consideration to be paid to Seller\'s shareholders,
excluding the holders of those shares referred to in Section 1.6(b) and in
Section 1.7. The aggregate amount deposited by Seller and Buyer under this
Section 1.9(a) is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange
Fund." Seller shall fund the amount required to pay the Final Dividend solely
from the cash generated by operations described above and shall not fund any
portion of that amount, directly or indirectly, through borrowings.
Seller shall retain the net cash proceeds from the sale of the Manhattan
Towers Properties (except to the extent such proceeds must be distributed
to shareholders to prevent Seller from having to pay federal income tax) and
the Lend Lease Properties, and the Net Other Assets amounts for the deposit
required under clause (ii) above, and shall include those net cash proceeds
in the deposit made pursuant to clause (ii). If such deposited amounts are
insufficient to pay in full the Common Consideration, Parent will fund the
deficiency or Parent will cause the Surviving Company to fund such deficiency
by drawing down from the Surviving Company \'s available line of credit (any
associated costs to be borne by Parent and Buyer), and such amount as is
necessary to cover any deficiency shall be deposited with the Exchange
Agent.   (b) Promptly, and in any event within two (2) business days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Trust Common Shares ("Certificates") (except
holders of those shares referred to in Section 1.6(b) and in Section 1.7) (i)
a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and
risk   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 4  13  of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates duly endorsed to the Exchange Agent and in such
form and with such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
receiving the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common Consideration in respect
thereof. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for
cancellation together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the amount of the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common
Consideration to which such holder shall be entitled, after giving effect to
any required withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
be canceled forthwith. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Trust
Common Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of Seller,
checks for the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common Consideration to which
the registered holder shall be entitled may be issued and paid to the
applicable transferee if the Certificate representing such Trust Common
Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall (x) pay to the administrator of Seller\'s Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "DRIP") or to one or more persons designated by such administrator, an
amount equal to the product of (1) the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common
Consideration and (2) the number of Trust Common Shares held in the DRIP as
of the Effective Time, and (y) make appropriate arrangements for the
immediate payment of the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common Consideration
to the beneficial owners of any Trust Common Shares that are held in book-
entry or other electronic form and for which at the Effective Time there is
no Certificate representing the ownership thereof.   (c) At and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of any Trust Common Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Final Dividend (if any) and the Common Consideration in
accordance with this Section 1.9.   (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Trust Common Shares two (2) years after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any former holder of Trust
Common Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of the Final
Dividend (if any) and the Common Consideration, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. None of Parent, Buyer, Seller,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder
of Trust Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by
such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company will
issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Final Dividend (if any) and the Common
Consideration.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 5  14   1.10 Right to Receive Dividends. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any holder of Trust Common Shares who, on
the date of the surrender of a Certificate, has not received any dividend or
other distribution with respect to such shares with a declared record date on
or prior to the date of such surrender shall nevertheless be entitled to
receive any such dividend or distribution on the later of the date of such
surrender or the payment date of such dividend or distribution.   1.11
Additional Merger Consideration. If at any time during the first six months
following the Closing Date, Buyer sells all or substantially all of the
properties listed on Exhibit B hereto (the "DDR Properties") for a net amount
greater than the agreed-upon aggregate values of the DDR Properties set forth
on Exhibit B, then the Allocable Portion (as defined below) of such
incremental proceeds shall be paid into a trust created for the benefit of
the Non-Parent Shareholders (as defined below). The funds, if any, held in
such trust shall be distributed not later than nine months after the Closing
Date to the Non-Parent Shareholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with
their respective holdings of Trust Common Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time. "Allocable Portion" means the amount derived by multiplying
the amount of such incremental proceeds from the sale of the DDR Properties
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Trust Common Shares
held by the Non-Parent Shareholders immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the denominator of which is the total number of Trust Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. "Non-
Parent Shareholders" means all holders of Trust Common Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time except for Parent, Buyer, any other direct or
indirect Parent subsidiary, and any holder of Trust Common Shares entitled to
payment therefor under the REIT Act in accordance with Section 1.7
hereof.    ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER  
Seller hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Buyer as follows:   2.1

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or

Page 6  15  its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for any jurisdiction in which any failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. As
used in this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of Seller and the Subsidiaries (to the extent of Seller\'s
interests therein), taken as a whole; provided, however, that any Action
brought by a shareholder of Seller or in the name of or on behalf of Seller
relating to this Agreement, the Merger, the sale by Seller of its Manhattan
Towers Properties (the "Manhattan Towers Transaction") or the transaction to
be consummated pursuant to the Lend Lease Agreement (as defined in Section
2.4 below) (the "Lend Lease Transaction") shall be deemed not to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Schedule 2.1(d) sets forth the name of each
Subsidiary (whether owned directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries). All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each of the Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned, directly or indirectly,
by Seller free and clear of all Liens, except as set forth in Schedule
2.1(d). As used in this Agreement, "Liens" means all liens, mortgages, deeds
of trust, deeds to secure debt, security interests, pledges, claims, charges,
easements and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. The following
information for each Subsidiary is set forth in Schedule 2.1(d), to the
extent applicable: (i) its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization; (ii) the type of and percentage interest held by Seller in the
Subsidiary and the names of and percentage interest held by the other
interest holders, if any, in the Subsidiary; and (iii) any loans from Seller
to, or payments payable to Seller from, the Subsidiary, and the rate of
interest thereon.   2.2 Authority Relative to Agreements; Board
Approval.   (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and of all of the documents and instruments delivered in connection
herewith by Seller are within Seller\'s power. Subject to the receipt of the
requisite approval of Seller\'s shareholders and assuming this Agreement and
such other documents and instruments constitute binding obligations of Buyer
and Parent, this Agreement is, and the other documents and instruments
required to be entered into hereunder will be, when executed and delivered by
Seller, the valid and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against
Seller in accordance with their respective terms subject only to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws at the time in effect
affecting the enforceability or right of creditors generally and to general
equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).   (b) A majority of the Board of
Managers not designated by Parent has approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Texas
law, and has determined to recommend that the shareholders of Seller vote in
favor of and approve the Merger.   (c) Neither the consummation of the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement, nor (i) consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Lend Lease Transaction or (ii) consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Manhattan Towers Transaction, will give any
person the right to demand payment for that shareholder\'s shares under the
laws of the
State   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 7  16  of Texas, under the Trust Declaration, or otherwise, except for
holders of Trust Common Shares who dissent from the Merger pursuant to and in
accordance with the REIT Act.   2.3 Capital Stock.   (a) Seller\'s
authorized capital stock on the date hereof consists of 500,000,000 Trust
Common Shares, and 50,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.10
par value. As of the date hereof, there are 20,992,195 Trust Common Shares
issued and outstanding, and no preferred shares issued and outstanding. All
such issued and outstanding Trust Common Shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights except those
granted by contracts identified on Schedule 2.3(a). Seller has no outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
the holders of which have the right to vote) with the shareholders of Seller
on any matter. Other than (i) the limited partnership units ("Partnership
Units") described in Schedule 2.3(a) to this Agreement which may be put to
Seller or any Subsidiary by the holders thereof for Trust Common Shares or
the cash equivalent thereof (at the option of Seller), (ii) options subject
to grant under the option plans described in Schedules 2.3(a) and (b) of this
Agreement, or (iii) as described in Schedule 2.3(c) to this Agreement, there
are no existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which
obligate Seller or any Subsidiary to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of Seller.   (b) Except as
described in Schedule 2.3(a), no Subsidiary has issued Partnership Units or
granted securities convertible into interests in Seller or in any Subsidiary
and no Subsidiary is a party to any outstanding commitment of any kind
relating to, or any presently effective agreement or understanding with
respect to, interests in Seller or in any Subsidiary, whether issued or
unissued.   (c) Except for Seller\'s interests in the Subsidiaries or
as described in Schedule 2.1(d), none of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries
owns directly or indirectly any interest or investment (whether equity or
debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint business, trust or other legal
entity (other than investments in short-term investment securities).   2.4
No Conflicts; No Defaults; Required Filings and Consents. Neither the
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement, the agreement among
Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, Inc., Seller and certain of Seller\'s
Subsidiaries (the "Lend Lease Agreement") and the agreement relating to the
sale of the Manhattan Towers property ("the Manhattan Towers Agreement"), nor
the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, will:   (a)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the Trust Declaration
or Bylaws;   (b) except as described in Schedule 2.4(b), result in a
breach or violation of, a default under, or the triggering of any payment or
other obligation pursuant to, or accelerate vesting under, any tax
protection agreement or other agreement to which Seller or any Subsidiary is
a party or by which Seller or any Subsidiary is otherwise bound, or any
Seller or
Subsidiary   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 8  17  stock option plan, option plan or similar compensation plan or
any grant or award made under any of the foregoing;   (c) violate or
conflict with any statute, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to Seller or to any of the Subsidiaries;   (d) except
as described in Schedule 2.4(d), violate or conflict with or result in a
breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or any event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result
in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties of Seller or of any of the Subsidiaries under, or
result in being declared void, voidable or without further binding effect,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust or any franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement
or other instrument, commitment or obligation to which Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their properties is bound or affected; or   (e) require any consent,
approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with,
any Government Authority (as defined below), other than the Articles of
Merger pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof and any filings required under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), state securities laws
("Blue Sky Laws") (collectively, the "Filings"), and any filings required to
be made with the Texas State Department of Assessments and Taxation, if any,
or any national securities exchange on which the Trust Common Shares
are listed.   2.5 SEC Matters and Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.  
(a) Seller has delivered or made available to Parent and Buyer the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 filed by
Seller with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, including all documents
incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Form 10-K"), and each
registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement and
all exhibits thereto prepared by Seller or relating to the Properties (as
defined in Section 2.11(a)) for filing in the three (3) years ending on the
date of this Agreement, each in the form (including exhibits and any
amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively the "Seller Reports").
The Seller Reports were filed with the SEC in a timely manner and constitute
all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by Seller under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Securities Laws"). As of their respective dates and as
amended through the date of this Agreement, the Seller Reports (other than
preliminary materials), (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading except to the extent such statements have been modified
or superseded by later filed Seller Reports. To Seller\'s knowledge, there is
no unresolved violation asserted by any Government Authority with respect to
any of the Seller Reports. As used in this Agreement, "Government Authority"
means any government or state (or any subdivision thereof) of or in
the   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 9  18  United States, or any agency, authority, bureau, commission,
department or similar body or instrumentality thereof, or any government
court or tribunal.   (b) Each of Seller\'s balance sheets included in
or incorporated by reference into the Seller Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presented the financial position of Seller as of
its date and each of the statements of operations, shareholders\' equity
(deficit) and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the
Seller Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presented
the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as the case may
be, of Seller for the period covered thereby, in each case in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently
applied during the periods involved and in accordance with Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC, except as may be noted therein and except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, for normal recurring year-end adjustments
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except as and to the extent set
forth in the Seller Reports or in any Schedule hereto, to Seller\'s
knowledge, none of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries has any material
Liabilities, nor do there exist any circumstances that would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, "Liabilities" means, as to any person, all
debts, adverse claims, liabilities and obligations, direct, indirect,
absolute or contingent of such person, whether accrued, vested or otherwise,
whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not
actually reflected, or required by GAAP to be reflected, in such person\'s
balance sheets or other books and records, including (i) obligations arising
from noncompliance with any law, rule or regulation of any Government
Authority or imposed by any court or any arbitrator of any kind, (ii) all
indebtedness or liability of such person for borrowed money, or for the
purchase price of property or services (including trade obligations), (iii)
all obligations of such person as lessee under leases, capital or other, (iv)
liabilities of such person in respect of plans covered by Title IV of ERISA,
or otherwise arising in respect of plans for employees or former employees or
their respective families or beneficiaries, (v) reimbursement obligations of
such person in respect of letters of credit, (vi) all obligations of such
person arising under acceptance facilities, (vii) all liabilities of other
persons or entities, directly or indirectly, guaranteed, endorsed (other than
for collection or deposit in the ordinary course of business) or discounted
with recourse by such person or with respect to which such person is
otherwise directly or indirectly liable, (viii) all obligations secured by
any Lien on property of such person, whether or not the obligations have been
assumed, and (ix) all other items which have been, or in accordance with GAAP
would be, included in determining total liabilities on the liability side of
such person\'s balance sheet.   2.6 Litigation; Compliance With Law.   (a)
Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.6(a), there is no action, suit,
arbitration, inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any Government
Authority (any such item, an "Action") pending or, to Seller\'s knowledge,
threatened against Seller or any of the Subsidiaries that would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, or which questions the validity of this Agreement, the Lend Lease
Agreement or the Manhattan Towers Agreement or of any action taken or to be
taken in connection herewith or therewith. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 2.6(a), there are no continuing orders, injunctions
or   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 10  19  decrees of any Government Authority to which Seller or any of
the Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its properties or assets are
bound.   (b) None of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is in
material violation of any statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, decree or
injunction of any Government Authority or any body having jurisdiction over
them or any of their respective properties which, if enforced, would,
individually or in the aggregate with all other such violations, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.   2.7 Absence of
Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.7 or in any
Seller Report, since June 30, 2000, Seller and each of the Subsidiaries has
conducted its business only in the ordinary course of such business and has
not acquired any real estate or entered into any financing arrangements in
connection therewith, and there has not been (a) any change, circumstance or
event that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or other distribution with respect to the Trust Common Shares, (c) any
commitment, contractual obligation, borrowing, capital expenditure or
transaction (each, a "Commitment") entered into by Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries, other than Commitments which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (d) any change
in Seller\'s accounting principles, practices or methods, (e) any increases
by Seller in any bonuses, salaries or other compensation paid or payable to
any holder of Trust Common Shares, Board Manager, officer or employee, or (f)
any adoption of, or increase in benefits or amounts payable under, any
Plan.   2.8 Tax Matters; REIT and Partnership Status.   (a) Seller and
each of the Subsidiaries has timely filed with the appropriate taxing
authority all tax returns required to be filed by it or has timely requested
extensions and any such request has been granted and has not expired. Each
such tax return is complete and accurate in all material respects. All
information shown on any such tax return is correct in all material respects,
and all material Taxes shown as owed by Seller or by any of the Subsidiaries
on any tax return have been paid or accrued, except for Taxes contested in
good faith and for which adequate reserves have been taken. As used in this
Agreement, "Tax" means any federal, state, local, or foreign income, gross
receipts, license, payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation,
premium, windfall profits, environmental (including taxes under Code (as
defined below) Section 54A), customs duties, capital stock,
profits, withholding, social security (or similar), unemployment, disability,
real property, personal property, sales, use, transfer, registration, value
added, alternative or add-on minimum, estimated, or other tax of any kind
whatsoever, including any interest, penalty or addition thereto, whether
disputed or not. Each of Seller and each of the Subsidiaries has properly
accrued all Taxes for periods subsequent to the periods covered by such tax
returns as required by GAAP. None of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries has
executed or filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other
taxing authority any agreement now in effect extending the period for
assessment or collection of any Tax. None of Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party to any pending action or proceeding by any taxing
authority for assessment or collection of any Tax, and no claim for
assessment or collection of any Tax has been asserted against it. No claim
has been made by any authority in a jurisdiction where Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries does not file tax returns that it is or may be subject
to taxation or reporting in that jurisdiction. There is no dispute or
claim concerning any information, reporting or tax liability of Seller or of
any of the Subsidiaries, (i) claimed or
raised   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 11  20  by any taxing authority in writing or (ii) as to which Seller
or any of the Subsidiaries has knowledge. Seller is a "domestically
controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to Seller\'s knowledge,
there are no nondomestic registered beneficial owners of Trust Common Shares.
To Seller\'s knowledge, no person or entity which would be treated as an
"individual" for purposes of Section 542(a)(2) of the Code (as modified by
Section 856(h) of the Code) owns or would be considered to own (taking into
account the ownership attribution rules under Section 544 of the Code, as
modified by Section 856(h) of the Code) in excess of 9.8% of the value of the
outstanding equity interests in Seller.   (b) Seller (i) made a valid
election in its federal income tax return for the tax year ended December 31,
1993 to be taxed as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code ("REIT") and has complied in all material respects
(and will comply in all material respects) with all applicable provisions of
the Code relating to a REIT, for 1993 through the date hereof, (ii) has
operated, and will to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as
a REIT for 2000 and up to the Effective Time , (iii) has not taken or omitted
to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge to its status as a REIT, and, no such challenge is pending or
threatened, and (iv) to its knowledge, will not be rendered unable to
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Except as described in
Schedule 2.8(c), no amount or other entitlement that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of or in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby by any employee,
officer, or manager of Seller or of any of the Subsidiaries or of any of
their affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; hereinafter, "Affiliates") who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or plan currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b) of the
Code).   (d) Except as described in Schedule 2.8(d), the disallowance of a
deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for employee remuneration will not
apply to any amount paid or payable by Seller or by any of the
Subsidiaries under any contract, stock plan, program, arrangement or
understanding currently in effect.   (e) Each Subsidiary organized as a
partnership or limited liability company (and any other Subsidiary that files
tax returns as a partnership for federal income tax purposes) was and, as of
the date hereof, continues to be, and will continue to be through the Closing
Date, classified as a partnership or as a disregarded entity for federal
income tax purposes. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to (i) Section 1374 of
the Code as the result of Internal Revenue Service Notice 88-19, or (ii)
those contained in proposed regulations issued under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-5, or temporary regulations issued under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-5T, if such regulations were finalized in the form
proposed.   (f) For each taxable year beginning with Seller\'s taxable
year that ended December 31, 1993, the dividends paid by Seller on the Trust
Common Shares have been
and   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 12  21  will continue to be paid pro rata, with no preference to any
Trust Common Share as compared with other shares.   (g) Seller has not
actively conducted a business (i) from which it earns fees for services it
performs and (ii) that would cause (x) Seller\'s REIT status to be lost or
(y) rents from real property to be treated as not rent under the Code.  
(h) As required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.857-8, Seller has maintained
the necessary records regarding the actual ownership of its shares, and has
timely made (i.e., by January 30 of each calendar year) the requisite
information requests of its shareholders regarding share ownership and has
maintained a list of the persons failing or refusing to comply in whole or in
part with Seller\'s demand for statements regarding share ownership.   (i)
Seller has never owned more than 10% of the voting common shares of any
corporation other than a "Qualified REIT Subsidiary," i.e., (i) before 1998,
a corporation, all of whose shares were owned by Seller at all times during
such corporation\'s existence, and (ii) after January 1, 1998, a corporation
(x) all of whose shares are owned by Seller, and (y) all of whose earnings
and profits existing at the time Seller acquired all of its shares
are distributed before the end of the tax year in which all of the shares
are acquired.   2.9 Compliance with Agreements.   (a) Seller is not in
default under or in violation of the Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws and
neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is in default under or in
violation of any material provision of the respective charter, bylaws,
partnership agreement, operating agreement or any similar organizational
document of such Subsidiaries.   (b) Since January 1, 1997, each of Seller
and each of the Subsidiaries has filed all reports, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file with any Government Authority and all
other reports and statements required to be filed by it, including any report
or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations
of the United States, and has paid all fees or assessments due and payable in
connection therewith. There is no unresolved violation asserted by any
regulatory agency of which Seller has received any written notice which, if
resolved in a manner unfavorable to Seller or any Subsidiary, would,
individually or in the aggregate with all other such violations, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Schedule 2.9(c)
sets forth (i) a description of all material indebtedness of Seller and of
each of the Subsidiaries, whether unsecured or secured or collateralized by
mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests in the Property (as
defined in Section 2.11(a)) or any other assets of Seller or of any
Subsidiary, or otherwise and (ii) each Commitment currently in effect entered
into by Seller or by any of the Subsidiaries (including any guarantees of any
third party\'s debt or any obligations in respect of letters of credit issued
for Seller\'s or any Subsidiary\'s account) which may result in total
payments or liability in excess of $100,000, excluding Commitments that are
terminable on thirty (30) days or less notice, and excluding Commitments the
breach of which would not, individually or in the aggregate with all other
such breaches, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 13  22  Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is in default, and, to
Seller\'s knowledge, no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice
or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under any of the
documents described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this
paragraph or in respect of any payment obligations thereunder. All joint
venture and partnership agreements to which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries
is a party as of the date hereof are described in Schedule 2.9(c), all of
which are in full force and effect as against Seller or the applicable
Subsidiary and, to Seller\'s knowledge, as against the other parties thereto,
and none of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is in default, and, to
Seller\'s knowledge, no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice
or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, with respect to any
obligations thereunder, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate
with all other such defaults, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. To Seller\'s knowledge, the other parties to such agreements
are not in breach of any of their respective obligations thereunder, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate with all other such defaults,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To Seller\'s
knowledge, there is no condition with respect to any of the Subsidiaries
(including with respect to the partnership agreements for the Subsidiaries
that are partnerships) that would, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such conditions, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.   (d) Except as disclosed in any other Schedule hereto,
Schedule 2.9(d) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all material
agreements to which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date hereof relating to the development or construction of, additions or
expansions to, or management or leasing services for, light industrial
properties or office buildings or other real properties which are currently
in effect and under which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries currently has, or
expects to incur, any material obligation.   (e) Except for (i) agreements
made in the ordinary course of business with a maturity of less than one (1)
year or that are terminable on thirty (30) days or less notice, and (ii)
agreements the breach or nonfulfillment of which would not, individually or
in the aggregate with all other such breaches or nonfulfillments, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, Schedule 2.9(e) sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all material agreements to which Seller
or any Subsidiary is a party as of the date hereof which are not listed in
any other Schedule hereto and are not exhibits to any filing made by Seller
with the SEC. Each of the Lend Lease Agreement, the Manhattan Towers
Agreement and each agreement listed on Schedule 2.9(e) is in full force and
effect as against Seller and, to Seller\'s knowledge, as against the other
parties thereto, no payments, if any, are delinquent, no notice of default
thereunder has been sent or received by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries,
and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no event has occurred which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default thereunder, except for
any such default that would not, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such defaults, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.   (f) Seller has no written policies regarding transactions
with Affiliates. Schedule 2.9(f) lists all existing agreements with
Affiliates relating to matters other than employment or severance, each of
which employment or severance agreement is listed on Schedule
2.13(a).   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 14  23   2.10 Financial Records; Trust Declaration and Bylaws;
Corporate Records.   (a) The books of account and other financial records
of Seller and of each of the Subsidiaries are in all material respects true
and complete, have been maintained in accordance with good business
practices, and are accurately reflected in all material respects in the
financial statements included in the Seller Reports.   (b) Seller has
delivered or made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the Trust
Declaration and the Bylaws, as amended to date, and the charter, bylaws,
organizational documents, partnership agreements and joint venture agreements
of the Subsidiaries, and all amendments thereto. All such documents are
listed on Schedule 2.10(b).   (c) The minute books and other records of
corporate, trust or partnership proceedings of Seller and of each of the
Subsidiaries contain accurate records of all meetings of the equity holders,
managers and other governing bodies thereof and accurately reflect in all
material respects all other corporate action of the managers, shareholders
and directors and any committees of the Board of Managers and of the
Subsidiaries which are corporations and all actions of the partners of the
Subsidiaries which are partnerships.   2.11 Properties.   (a) Schedule
2.11(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list and the address of all real
property owned or leased by Seller or by any of the Subsidiaries or otherwise
used by Seller or by any of the Subsidiaries in the conduct of their business
or operations. That real property, together with the land at each address
referenced in Schedule 2.11(a) and all buildings, structures and other
improvements and fixtures located on or under such land and all easements,
rights and other appurtenances to such land shall be referred to individually
as a "Property" and collectively as the "Properties." Seller, or, in the case
of properties owned by Subsidiaries, the Subsidiary or trustees holding legal
title solely for the benefit of a Subsidiary indicated in Schedule 2.11(a),
owns good and indefeasible fee simple title (or, if so indicated in Schedule
2.11(a), leasehold title) to each of the Properties, in each case free and
clear of any Liens, title defects, common restrictions or covenants,
laws, ordinances or regulations affecting use or occupancy (including
zoning regulations and building codes) or reservations of interests in
title (collectively, "Property Restrictions"), except for (i) Permitted
Liens, (ii) Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or by any
Government Authority which are customary and typical for similar properties,
and (iii) the obligations relating to the properties identified as Lend Lease
Properties on Schedule 2.11(a) (the "Lend Lease Properties") arising under
the Lend Lease Agreement and the obligations relating to the properties
identified as Manhattan Towers Properties on Schedule 2.11(a) (the "Manhattan
Towers Properties") arising under the Manhattan Towers Agreement. As used in
this Agreement, "Permitted Liens" means (u) Liens (other than Liens imposed
under ERISA or any Environmental Law or in connection with any Environmental
Claim) for taxes or other assessments or charges of Governmental Authorities
that are not yet delinquent or that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings in each case, and with respect to which adequate
reserves or other appropriate provisions are being maintained by Seller or
the Subsidiaries to the extent required by GAAP, (v) statutory Liens of
landlords, carriers, warehousemen, mechanics, materialmen and other Liens
(other than Liens imposed under ERISA or any Environmental Law or in
connection with any Environmental Claim) imposed by law and created in the
ordinary course of business for amounts not

appropriate proceedings, and in each case with respect to which adequate
reserves or other appropriate provisions are being maintained by Seller or
the Subsidiaries to the extent required by GAAP and which do not exceed
$25,000 in the aggregate, (w) the Leases, (x) easements, rights-of-way and
covenant restrictions which are customary and typical for properties similar
to the Properties and which do not (1) interfere materially with the ordinary
conduct of any Property or the business of Seller and the Subsidiaries as a
whole or (2) detract materially from the value or usefulness of the Property
to which they apply, (y) the Liens which were granted by Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries to lenders pursuant to credit agreements in existence on the
date hereof which are described in Schedule 2.9(c), and (z) such
imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, as would not individually or
in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. To Seller\'s knowledge, none of the Permitted Liens interferes with,
impairs, or is violated by the present use, occupancy or operation (or if
applicable, development) of any Property that is not included in the Lend
Lease Properties or in the Manhattan Towers Properties (the Properties not
included in the Lend Lease Properties or the Manhattan Towers Properties, the
"Buyer Properties") and none of the Property Restrictions interferes with,
impairs, or is violated by, the existence of any building or other structure
or improvement which constitutes a part of, or the present use, occupancy or
operation (or, if applicable, development) of, any Buyer Property, except, in
each such case, to the extent that any interference, impairment or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
items, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. American
Land Title Association policies of title insurance (or marked title insurance
commitments having the same force and effect as title insurance policies)
have been issued by national title insurance companies insuring the fee
simple or leasehold, as applicable, title of Seller or a Subsidiary or a
trustee holding legal title solely for the benefit of a Subsidiary, as
applicable, to each of the Buyer Properties in amounts at least equal to the
original cost thereof, subject only to Permitted Liens, and to Seller\'s
knowledge, all such policies are valid and in full force and effect and no
claim has been made under any such policy.   (b) Except as described in
Schedule 2.11(b), Seller has no knowledge (i) that any currently required
certificate, permit or license (including building permits and certificates
of occupancy for tenant spaces) from any Government Authority having
jurisdiction over any Property or any agreement, easement or other right that
is necessary to permit the lawful use, occupancy or operation of the existing
buildings, structures or other improvements that constitute a part of any of
the Properties or which are necessary to permit the lawful use and operation
of any existing driveways, roads or other areas of ingress and egress to and
from any of the Properties has not been obtained or is not in full force and
effect, or of any pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of
same, or (ii) of any violation by any Property of any federal, state or
municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or requirement, including any
applicable zoning law or building code, arising from the use or occupancy of
such Property or otherwise. Except as described in Schedule 2.11(b), Seller
has no knowledge of any current uninsured physical damage to any Buyer
Property in excess of $25,000. To Seller\'s knowledge, except for repairs
identified in the Capital Expenditure Budget and Schedule (as defined below
in Section 2.11(i)), each Buyer Property: (x) is in good operating condition
and repair and is structurally sound and free of defects, with no material
alterations or repairs being required thereto under applicable law
or insurance company requirements, and (y) consists of sufficient land
areas, driveways and other improvements and lawful means of access and
utility service and capacity to permit the use thereof in the manner and for
the purposes to which it is presently devoted (or, in the case of the
Development Properties (as defined below in Section 2.11(j)),
for   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 16  25  the development and operation thereon of the applicable
Project), except, in each such case, to the extent that failure to meet such
standards would not, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c)
Seller has no knowledge (i) except as described in Schedule 2.11(c) that any
condemnation, eminent domain or rezoning proceedings are pending or
threatened with respect to any of the Buyer Properties, (ii) except as
described in Schedule 2.11(c), that any road widening or change of grade of
any road adjacent to any Buyer Property is underway or has been proposed,
(iii) of any proposed change in the assessed valuation of any Buyer Property
other than customarily scheduled revaluations, (iv) of any special assessment
made or threatened against any Property, or (v) that any of the
Buyer Properties is subject to any so-called "impact fee" or to any agreement
with any Government Authority to pay for sewer extension, oversizing
utilities, lighting or like expenses or charges for work or services by such
Government Authority, except, in the case of each of the foregoing, to the
extent that same would not, individually or in the aggregate with all other
such items, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (d)
To Seller\'s knowledge, each of the Buyer Properties is an independent unit
which does not rely on any facilities located on any property not included in
such Property to fulfill any municipal or governmental requirement or for the
furnishing to such Property of any essential building systems or utilities,
other than facilities the benefit of which inures to the Buyer Properties
pursuant to one or more valid easements. Each of the Buyer Properties is
served by public water and sanitary systems and all other utilities, and, to
Seller\'s knowledge, each of the Buyer Properties has lawful access to public
roads, in all cases sufficient for the current use and occupancy of that
Property (or, in the case of the Development Properties, for the development
and operation thereon of the applicable Project (as defined herein)). To
Seller\'s knowledge, all parcels of land included in each Buyer Property that
purport to be contiguous are contiguous and are not separated by strips or
gores. To Seller\'s knowledge, no portion of any Buyer Property lies in any
flood plain area (as defined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
or otherwise) or includes any wetlands or vegetation or species protected by
any applicable laws. To Seller\'s knowledge, no improvements constituting a
part of any Buyer Property encroach on real property not constituting a part
of such Property.   (e) Except for matters addressed in the Capital
Expenditure Budget and Schedule, no Property fails to comply with the
requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act (the "ADA") except for
such noncompliance as Seller reasonably believes will not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   (f) Seller has provided to
Parent and Buyer an accurate rent roll for each Buyer Property as of
September 30, 2000 (the "Rent Roll"), which identifies and accurately
describes each lease of space in each Buyer Property (collectively, the
"Leases"). Seller has delivered to Parent and Buyer an abstract of each Lease
(the "Abstracts") which accurately describes the material terms thereof. With
respect to each Lease for premises larger than 20,000 square feet of rentable
space (each a "Material Lease" and collectively, the "Material Leases"),
except as described in Schedule 2.11(f) and except for matters that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have a material
effect on any Buyer Property, (i) each of the Material Leases is valid and
subsisting and in full force and effect as against each party thereto,
and has not been amended, modified or supplemented, other than by any
amendment, modification or supplement that has been provided to Parent and
Buyer, (ii) the tenant
under   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 17  26  each of the Material Leases is in actual possession of the
premises leased thereunder, (iii) no tenant under any Material Lease is more
than thirty (30) days in arrears in the payment of rent, (iv) none of Seller
or any of the Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any tenant
under any Material Lease of its intention to vacate, (v) none of Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries has collected payment of rent under any Material
Lease (other than security deposits) for a period which is more than one (1)
month in advance, (vi) no notice of default has been sent or received by the
landlord under any Material Lease with respect to any defect that remains
uncured as of the date hereof, no default has occurred under any Material
Lease and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no event has occurred and is continuing
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under
any Material Lease, (vii) no tenant under any of the Material Leases has any
purchase option or kick-out right or is entitled to any concession,
allowance, abatement, set-off, rebate or refund, (viii) none of the Material
Leases and none of the rents or other amounts payable thereunder has been
assigned, pledged or encumbered except in connection with financing secured
by the applicable Buyer Property, which is described in Schedule 2.9(c), (ix)
no brokerage or leasing commission or other compensation is due or payable to
any Person with respect to or on account of any of the Material Leases or any
extensions or renewals thereof, (x) except as set forth in the Abstracts, no
space of a material size in any Buyer Property is occupied by a tenant rent-
free, (xi) no tenant under any of the Material Leases has asserted any claim
which is likely to affect the collection of rent from such tenant, and (xii)
the landlord under each Material Lease has fulfilled all of its obligations
thereunder in respect of tenant improvements and capital expenditures. Other
than the tenants identified in the Rent Roll and Abstracts and parties to
easement agreements which constitute Permitted Liens, no third party has any
right to occupy or use any portion of any Buyer Property. The Rent Roll or
Abstracts include a budget for all material tenant improvements and similar
material work required to be performed by the lessor under each of
the Material Leases.   (g) Schedule 2.11(g) sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all material commitments, letters of intent or written
understandings made or entered into by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof (i) to lease any space larger than 20,000 rentable square
feet at any of the Buyer Properties, (ii) to sell, mortgage, or pledge any
Buyer Property or to otherwise enter into a material transaction or
arrangement in respect of the ownership or financing of any Buyer Property,
or (iii) to purchase or acquire an option, right of first refusal or similar
right in respect of any real property, which, in any such case has not yet
been reduced to a written lease or contract, and sets forth with respect to
each such commitment, letter of intent or other understanding the principal
terms thereof.   (h) Except as set forth in the Rent Roll or Abstracts,
and except for certain rights of first refusal which are set forth in the
sections of the partnership agreements referenced in Schedule 2.1(d) and
which relate to partnerships in which Seller, directly or indirectly, owns
less than a 100% interest, none of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries has
granted any outstanding options or has entered into any outstanding contracts
with others for the sale, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment,
sublease, lease or other transfer of all or any part of any Buyer Property,
and no person has any right or option to acquire, or right of refusal with
respect to, Seller\'s or any Subsidiary\'s interest in any Buyer Property or
any part thereof. Except as described in Schedule 2.11(h), none of Seller or
any Subsidiary has any outstanding options or rights of first refusal or has
entered into any outstanding contracts with others for the purchase of any
real
property.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 18  27   (i) Schedule 2.11(i) contains a complete and
accurate description of any material noncompliance by any Property, to
Seller\'s knowledge, with any law, ordinance, code, health and safety
regulation or insurance requirement (except for the ADA, which is addressed
in this respect in Section 2.11(e) above) other than such noncompliance as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 2.11(i) also sets forth Seller\'s and each
Subsidiary\'s capital expenditure budget and schedule for each Buyer Property
(the "Capital Expenditure Budget and Schedule"), which describes the capital
expenditures which Seller or any Subsidiary has budgeted for such Property
that was acquired prior to January 1, 2000 for the period from January 1,
2000 through December 31, 2000 and the expected capital expenditures from
February 1, 2001 through May 31, 2001. To Seller\'s knowledge, the costs and
time schedules for 2000 and 2001 (February through May 2001) set forth in the
Capital Expenditure Budget and Schedule are reasonable estimates and
projections. Except as described in Schedule 2.11(i), there are no
outstanding, or to Seller\'s knowledge, threatened requirements of any
insurance company which has issued an insurance policy covering any Buyer
Property, or of any board of fire underwriters or other body exercising
similar functions, requiring any repairs or alterations to be made to any
Buyer Property.   (j) Schedule 2.11(j) contains a list of each Buyer
Property which consists of or includes undeveloped land or which is in the
process of being developed or rehabilitated (each, a "Development Property,"
and collectively, the "Development Properties") and a brief description of
the development or rehabilitation intended by Seller or any Subsidiary to be
carried out or completed thereon (collectively, the "Projects"), including
any budget and development or rehabilitation schedule therefor prepared by or
for Seller or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Development Budget and
Schedule"). Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.11(j), each Development
Property is zoned for the lawful development thereon of the applicable
Project, and the Trust or a Subsidiary has obtained all permits, licenses,
consents and authorizations required for the lawful development or
rehabilitation thereon of such Project, except only for such failure to meet
the foregoing standards as would not, individually or in the aggregate with
all other such failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as described in Schedule 2.11(j), to Seller\'s knowledge,
there are no material impediments to or constraints on the development or
rehabilitation of any Project in all material respects within the time frame
and for the cost set forth in the Development Budget and Schedule applicable
thereto. In the case of each Project, the development of which has commenced,
to Seller\'s knowledge, the costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such Project and the progress thereof are, except as described in
Schedule 2.11(j), consistent and in compliance in all material respects with
all aspects of the Development Budget and Schedule applicable thereto. All
development and rehabilitation efforts with respect to the Development
Properties and the Project have ceased.   (k) Seller has disclosed to Buyer
all adverse matters known to Seller with respect to or in connection with the
Buyer Properties (including the Leases and the Tenancy Leases), which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (l) The ground leases underlying the leased Buyer
Properties referenced in Schedule 2.11(a) (collectively, the "Tenancy
Leases") are listed in Schedule 2.11(l). Each of the Tenancy Leases is valid,
binding and in full force and effect against the applicable Subsidiary and,
to Seller\'s knowledge, against the other party thereto. Except as indicated
in Schedule
2.11(l),   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 19   28 none of the Tenancy Leases is subject to any pledge, lien,
sublease, assignment, license or other agreement granting to any third party
any interest in or any right to the use or occupancy of any premises leased
thereunder. To Seller\'s knowledge, except as described in Schedule 2.11(l),
there is no pending or threatened proceeding which is reasonably likely to
interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the tenant under any of the Tenancy
Leases. Except as described in Schedule 2.11(l), no payments under any
Tenancy Lease are delinquent and no notice of default thereunder has been
sent or received by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries. There does not exist
under any of the Tenancy Leases any default, and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no
event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such defaults, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (m) Each of Seller and each of the Subsidiaries
has good and sufficient title to all the personal and other property and
assets reflected in their books and records as being owned by them (including
those reflected in the balance sheets of Seller and the Subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2000, except as since sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens
which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have
a material adverse effect on any Property.   2.12 Environmental
Matters.   (a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.12(a), to
Seller\'s knowledge, each of Seller and the Subsidiaries has obtained and now
maintains as currently valid and effective all permits required to be
possessed by Seller or its Subsidiaries under Environmental Laws (the
"Environmental Permits") in connection with the operation of its businesses
and properties, all of which are listed in Schedule 2.12(a), except where the
failure to have such Environmental Permit would not individually or in the
aggregate with all other failures to have a required Environmental Permit,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To Seller\'s
knowledge, except as disclosed in the Environmental Reports (as defined
below), each of Seller and the Subsidiaries, and each Property, is in
compliance with all terms and conditions of the Environmental Permits and all
Environmental Laws, except for any noncompliance that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Seller or a Subsidiary. Seller has no knowledge of any actually and
currently existing circumstances that may prevent or interfere with such
compliance in the future.   (b) Each of Seller and the Subsidiaries has made
available to Parent and Buyer all material written information and written
communications (whether from a Government Authority, citizens\' group,
employee or other person) in its possession or control regarding (i) alleged
or suspected noncompliance of any of the Properties with any Environmental
Laws or Environmental Permits or (ii) alleged or suspected liability of
Seller or any Subsidiary under any Environmental Law.   (c) There are no
environmental liens or encumbrances on any of the Properties and, to
Seller\'s knowledge, no government actions have been taken or are in process
which are reasonably likely to subject any Property to such liens or other
encumbrances that would prevent the use of such Property as currently
conducted.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 20  29   (d) No Environmental Claim (as defined below) with respect
to the operations or the businesses of Seller or of any Subsidiary, or with
respect to the Properties, has been asserted or, to Seller\'s knowledge,
threatened, and, to Seller\'s knowledge, no circumstances exist with respect
to Seller or any of the Subsidiaries or the Properties that would reasonably
be expected to result in any Environmental Claim being asserted, in any such
case, (i) against (x) Seller or any of the Subsidiaries, or (y) any person
whose liability for any Environmental Claims Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by
operation of law, and (ii) which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (e) Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12(e) or
set forth in the Environmental Reports: (i) none of Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries has been notified or has reason to believe that it will be
notified of potential responsibility in connection with any site that has
been placed on, or proposed to be placed on, the National Priorities List or
its state or foreign equivalent pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. Section 9601,
et seq., or analogous state or foreign laws, (ii) to Seller\'s knowledge, no
Materials of Environmental Concern are present on, in or under any Property
in a manner or condition that is reasonably likely to give rise to an
Environmental Claim which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) and to Seller\'s knowledge, none of Seller,
any Subsidiary or any tenant of any Property has Released or arranged for the
Release of any Materials of Environmental Concern at any location to
an extent or in a manner which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Property, (iv) to Seller\'s knowledge, no
underground storage tanks, surface disposal areas, pits, ponds, lagoons, open
trenches or equipment is present at any Property, (iv) to Seller\'s
knowledge, no transformers, capacitors or other equipment containing fluid

any Property, except for any such transformers, capacitation or other
equipment owned by any utility company, and (vi) to Seller\'s knowledge, no
employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor or tenant of Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries is now or has in the past been exposed to friable asbestos or
asbestos-containing material at any Property.   (f) Seller has made
available to Buyer the most recent Phase I environmental reports prepared for
Seller or the Subsidiaries or otherwise in the possession of any of them with
respect to the environmental condition of any Property (collectively, the
"Environmental Reports").   (g) For purposes of this Section 2.12, the terms

(a) Schedule 2.13(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
employment agreements with employees of Seller or of any of the Subsidiaries.
Except for the employees who are parties to such employment agreements, all

organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a collective
bargaining unit presently being made or threatened involving employees of
Seller or of any of the Subsidiaries.   2.15 No Payments to Employees,
Officers or Directors. Schedule 2.15 contains a true and complete list of all
cash and noncash payments which will become payable to each employee, officer
or director of Seller or any Subsidiary as a result of or in connection with
the Merger, the Lend Lease Transaction or the Manhattan Towers Transaction or
those transactions taken as a whole. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.15,
there is no employment or severance contract or other agreement requiring
payments, cancellation of indebtedness or other obligations to be made or
satisfied on a change of control or otherwise as a result of or in connection
with the Merger, the Lend Lease Transaction or the Manhattan Towers
Transaction or those transactions taken as a whole, with respect to any
employee, officer or director of Seller or any Subsidiary.   2.16 Insurance.
Seller maintains insurance policies covering the assets, business, equipment,
properties, operations, employees, officers, managers, and directors of
Seller and of each of the Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Insurance
Policies") which are of a type and in amounts customarily carried by persons
similar in size to Seller conducting businesses similar to those of Seller.
There is no material claim by Seller or by any of the Subsidiaries pending
under any of the Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed by any underwriter of such policy.   2.17 Proxy
Statement; Additional Filings. The Proxy Statement and the Additional Filings
(both as defined in Section 5.1(a)) and all of the information included or
incorporated by reference therein (other than any information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Buyer for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein) will not, as of the date such Proxy Statement is first made
available to the shareholders of Seller or as of the date the Additional
Filings are filed, and as of the time of the meeting of the shareholders of
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement and the Additional Filings will comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder, except that
no representation is made by Seller with respect to the information supplied
by Parent or Buyer for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

contemplated by this Agreement.   2.19 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Seller
has received the opinion of Chase Securities Inc. dated the date of this
Agreement, a signed copy of which will be provided to Parent and Buyer, to
the effect that, on the date hereof, the Common Consideration to be received
by the holders of Trust Common Shares pursuant to the Merger is fair to such
holders from a financial point of
view.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the laws of the State of Ohio. Buyer is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas.

performance of this Agreement and of all of the documents and instruments
delivered in connection herewith by each of Parent and Buyer has been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and Buyer. Assuming this Agreement and such other documents and
instruments constitute binding obligations of Seller, this Agreement is, and
the other documents and instruments required hereby will be, when executed
and delivered by Parent and Buyer, the valid and binding obligations of each
of Parent and Buyer, enforceable against Parent and Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms subject only to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws at the time in effect affecting
the enforceability or right of creditors generally and to general equitable
principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The Board of Directors of Buyer has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
Texas law. The Board of Directors of Parent has authorized and approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with Ohio law.   3.3 No Conflicts: No Defaults, Required Filings
and Consents. Neither the execution and delivery by Parent or Buyer of this
Agreement, nor the consummation by Parent or Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and

termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate
the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties of Parent or Buyer or of any of their subsidiaries under,
or result in being declared void, voidable or without further binding effect,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust or any franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement
or other instrument, commitment or obligation to which Parent or Buyer or any
of their subsidiaries is a party, or by which Parent or Buyer or any of their
subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or   (d)
require any consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing or
registration with, any Government Authority, other than the Articles of
Merger pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof and the Filings, and any filings
required to be made with the Texas State Department of Assessments
and Taxation, if any, or any national securities exchange on which the
Parent\'s common shares are listed.   3.4 Proxy Statement; Additional
Filings. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or

and as of the time of the meeting of the shareholders of Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   3.5 Investment

consummation of Merger neither Parent nor Buyer will be, an "investment
company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms
are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   3.6 Capital
Structure. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will be the sole
shareholder of Buyer and own 10,000 shares of Buyer\'s common stock. Other
than as described in the immediately preceding sentence and except for
Parent\'s understandings with approximately 100 employees of Parent
with regard to the issuance to those employees of Surviving Company preferred
stock immediately following the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, there
will be no outstanding equity securities or other equity interests, debt
securities or derivative securities of Buyer or any oral or written
agreements regarding the issuance of same. There are no outstanding
securities or assets convertible into, exercisable for or exchangeable for
any debt, equity or derivative securities of Buyer or any oral or written
agreements regarding the issuance of same.   3.7 Litigation; Compliance

or any of their subsidiaries that would question the validity of this
Agreement or
any  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 27  36  action taken or to be taken in connection herewith, or that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Buyer or Parent Material Adverse Effect that would affect their ability to
perform their obligations under this Agreement.   3.8 Funding. Parent and
Buyer have cash or financing commitments (as described in Schedule 3.8)
sufficient to enable them to perform their obligations hereunder.   
ARTICLE 4   COVENANTS   4.1 Acquisition Proposals. Prior to the Effective
Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Seller agrees that:   (a) neither it nor any of the Subsidiaries
shall initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer
(including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its shareholders)
with respect to a merger, acquisition, tender offer, exchange offer,
consolidation, sale of assets or similar transaction involving all or any
significant portion of the assets or any equity securities of Seller or any
of the Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Lend Lease Agreement and the Manhattan Towers Agreement (any
such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition
Proposal") or engage in any negotiations concerning or provide any
confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal;   (b) it shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, Board Managers,
employees, agents and financial advisors not to engage in any of the
activities described in Section 4.1(a) except to the extent expressly
permitted by the proviso below;   (c) it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; and  
(d) it will notify Buyer promptly if Seller receives any such inquiries or
proposals, or any requests for such information, or if any such negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with it;  provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of
Managers (or the officers, Board Managers, employees, agents or financial
advisors of Seller acting at the direction of the Board of Managers) from (i)
furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and
only to the extent that (x) the Board of Managers (excluding
Parent\'s designees) determines in good faith following consultation with
counsel and with Seller\'s financial advisors that such action is required
for the Board of Managers to comply with its duties to shareholders imposed
by law or such proposal is or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (y) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such person or entity, Seller provides
written  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 28  37   notice to Parent and Buyer to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions with, such person or
entity, and (z) subject to any confidentiality agreement with such person or
entity, Seller keeps Parent and Buyer informed of the status (not the terms)
of any such discussions or negotiations; or (ii) to the extent applicable,
taking and disclosing to Seller\'s shareholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal. Nothing in this Section 4.1 shall (1) permit Seller to
terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article 7
hereof), (2) permit Seller to enter into an agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement in customary form executed as provided above) or
(3) affect any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Board of Managers may approve and recommend a Superior
Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger. Any disclosure
that the Board of Managers may be compelled to make with respect to the
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal in order to comply with its duties
to shareholders of Seller or comply with applicable law will not constitute
a violation of this Section 4.1. As used herein, "Superior Acquisition
Proposal" means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third party which
the Board of Managers (excluding Parent\'s designees) (or a duly constituted
committee thereof charged with considering Acquisition Proposals) determines
in good faith following consultation with counsel and with Seller\'s
financial advisors to be more favorable to Seller\'s shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and which the Board of Managers
(excluding Parent\'s designees) (or any such committee) determines is
reasonably capable of being financed and consummated.   4.2 Conduct of
Seller\'s Business Pending Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, except as
consented to in writing by Parent and Buyer (which consent or withholding of
consent shall be communicated by Parent and Buyer to Seller within seven (7)
business days of the date of the request for such consent; provided, however,
if Parent and Buyer do not respond to the request for consent within such
seven (7) day period, they shall be deemed to have consented to
such request), as expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Lend Lease
Agreement or the Manhattan Towers Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause
each of the Subsidiaries to:   (a) conduct its business only in the usual,
regular and ordinary course and in substantially the same manner as
heretofore and take all action necessary to continue to qualify as a
REIT;   (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its
business organization and goodwill and keep available the services of
its officers and key employees;   (c) confer on a regular basis with one or
more representatives of Parent and Buyer to report operational matters of
materiality and, subject to Section 4.1, any proposal to engage in material
transactions;   (d) promptly notify Parent and Buyer of any material
emergency or other material change in the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, properties, assets, liabilities or the normal course of its
businesses or in the operation of its properties, or of any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may
be contemplated);  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

material reports, tax returns and other documents required to be filed with

affect Seller\'s status as a qualified REIT under the Code;   (h) not make
or rescind any material express or deemed election relative to Taxes that
would adversely affect Seller\'s status as a REIT or the status of any
Subsidiary as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or as a qualified
REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, as the case may be;   (i)
make reasonably budgeted capital expenditures in the ordinary course of

commitment to develop or construct, other real estate projects, except

with the agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement and previously
furnished to Parent and Buyer (the "Development Agreements");   (j) not
amend its Trust Declaration or Bylaws, or the articles or certificate of

limited partnership interest, or any security the value of which is measured
by its or any Subsidiary\'s shares of beneficial interest, or any security

COVENANTS   5.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Seller Shareholders
Meeting.   (a) The parties shall cooperate and promptly prepare, and Seller
shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable a proxy statement with respect
to the meeting of the shareholders of Seller in connection with the Merger
and the Lend Lease Transaction (the "Proxy Statement"). The parties
shall cooperate and promptly prepare and the appropriate party shall file
with the SEC as soon as practicable any other filings required under the
Exchange Act ("Additional Filings"), including without limitation, a Rule
13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 with respect to the Merger to
be filed jointly by Seller, Parent and Buyer, together with any required
amendments thereto. Each of Seller, Parent and Buyer agrees that the
information provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, the
Additional Filings, and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of
mailing or filing thereof and at the time of the meeting of shareholders of
Seller, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts, and Parent and
Buyer will cooperate with Seller, to (i) file a preliminary Proxy Statement
with the SEC and (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Seller\'s
shareholders, in each case, as promptly as practicable (including clearing
the Proxy Statement with the SEC). The parties will notify one another
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
the Additional Filings or for additional information and will supply one
another with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of
its representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the Additional Filings. The parties shall cooperate to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Additional Filings to comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law. Whenever any event occurs which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or the Additional Filings, Seller on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer on
the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC and mailing to the shareholders of Seller,
as applicable, such amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
Additional Filing. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
other parties to the Lend Lease Agreement and the Manhattan Towers Agreement
to take such actions and provide such cooperation as may be necessary to
ensure that the Proxy Statement, the Additional Filings, and each amendment
or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing or filing thereof and at the
time of the meeting of shareholders of Seller, will not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and to facilitate
Seller\'s compliance with its obligations under this Section 5.1.   (b) To
the extent the Proxy Statement contains financial statements of Seller, it is
a condition to the mailing of the Proxy Statement and the making of the
Additional
Filings  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 33  42  that if they so request, Parent and Buyer shall have received
a "comfort" letter or an "agreed upon procedures" letter from Ernst and Young
LLP, independent public accountants for Seller, of the kind contemplated by
the Statement of Auditing Standards with respect to Letters to Underwriters
promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the
"AICPA Statement"), dated as of the date on which the Proxy Statement is to
be mailed to the shareholders of Seller, addressed to Parent and Buyer, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Buyer, concerning
the procedures undertaken by Ernst and Young LLP with respect to the financial
statements and information of Seller and the Subsidiaries contained in the
Proxy Statement and the Additional Filings and the other matters contemplated
by the AICPA Statement and otherwise customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
transactions such as those contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Seller
will, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, such meeting
to be held no sooner than twenty (20) business days nor later than forty-five
(45) days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
shareholders of Seller (the "Seller Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining Seller\'s shareholders\' approval of the Merger and the Lend Lease
Transaction. Seller shall be required to hold the Seller
Shareholders Meeting, regardless of whether the Board of Managers has
withdrawn, amended or modified its recommendation that its shareholders adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger and the Lend Lease Transaction, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1. Seller will,
through the Board of Managers, recommend that its shareholders adopt this
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, and approve the Lend Lease Transaction and the Manhattan Towers
Transaction; however, prior to the Seller Shareholders Meeting, such
recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended if Seller shall have
received a Superior Acquisition Proposal, but only to the extent expressly
permitted under Section 4.1.   (d) If, on the date for the Seller
Shareholders Meeting established pursuant to Section 5.1(c) of this
Agreement, Seller has not received duly executed proxies which, when added to
the number of votes represented in person at the meeting by persons who
intend to vote to adopt this Agreement and approve the Lend Lease
Transaction, will constitute a sufficient number of votes to adopt this
Agreement and approve those transactions (but less than a majority of the
outstanding Trust Common Shares have indicated their intention to vote
against, or have submitted duly executed proxies voting against, the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of those transactions), then Seller shall
recommend the adjournment of its shareholders meeting until the date ten (10)
days after the originally scheduled date of the shareholders meeting.   5.2
Access to Information: Confidentiality. Prior to the Effective Time, subject
to the requirements of confidentiality agreements with third parties, Seller
shall, and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
Buyer and to their officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives, upon reasonable advance
notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to all of Seller\'s
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, Seller shall, and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent and Buyer all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent and Buyer may reasonably
request. Parent

qualified as to materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becomes untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) of the failure by it to comply

maintained for employees of the Surviving Company or the Parent, as
applicable, but only to the extent required by Section 601 et seq., of ERISA,

now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer, employee, Board Manager or director of Seller
or any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") which is the same as the
exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by Seller
and the Subsidiaries (including advancement of expenses) immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the Trust Declaration and Bylaws, in any
separate indemnification agreements (each as listed on Schedule 5.7(a)
hereto) between Seller and its officers and Board Managers, or in any
Employee Benefit Plan or Pension Plan, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof or pursuant to the REIT Act; provided, that such exculpation and
indemnification covers only actions or omissions on or prior to the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) In addition to the rights provided in Section

security holders of Seller, Surviving Company, Parent or Buyer, or any
Subsidiary or Buyer Subsidiary, or by or in the right of Seller, Surviving
Company, Parent or Buyer, or any Subsidiary or Buyer Subsidiary, or any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is
now, or has been, at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer, Board Manager, employee or director of
Seller or any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to
be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer, employee,
Board Manager or director of Seller, Surviving Company, or any of
the Subsidiaries or any action or omission or alleged action or omission by
such person in his capacity as an officer, employee, Board Manager or
director of Seller, Surviving Company, or of any of the Subsidiaries, or (ii)
this Agreement, the Lend Lease Agreement and the Manhattan Towers Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether in any case
asserted
or  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 36  45   arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent, Buyer,
Seller, Surviving Company and the Indemnified Parties hereby agree to
cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. It is understood and agreed that, from and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, each
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, liabilities, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in accordance herewith in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. In
addition, after the Effective Time, in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Surviving
Company shall promptly pay in advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred
by each Indemnified Person as they become due and payable in advance of the
final disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to
the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law. No Indemnified Party
will be required to consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, such undertaking to be accepted without regard to
the creditworthiness of the Indemnified Party, to repay any expenses advanced
if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Surviving Company (x) shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, and
(y) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and
nonappealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable
law. In the event of a final and nonappealable determination by a court that
any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly refund to the Surviving Company the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.   (c) Any Indemnified Party
hereunder will (i) give prompt notice to the Surviving Company of any claim
which arises from or after the Effective Time with respect to which it seeks
indemnification and (ii) permit the Surviving Company to assume the defense
of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to a majority of the
Indemnified Parties; provided, however, if the Indemnified Parties include
the Parent\'s designees who serve or served as Board Managers, such Parent
designees shall have no vote in the selection of or approval of counsel for
all of the Indemnified Parties. In connection with the selection of counsel
to represent the Indemnified Parties in connection with clause (ii) above,
the Surviving Corporation shall propose counsel to represent the Indemnified
Parties. The applicable Indemnified Parties shall have the right to approve
such counsel, but such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the
proposed counsel is not approved, the Surviving Company shall continue to
propose counsel until counsel for the Surviving Company is approved by the
applicable Indemnified Parties. Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person
unless: (x) the Surviving Company has agreed, in writing, to pay such fees or
expenses; (y) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense
of such claim after the receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party as
required above and failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to a
majority of the Indemnified Parties (other than the DDR designees that are or
were Board Managers) or (z) based upon advice of counsel to
such  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 37  46   Indemnified Party and concurrence therewith by counsel for
the group of Indemnified Parties in such matter, there shall be one or more
defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are not available to the
Surviving Company or there shall exist conflicts of interest between such
Indemnified Party and the Surviving Company and/or the other Indemnified
Parties (in which case, if the Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving
Company in writing that such Indemnified Party elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the Surviving Company, the Surviving Company shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such
Indemnified Party), in each of which events the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Company) shall be at the expense of the Surviving Company.   (d)
At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall purchase on or before the
Effective Time and thereafter the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect
until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, "run-off" directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy coverage for Seller\'s Board Managers
and officers which will provide the Board Managers and officers with coverage
on substantially similar terms as currently provided by Seller to such Board
Managers and officers. Seller and Buyer shall have the right to review
and approve any such policy, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (e) This Section 5.7 is intended for the irrevocable
benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and
their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on the Indemnified
Parties, Buyer, Seller and all successors and assigns of Buyer and Seller.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 5.7 and Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that
each Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate
remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in the
event of any breach of any provision in this Section 5.7.   (f) In the
event that the Surviving Company or any of its respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, then, and in each such case, the successors and assigns of such
entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7, which
obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Board Manager, director and officer and their
respective successors, assigns and heirs covered hereby.   (g) Seller
represents and warrants that it has not created an indemnification trust of
the kind referred to in the indemnification agreements listed on Schedule
5.7(a) and agrees that it will not create such a trust at or prior to the
Effective Time.   (h) The rights granted to the Indemnified Parties in
this Section 5.7 are in addition to any other rights to which the Indemnified
Parties may be entitled.   5.8 Declaration of Dividends and Distributions.
From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall not pay any dividend
or make any distribution to its shareholders without the prior written
consent of Parent and Buyer, but the written consent of Parent and Buyer
shall not be required for the authorization and payment of the Final Dividend
(if any). The foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, to the extent
a distribution by Seller is necessary for
Seller   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 38  47   to maintain REIT status or to prevent Seller from having to
pay federal income tax; but, except with respect to the Final Dividend, in
the event of such a distribution, the aggregate cash consideration payable to
holders of Trust Common Shares in the Merger shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of such distribution, and the Common Consideration per share
shall be reduced accordingly.   5.9 Outside Property Management Agreements.
Seller will not, and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, amend any
property management agreement with any party that is not an Affiliate of the
Seller or the Subsidiaries (each, an "Outside Property Management
Agreement"). Seller will not, and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to,
renew any Outside Property Management Agreement except on terms which are the
same as the existing Outside Property Management Agreement or more favorable
to Seller or the applicable Subsidiary than the existing Outside Property
Management Agreement.   5.10 Lend Lease and Manhattan Towers Transactions.
Seller shall comply with all of its obligations under the Lend Lease
Agreement and under the Manhattan Towers Agreement and shall use all
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or appropriate to
consummate and make effective the Lend Lease Transaction and the Manhattan
Towers Transaction.   5.11 Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby guarantees the
performance of Buyer\'s and the Surviving Company\'s obligations under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any such obligation arising under
Section 5.7 of this Agreement.   5.12 Share Purchase Agreement. If the
Merger is not consummated by May 31, 2001 as a result of a breach by Parent
or Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder, Parent\'s and Seller\'s rights
and obligations under Section 6.6 of the Share Purchase Agreement dated July
30, 1998 between Parent and Seller, as amended by Amendment No. One to Share
Purchase Agreement dated as of September 14, 1998 between Parent and Seller,
will be extended from November 20, 2000 by the number of days between June
19, 2000 and the later of (i) the date on which that breach occurs or (ii)
the first date on which any Board Manager that is not a designee of Parent
becomes aware of the breach.   5.13 Lend Lease and Manhattan Towers
Agreements. Seller shall not amend the Lend Lease Agreement or the Manhattan
Towers Agreement in any manner whatsoever that affects the economic
consequences or imposes any additional obligations on AIP or any AIP
Affiliates thereunder without Parent\'s prior written consent. Seller shall
provide Parent with immediate written notice of any modification or
amendment, including a copy thereof, to the Lend Lease Agreement or the
Manhattan Towers Agreement.   5.14 Voting Agreement by Parent. Parent hereby
agrees that it shall vote all Trust Common Shares owned, directly or
indirectly, of record or beneficially, by it and shall cause each of its
Affiliates (excluding individuals, but including, but not limited, to Buyer
to vote all Trust Common Shares owned, directly or indirectly, of record or
beneficially, by them in favor of the Merger and in favor of the transactions
contemplated by the Lend Lease Agreement. The parties agree that any breach
of this Section 5.14 by Parent would result in irreparable damage to Seller
inadequately compensable in damages; therefore, this Section 5.14 shall be
specifically enforceable, and any breach or threatened breach of this Section
5.14 will be the proper
subject  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 39  48  of a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining order.
Further, each party hereto and its successors, heirs, representatives and
assigns waive any claim or defense that there is an adequate remedy at law
for breach or threatened breach.   5.15 Settlement of Litigation. On or
prior to the Effective Date, (i) if a party seeks indemnity from Seller,

settle any litigation relating to the Merger, the Lend Lease Transaction or

days before the scheduled Proxy Statement mailing, with respect to a date two
(2) business days after the scheduled date set forth in the Proxy Statement
for the Seller Shareholders Meeting (the "Anticipated Closing Date"), the
difference between (A) the sum of the actual amounts of the items described

decision of Deloitte and Touche LLP shall be final and binding on the parties.

Deloitte and Touche LLP, including expenses and fees for services rendered,
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If the Base Amount is more than
$1,000,000 above $173,564,000, the Common Consideration shall be increased in
an amount equal to the amount by which the Base Amount calculated in this
Section 6.2(m) exceeds $173,564,000, divided by the number of Trust Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the Trust Common Shares held, directly or indirectly, by
Parent).   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agreement.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement because of the commencement
after the date hereof of litigation that challenges the validity of this
Agreement, the Lend Lease Agreement or the Manhattan Towers Agreement or of

Manhattan Towers Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and such injunctive relief has not been dissolved or
vacated.   6.3 Conditions to Obligations of Seller. The obligation of Seller

any  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 45  54   manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
occurrence of the failure referred to in this clause;   (f) by either

Parent or Buyer if, upon a vote at the Seller Shareholders Meeting or any
adjournment thereof, the approval of the Merger by Seller\'s shareholders
shall not have been obtained as contemplated by Section 5.1;   (g) by
Seller, if prior to the Seller Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Managers
shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of the Merger
or this Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, a Superior

definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.   7.2
Certain Fees and Expenses. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(b), 7.1(g) or 7.1(h), then Seller will pay Buyer (if Seller was
not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at the
time of such termination) a fee equal to the Seller Break-Up Fee (as defined
below). If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c),
then Buyer will pay Seller (provided Parent and Buyer were not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of
such termination) a fee equal to the Buyer Break-Up Fee (as defined below).
Any payment of the Seller Break-Up Fee or the Buyer Break-Up Fee in
accordance with this Section 7.2 shall be compensation for the loss suffered
by the recipient as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances,
and neither party shall have any other liability to the other after the
payment of the Seller Break-Up Fee or the Buyer Break-Up Fee, as applicable.
The Seller Break-Up Fee or the Buyer Break-Up Fee, as applicable, shall be
paid in immediately available funds within fifteen (15) days after the date
the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment occurred.   As
used in this Agreement, "Seller Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $4,500,000 (the "Seller Base Amount") and (ii) the sum of (A)
the maximum amount that can be paid to the recipient without causing Parent
or Buyer to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I)
of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent accountants
to Parent, and (B) if Parent receives an opinion from outside counsel (the
"Seller Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion") indicating that Parent\'s or Buyer\'s
receipt of the Seller Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT Requirements") or that the receipt
by Parent or Buyer of the remaining balance of the Seller Base Amount
following the receipt of and in accordance with such opinion would not be
deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Seller Base Amount less the
amount payable under clause (A)
above.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Page 46  55    As used in this Agreement, "Buyer Break-Up Fee" shall be an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of (x) $4,500,000 plus (y) if the
Lend Lease Agreement is terminated because of a breach by Parent or Buyer
hereunder and, as a result thereof, Seller is obligated to pay Lend Lease
Real Estate Investors, Inc. the fee under Section 7.5 of the Lend Lease
Agreement an amount equal to that fee (the "Buyer Base Amount") and (ii) the
sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Seller without causing
Seller to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to Seller, and
(B) if Seller receives an opinion from outside counsel (the "Buyer Break-Up
Fee Tax Opinion") indicating that Seller\'s receipt of the Buyer Base Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that the receipt by
Seller of the remaining balance of the Buyer Base Amount following the
receipt of and pursuant to such opinion would not be deemed constructively
received prior thereto, the Buyer Base Amount less the amount payable under
clause (A) above.   If the recipient is not able to receive the full Seller
Base Amount or the Buyer Base Amount, as applicable, the payor shall place
the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the
recipient unless and until the payor receives either one of the following:
(i) a letter from the recipient\'s independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the recipient without causing
the recipient (or Parent, as applicable) to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii) a Seller Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Buyer Break-Up Fee
Tax Opinion, as applicable, in either of which events the payor shall pay to
the recipient the lesser of the unpaid Seller Base Amount or the Buyer Base
Amount, as applicable, or the maximum amount stated therein.   7.3 Effect
of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Seller, Parent or Buyer as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of Parent, Buyer, or Seller, other than under the last sentence
of Section 5.2, Section 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article 8.   7.4
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in writing by action
of their respective Board of Managers and Board of Directors at any time
before or after any shareholder approvals are obtained and prior to
the filing of the Articles of Merger; however, after Seller\'s shareholders
have approved the Merger, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall
be made which by law requires the further approval of shareholders without
obtaining such further approval. The parties agree to amend this Agreement in
the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence to the extent
required to continue the status of Seller and Parent as REITs.   7.5
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to
the first sentence of Section 7.4, waive compliance with any of the
agreements of or conditions to be satisfied by the other party contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those
rights.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
