Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event no later than ninety (90) days thereafter, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a statement of Closing Net Working Capital, prepared in accordance with GAAP (the " _Statement of Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Buyer shall permit Seller and its accountants to review promptly upon request all records necessary for the preparation by Buyer of such Statement of Closing Net Working Capital and the computation of Closing Net Working Capital and to take copies of the same. 

  

 2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) If Seller disputes the Closing Net Working Capital as calculated by Buyer, not more than 30 calendar days after the date Seller receives such Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a Notice of Dispute. Upon receipt of the Notice of Dispute, Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with each other with respect to the specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by Seller and Buyer within 30 calendar days after Buyer receives the Notice of Dispute, Seller and Buyer shall jointly refer the dispute to the Accountant as an arbitrator to finally resolve, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 45 calendar days after such reference, those items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Notice of Dispute with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital reflected on the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital. For purposes of such arbitration each of Seller and Buyer shall submit a proposed calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. The Accountant shall apply the terms of Section 2.4 of this Agreement, and shall otherwise conduct the arbitration under such procedures as the Parties may agree or, failing such agreement, under the then prevailing Commercial Rules of the American 

    ##### 

  

    

Arbitration Association. Each of the Parties shall bear its own expenses in
connection with the arbitration. The fees and expenses of the Accountant
incurred in connection with the arbitration of the Closing Net
Working Capital shall be allocated fifty percent (50%) to Seller and fifty
percent (50%) to the Buyer; provided, that such fees and expenses shall not
include, so long as a Party complies with the procedures of this Section, the
other Partys outside counsel or accounting fees. All determinations by the
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding with respect to the Closing
Net Working Capital, in the absence of fraud or manifest error. The scope of
the disputes to be arbitrated by the Accountant is limited to whether the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital was done in a manner consistent
with this Agreement and whether there were mathematical errors in the
Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, and the Accountant is not to make
any other determinations, including any determination as to whether GAAP was
followed for the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital or as to whether
the December Net Working Capital is correct. 

   

 (b) The Aggregate Consideration shall be adjusted as follows, based on the Closing Net Working Capital determined pursuant to Sections 2.4 and 2.5: Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the December Net Working Capital, or Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the December Net Working Capital, in either case, plus interest, compounded annually, calculated using a 365 day year from the Closing Date through the date prior to the date of payment at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate reported by the Wall Street Journal under "Money Rates" as of the Closing Date. Any payment so required to be made by either Seller or Buyer shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds, not more than seven (7) Business Days after final determination thereof, to an account to be designated by the payee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the due date. 

   

 (c) The Parties agree that the calculation of the Houston Net Book Value set forth on  _Schedule 1.45_ was prepared by Seller without independent verification by Buyer. During the period in which Buyer is preparing the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital, Buyer and its accountants will also review the information set forth on _Schedule 1.45_. If Buyer believes that there are inaccuracies in _Schedule 1.45_, it will submit those inaccuracies to Seller along with Buyers Statement of Closing Net Working Capital. If Seller disagrees with Buyer, Seller shall have the right to include any disagreement regarding the calculation of the Houston Net Book Value in its Notice of Dispute, and the resolution and final settlement of any such dispute will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5(a) and (b) above. 

   

 (d) The Parties acknowledge that the Aggregate Consideration assumes that prior to Closing none of the Known Environmental Liabilities set forth on _Schedule 1.57_ were corrected or remediated by Seller. The Parties agree that Seller shall have 10 calendar days after the Closing Date to review the Known Environmental Liabilities set forth on _Schedule 1.57_. If Seller believes that it has remediated or corrected any of the Known Environmental Liabilities set forth on _Schedule 1.57_ prior to Closing, Seller will submit a list of those remediated or corrected items to Buyer. Any agreed upon adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration related to Sellers pre-Closing correction or remediation of Known Environmental Liabilities will be paid in accordance with Section 2.5(b) above.

 2.6 _Closing_. The Closing shall take place at 9:00 a.m. on the Closing Date at the offices of Boyar and Miller, 4265 San Felipe, Suite 1200, Houston, Texas, or at such other place as the Parties may agree in writing.

 5.1 _Covenant_. In consideration of the sale of the Purchased Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby: 

  

 (a) Each of Seller, Gilliam, June Roberson and Ann Self (each, a " _Covenantor_ "), agree that he, she or it shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to: 

    

 (i) Directly or indirectly through any entity, as a principal, employee, partner, shareholder, member, officer, director, manager, agent, lender, paid or unpaid consultant or otherwise, compete with, assist in or provide financial resources to any activity which competes with the Business during the Restrictive Period (as defined below) anywhere in the United States and anywhere outside the United States where the Business is currently conducted or as of the Closing Date planned to be conducted; provided, however, that the running of such time period shall be tolled during any period of time during which the Covenantors or any of its Affiliates violates this paragraph, and provided further, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Covenantors or any of their Affiliates from owning 5% or less of the outstanding equity securities of a Public Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer hereby agrees that the foregoing covenant shall not be deemed breached as a result of (A) the ownership by Ann Self or her spouse of a 50% equity interest in J. Hobbs Machine Corp. (" _J-Hobbs_ ") so long as (1) Ann Self does not have any active participation in the business of J-Hobbs and (2) neither Ann Self nor her spouse, directly or indirectly, provides any financial support to J-Hobbs (whether by loan, guarantee, investment or otherwise) which facilitates J-Hobbs engaging 

   ##### 

  

   

in any business enterprise that would be competitive with the business
activities of FTS or Buyer and (B) the ownership by Gilliam, Ann Self and
June Roberson of a 33.3% equity interest in Cromwell Lane Investments Corp.,
a Texas corporation (" _Cromwell Lane_ "), which owns 30% of Composite Lining
Systems, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (" _CLS_ "), so long as Gilliam,
Ann Self or June Roberson does not actively participate in any activity that
is competitive with the Business or provide any financial support to CLS or
Cromwell Lane (whether by loan, guarantee, investment or otherwise) which
facilitates CLS or Cromwell Lane engaging in any business enterprise that
would be competitive with the business activities of FTS or Buyer; 

   

 (ii) Use or disclose to anyone except authorized personnel of the Business, whether or not for such Covenantors benefit or otherwise, any trade secrets or confidential matters concerning the Business, including, without limitation, secrets, customer lists and credit records, employee data, sales representatives and their territories, mailing lists, consultant arrangements, pricing policies, operational methods, marketing plans or strategies, product development and techniques or plans, research and development programs and plans, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans, designs and design projects, software code, any Intellectual Property (unless previously publicly disclosed in a manner which would not and does not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other relevant agreement) and any other research or business information concerning the Business which such Covenantor currently deems to be confidential (whether or not a trade secret under applicable law); or 

   

 (iii) Directly or indirectly, during the Restrictive Period, solicit, encourage to leave employment, or hire any employee of the Business or any person who at the time of proposed hire by a Covenantor had been an employee of the Business within the previous six (6) months, or induce or attempt to induce, or assist anyone else to induce or attempt to induce, any customer of the Business to reduce or discontinue its business with the Business or disclose to anyone else the name and/or requirements of any such customer; provided, however, that the running of such time period shall be tolled during any period of time during which the Covenantor or any of their Affiliates violates this paragraph. 

  

5.2 _Enforceability_. 

  

 (a) Each Covenantor hereby acknowledges the broad territorial scope of the covenant contained in Section 5.1, but acknowledge and agree that the restrictions are reasonable and enforceable in view of, among other things, (i) the narrow range of activities prohibited, (ii) the national and international markets in which the Business operates and in which the products of the Business are sold, (iii) the confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Business to which the Covenantor may have had access and (iv) the fact that a business which competes with the Business could greatly benefit if it were to obtain the confidential information of the Business. 

   

 (b) Each Covenantor acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions are reasonable and agrees that in the event of any breach thereof the harm to Buyer and the Business will be irreparable and without adequate remedy at law and therefore that injunctive relief with 

    ##### 

  

    

respect thereto will be appropriate. In the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, in an action brought by or on behalf of Buyer, that
any of the foregoing provisions are unenforceable as stated, the parties
intend that such restrictions be modified to permit the maximum enforceable
restriction on the Covenantors and their Affiliates competition with the
Business. 

   

 5.3 _Time Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Restrictive Period_ " shall mean a period of five (5) consecutive years from and after the Closing Date.

any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Effective
Time or as a result of this transaction or (ii) for any taxable period
resulting from a breach by Seller and Gilliam of any of the representations or
warranties or covenants contained in Sections 3.5 or 6.2 hereof. Each of
Seller and Gilliam also agrees to jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against any and all
Indemnified Losses sustained by Buyer in a taxable period ending after
the Effective Time that arises out of the settlement or other resolution
(without the consent of Buyer) of a proposed Tax adjustment that relates to a
taxable period ending on or before the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) With respect to any indemnity payment under this Section 9.1, the parties agree to treat, to the extent permitted by Law, all such payments as an adjustment to the consideration paid for the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary, all "material" and "material adverse effect" or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of the indemnification provisions hereof, including, without limitation, for purposes of determining whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred, determining whether the threshold in Section 9.4(a) or Section 9.4(b) has been surpassed and/or determining the amount of any Indemnified Losses. 

   

 9.2 _Indemnification of Seller_. Buyer shall hold Seller and its Affiliates, and their respective members, shareholders, directors, managers, officers, employees, successors, assigns, and agents, harmless and indemnify each of them from and against any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of them resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach or violation of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article IV of this Agreement, (ii) any breach or violation of a covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, or (iv) except to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to be indemnified for such matter pursuant to Section 9.1, the operation of the Business after the Effective Time. With respect to any indemnity payment under this Section 9.2, the parties agree to treat, to the extent permitted by Law, all such payments as an adjustment to the consideration paid for the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets. 

  

 9.3 _Survival_. The respective representations and warranties made by the parties in Article III and Article IV shall survive the Closing Date but shall expire eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, unless a claim with respect thereto shall have been made prior to such date against the party or parties responsible for indemnification hereunder (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in which case such representation and warranty shall survive until such claim is resolved in accordance with the terms hereof, except that: (i) the representations and warranties under Section 3.1 (Existence and Power), Section 3.2 (Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Authorization; Non-contravention), and Section 3.30 (Brokers, Finders and Other 

   ##### 

  

    

Offers) shall survive without expiration; (ii) the representations and
warranties under Section 3.10 (Title to Purchased Assets) shall survive for a
period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, (iii) the
representations and warranties under Section 3.12(e)(i) and
(iii) (Infringement  US Patents), Section 3.12(h)(i) (Intellectual Property
 US Patents) and Section 3.26 (Environmental Matters) shall survive for a
period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, and (iv) the
representations and warranties under Section 3.5 (Taxes) shall survive until
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation, including any
suspensions, tollings or extensions thereof. No party shall be entitled to
indemnification for breach of any representation and warranty set forth in
Article III and Article IV unless a Notice of Claim of such breach has been
given to the Indemnifying Party within the period of survival of such
representation and warranty as set forth herein. 

  

 9.4 _Limitations_. 

  

 (a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification for Indemnified Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) for breaches of the representations and warranties made by the Seller and Gilliam in Article III unless the aggregate amount of such Indemnified Losses exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), but then to the full extent of such Indemnified Losses (including the first $500,000 of such Indemnified Losses). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnification Threshold limitation shall not apply in any manner to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 3.1 (Existence and Power), Section 3.2 (Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Authorization; Non-contravention), Section 3.5 (Taxes), Section 3.10 (Title to Purchased Assets), Section 3.11 (Necessary Property), Section 3.12(e)(i) and (iii) (Infringement  US Patents), Section 3.12(h)(i) (Intellectual Property  US Patents), Section 3.19 (Employee Benefits), Section 3.26 (Environmental Matters) and Section 3.30 (Brokers, Finders and Other Offers). 

   

 (b) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification for Environmental Indemnified Losses (other than the Identified Environmental Matters and the liabilities described in Section 2.2(d)(iii)) unless the aggregate amount of such Environmental Indemnified Losses exceeds $250,000 in the aggregate, in which case the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification of such Environmental Indemnified Losses (including the first $250,000 of such Environmental Indemnified Losses). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to the Identified Environmental Matters (subject to the provisions of Section 9.4(e)) or the liabilities described in Section 2.2(d)(iii) should not be limited by this Section 9.4(b). 

   

 (c) Except as provided in Section 9.4(d), in no event shall Seller or Gilliam have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses with respect to the matters described in Section 9.1(a)(i) hereunder in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate, other than with respect of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 (Existence and Power), Section 3.2 (Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Authorization; Non-contravention), Section 3.5 (Taxes), Section 3.11 (Necessary Property), Section 3.19 (Employee Benefits), and Section 3.30 (Brokers, Finders and Other Offers) (collectively, the " _Key Representations_ ") hereof, and any such Indemnified Losses shall not be counted against such limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller or Gilliam have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to claims 

    ##### 

  

 

for Environmental Indemnified Losses first asserted within the eighteen (18)
month period immediately following the first eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date in excess of an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$5,000,000, and (ii) $10,000,000 less the amount of Indemnified Losses paid
by Seller or Gilliam to the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(i), other than with respect to the Key Representations, prior to the
date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, but not less
than $0. 

   

 (d) In no event shall Seller or Gilliam have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12(e)(i) and (iii) (Infringement  US Patents) and Section 3.12(h)(i) (Intellectual Property  US Patent) (other than and expressly excluding any Past Infringement Claims and Past Validity Claims), together with all other Indemnified Losses indemnified pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) other than with respect to the Key Representations, in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller or Gilliam have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to claims for a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.12(e)(i) and (iii) (Infringement  US Patents) and Section 3.12(h)(i) (Intellectual Property  US Patents) (other than and expressly excluding any Past Infringement Claims and Past Validity Claims) first asserted within the eighteen (18) month period immediately following the first eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date in excess of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $10,000,000, and (ii) $20,000,000 less the amount of Indemnified Losses paid by Seller or Gilliam to the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), other than with respect to the Key Representations, prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, but not less than $0. 

   

 (e) With respect to the Identified Environmental Matters, in no event shall Seller and Gilliam have any obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Indemnified Losses which arise from such Identified Environmental Matters and only with respect to claims asserted by the Buyer Indemnified Person within the three (3) year period following the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) With respect to a breach of the representations and warranties under Section 3.12(e)(i) and (iii), other than and expressly excluding any Past Infringement Claims (a " _Third Party Infringement Claim_ "), Seller and Gilliam shall be obligated to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Persons harmless from and against fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnified Losses which arise from any Third Party Infringement Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Buyer is successful in obtaining a final, non-appealable, judgment in its favor in connection with any Third Party Infringement Claim, Indemnified Losses for purposes of this Section 9.4(f) shall not include any attorneys fees or expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the investigation or defense of such Third Party Infringement Claim. 

   

 (g) With respect to a breach of the representations and warranties under Section 3.12(h)(i), other than and expressly excluding any Past Validity Claims (a " _Third Party Validity Claim_ "), Seller and Gilliam shall be obligated to indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Persons harmless from and against fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnified Losses 

    ##### 

  

 

which arise from any Third Party Validity Claim. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Buyer is successful in
obtaining a final, non-appealable, judgment in its favor in connection with
any Third Party Validity Claim, Indemnified Losses for purposes of this
Section 9.4(g) shall not include any attorneys fees or expenses incurred by
Buyer in connection with the investigation or defense of such Third Party
Validity Claim. 

   

 9.5 _Notice of Claim; Satisfaction of Claim_. Upon obtaining knowledge of any Indemnified Losses, any person entitled to indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.2 (the " _Injured Party_ ") shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted (such written notice being hereinafter referred to as a " _Notice of Claim_ "). If the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim of indemnification, it shall notify the Injured Party thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice of Claim, whereupon the parties shall meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim or indemnification. If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after the parties first meet to attempt such resolution, then either of such parties can bring an Action against the other party to recover such Indemnified Losses in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the Injured Partys claim of indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Injured Partys Notice of Claim. 

  

 9.6 _Environmental Matters_. Any matter for which Seller and Gilliam are to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Person under Section 9.1(a) relating to an environmental issue, including, but not limited to, any matter involving an environmental investigation and/or remediation on any Environmental Property, any claim by the Government relating to an environmental matter, any Identified Environmental Matter, or any breach of a representation or warranty in Section 3.26 (Environmental Matters) (collectively referred to as an " _Environmental Indemnified Loss_ "), shall be governed by this Section 9.6, provided however, any Third Person Claim involving an environmental issue made by a Third Person other than the Government and which does not involve any environmental investigation or remediation on the Environmental Property, shall be governed by Section 9.7. Matters associated with an Environmental Indemnified Loss shall be addressed as follows: 

  

 (a) As between the Parties, Buyer shall have full authority to initiate, control, direct, manage and implement any response or defense to an Environmental Indemnified Loss (collectively, the " _Work_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Work related to any Environmental Indemnified Loss, other than any Identified Environmental Matter, Seller shall have the right to approve the work plan and budget related to such Work, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; 

   

 (b) Buyer shall notify Seller within a reasonable time period of becoming aware of the existence of an Environmental Indemnified Loss, provided that Buyer shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and only to the extent that, Seller is actually and materially prejudiced thereby; 

   

 (c) Buyer shall provide Seller periodic updates of the status of the Work along with summaries of the Indemnified Losses incurred. Buyer shall give good faith consideration to any reasonable comments or suggestions of Seller in connection with the Work. Buyer shall 

  ##### 

  

    

provide Seller with copies of significant written reports and correspondence
to third parties generated as part of the Work. At no time shall Seller
communicate directly to the Government regarding the Work or any
Environmental Indemnified Loss without the prior written consent of Buyer,
nor will Seller take any position with the Government adverse to the interests
of Buyer; 

   

 (d) Any environmental remediation undertaken shall be completed to standards consistent with the propertys use as of the time of Closing, and the Work shall comply with all applicable Environmental Laws; 

   

 (e) Subject to Section 9.4 and this Section 9.6, Seller and Gilliam shall reimburse Buyer in a timely manner for all Indemnified Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Person resulting from or arising out of an Environmental Indemnified Loss; and 

   

 (f) Seller shall cooperate with, and not hinder or impede, Buyer with respect to issues arising from any Environmental Indemnified Loss in which Buyer desires the cooperation of Seller. 

   

 9.7 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_. Except as set forth in Section 9.6 and Section 9.8, if an Injured Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an indemnified Person hereunder (" _Third Person_ "), the Injured Party shall give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after such assertion is actually known to the Injured Party; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such Notice of Claim unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Injured Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Injured Party, to investigate, secure, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ ") provided that the Indemnifying Party notified the Injured Party in writing of its election to indemnify the Injured Party with respect to such Third Person Claim; and provided further that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter or enter into any settlement with respect to the matter without the written consent of the Injured Party (not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably) except that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to consent to any judgment and/or enter into any settlement without the consent of the Injured Party if such judgment or settlement requires only the payment of money. For the avoidance of doubt, a claim or challenge asserted by the Internal Revenue Service against an Injured Party shall be considered a Third Person Claim hereunder. The Injured Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Injured Party with respect to such Third Person Claim, the Injured Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (a) the Injured Party may defend against such claim, in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving written notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Injured Party may 

   ##### 

  

    

deem appropriate; provided that in all cases the Injured Party will not
consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to
be withheld or delayed unreasonably), except that the Injured Party shall be
entitled to consent to any judgment and/or enter into any settlement without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party if such judgment or settlement does not
require the payment of money and (b) the Indemnifying Party may participate
in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at
its own expense. The parties shall make available to each other all relevant
information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and
shall cooperate in the defense thereof. 

  

 9.8 _Third Party Infringement Claim; Third Party Validity Claim_. If a Buyer Indemnified Person believes it is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a Third Party Infringement Claim or a Third Party Validity Claim, the Buyer Indemnified Person shall give Seller and Gilliam prompt written notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Buyer Indemnified Person provided, however, that the right of a Buyer Indemnified Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of a Third Party Infringement Claim or a Third Party Validity Claim shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, Seller or Gilliam is materially prejudiced thereby. Buyer shall administer, pursue and control the defense of all Third Party Infringement Claims and Third Party Validity Claims, utilizing its own counsel. Seller and Gilliam shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such Third Party Infringement Claim and any such Third Party Validity Claim at its own expense. Buyer may settle or compromise any such Third Party Infringement Claim or Third Party Validity Claim without the consent of Seller or Gilliam. Seller and Gilliam shall cooperate with Buyer in the defense of all such Third Party Infringement Claims and Third Party Validity Claims.
