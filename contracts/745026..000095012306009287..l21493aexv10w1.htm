Agreement, to the extent that Buyer is successful in obtaining a final, non-appealable, judgment in

the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted (such written
notice being hereinafter referred to as a &#147;<U>Notice of Claim</U>&#148;). If the Indemnifying Party
disputes such claim of indemnification, it shall notify the Injured Party thereof within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days after receipt of the Notice of Claim, whereupon the parties shall meet and attempt in
good faith to resolve their differences with respect to such claim or indemnification. If the
dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the parties first meet to attempt such
resolution, then either of such parties can bring an Action against the other party to recover such
Indemnified Losses in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Indemnifying Party does not
dispute the Injured Party&#146;s claim of indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount
of any valid claim within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt of the Injured Party&#146;s Notice of Claim.

Section&nbsp;9.8, if an Injured Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim
asserted by any claimant other than an indemnified Person hereunder (&#147;<U>Third Person</U>&#148;), the
Injured Party shall give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after such assertion
is actually known to the Injured Party; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected
by a failure to give such Notice of Claim unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to
the Injured Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Injured Party, to investigate,
secure, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a &#147;<U>Third Person Claim</U>&#148;)
provided that the Indemnifying Party notified the Injured Party in writing of its election to
indemnify the Injured Party with respect to such Third Person Claim; and provided further that the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter or
enter into any settlement with respect to the matter without the written consent of the Injured
Party (not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably) except that the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to consent to any judgment and/or enter into any settlement without the consent of the
Injured Party if such judgment or settlement requires only the payment of money. For the avoidance
of doubt, a claim or challenge asserted by the Internal Revenue Service against an Injured Party
shall be considered a Third Person Claim hereunder. The Injured Party may thereafter participate
in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own
expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case
such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend the Injured Party with respect to such Third Person Claim, the Injured Party
shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter. The failure of
the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the Notice of Claim within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after
receipt thereof shall be deemed an election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person
Claim, (a)&nbsp;the Injured Party may defend against such claim, in
such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving written notice
of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Injured Party may
