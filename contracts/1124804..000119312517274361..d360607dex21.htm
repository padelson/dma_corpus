representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. 

(d) If any objections raised by Seller are not resolved by Agreed Adjustments
within the 30-day period next following such 30-day period, then Buyer and
Seller shall submit the objections that are then unresolved to Deloitte LLP,
or, if Deloitte LLP is unwilling or unable to accept such appointment,
to another national accounting firm acceptable to both Seller and Buyer, and
such firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be directed by Buyer and Seller to
resolve the unresolved objections (based solely on the presentations by Buyer
and by Seller as to whether any disputed matter had been determined in a
manner consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles) as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Buyer and
Seller setting forth its resolution of the disputed matters. The Preliminary
Valuation Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Working Capital, after giving
effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of disputed matters by
the Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding as the " _Valuation Date
Balance Sheet_ " and the Valuation Date Working Capital, respectively, for
purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement.

(e) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyer, Seller and, if
applicable, the Accounting Firm, such books, records and other information

hereunder shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

3.4. _Adjustment_. Promptly (but not later than five days) after the
determination of the Valuation Date Working Capital pursuant to _Section_ __ _

(i) if the Valuation Date Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working
Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account of Seller as Seller shall designate in writing to
Buyer, an amount equal to the excess of the Valuation Date Working Capital
over the Estimated Working Capital; or

 

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Valuation Date Working
Capital, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account of Buyer as Buyer shall designate in writing to
Seller, an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Working Capital over
the Valuation Date Working Capital.

 



18 3.5. _Consents of Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if any assignment or transfer or attempt to
make such an assignment or transfer is not permitted without the consent,
approval or waiver of, or notice to, a third party or would constitute a
breach or violation thereof or affect adversely the rights of Buyer or the
applicable Seller Party thereunder. Seller shall, or shall cause the
applicable Seller Parties to, use commercially reasonable efforts (including
the dedication of resources thereto, but without any obligation to expend any
material amount of money, commence litigation or offer or grant any material
financial or other accommodation to any third party), and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller, to obtain the consent, approval or waiver
of, or provide the required notice to, such third parties to or of the
assignment to the Buyer of any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or otherwise transfer the rights and benefits of
any Non-assignable Asset (as defined below) to Buyer. If such
consent, approval or waiver is not obtained, or such notice is not made on or
before the Closing Date, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of any Seller Party or any of
its or their Affiliates thereunder so that the Buyer would not in fact
receive all such rights, or if such asset is not transferable under applicable
Requirements of Law with or without such consent, approval, waiver or notice
(any assets so described, the " _Non-assignable Assets_"), Seller shall, or
shall cause the applicable Seller Parties to, use commercially reasonable
efforts (but without any obligation to expend a material amount of money,
commence litigation or offer or grant any material financial or other
accommodation to any third party), and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller, to (i) obtain such required consent, approval, waiver or notice as
soon as practical following the Closing Date, (ii) provide to Buyer the
benefits of the applicable Non-assignable Assets to the extent such provision
would not violate any third party right; _provided_ that Buyer shall fulfill
the corresponding obligations to the extent the Buyer would have been
responsible therefor if such consent, approval, waiver or notice had been
obtained and such Non-assignable Assets assigned to Buyer, (iii) cooperate in
any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to
Buyer and (iv) enforce at the request of Buyer and for the account of Buyer
any rights of the Seller Parties arising from any such Non-assignable Assets
(including the right to elect to terminate any Seller Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof upon the request of Buyer). In connection with any such
arrangement, Buyer shall reimburse the applicable Seller Party and each of
their applicable Affiliates for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses actually incurred by the applicable Seller Party and each
of their applicable Affiliates in connection with the performance of any such
Non-assignable Assets, but only to the extent that such out-of-pocket costs
and expenses would have been otherwise incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates had
such Non-assignable Asset been assigned, transferred or conveyed
as contemplated by this Agreement, including any liability arising out of
Buyers failure to perform thereunder (such costs and expenses, the "
_Alternative Arrangement_ _Costs_ "). Seller shall, or shall cause
the applicable Seller Party to, promptly pay to Buyer when received all
monies received (other than Taxes that are the obligation of the applicable
Seller Party to remit to the relevant Governmental Body), after offsetting
applicable Alternative Arrangement Costs incurred but not yet reimbursed by
Buyer or its Affiliates, by such Seller Party under such Non-assignable Asset
or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ shall limit the
obligations of the Seller Parties under the Transition Services Agreement.

 



19 3.6. _Unintentional Transfers; Additional Purchased Assets_.

 

(a) To the extent that right, title or interest to any asset, property or
right which was not used in connection with the Business on the Closing Date,
or which is an Excluded Asset, is acquired by the Buyer or any assignee of the
Buyer under this Agreement (directly or indirectly), (i) the Buyer agrees to,
or cause any applicable assignee of the Buyer to, promptly transfer any
such asset, property or right for nominal consideration to the Seller or
Affiliate of the Seller as the Seller may specify and (ii) to the extent
permitted by Requirements of Law, such asset, property or right shall be held
in trust for Seller or its Affiliate pending such transfer. Seller shall be
responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with the transfer contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_.

(b) To the extent that any properties, assets, rights or interests primarily
related to or primarily used in the Business are owned by an Affiliate of
Seller that is not a Seller Party, they shall be included within the defined
term "Purchased Assets" for purposes hereof, if they would have been so
included pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ if owned by any Seller Party, and
Seller shall cause such Affiliate to convey such properties, assets, rights
and interests to Buyer.

 

3.7. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within 60 days following the
determination of the Valuation Date Working Capital pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3_, Buyer shall provide to Seller a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_
") allocating the final Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets. The
Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code. If Seller does not provide notice of
disagreement to Buyer within 30 days of receiving the Allocation Schedule, the
Allocation Schedule shall be binding as the final Allocation Schedule (the
Allocation Schedule, as finalized pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, the "
_Final Allocation Schedule_ "). If Seller provides notice of disagreement to
Buyer within such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall discuss in good faith
Sellers disagreement and, if Seller and Buyer resolve such disagreement
within 30 days (or longer prior as agreed between the parties) of
Seller receiving the Allocation Schedule, the Allocation Schedule shall be
revised to reflect such resolution and as so revised shall be the Final
Allocation Schedule. The parties agree (and agree to cause each of their
respective Affiliates) to utilize the allocation set forth in any Final
Allocation Schedule for all Tax purposes, including the filing of all Tax
Returns and in the course of all Tax-related proceedings, unless otherwise
required by applicable Requirements of Law pursuant to a final determination
in connection therewith. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve such
disagreements within such 30 days (or longer period as agreed between the
parties), each of Seller and Buyer shall be entitled to determine and
allocate the final Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets in the manner it
determines in its sole discretion, and neither party shall have any liability
to the other with respect to such allocations.

The Seller has delivered certain disclosure Schedules referenced herein
contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement. For purposes of
_Article V_ , any matter disclosed in any Schedule shall be deemed to be
disclosed for purposes of all other applicable sections of _Article V_ to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is relevant
to such other sections or subsections. The Schedules may contain information
that is not specifically required by this Agreement. Any such information is
provided solely for Buyers general information and shall not, and shall not
be deemed to, expand the scope of the representations set forth in this
_Article V_. The inclusion of any such information in the Schedules shall not
be evidence of or constitute an admission that such information is material
for purposes of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the Schedules referred
to herein and delivered to Buyer contemporaneously herewith, and in the
documents and other materials identified in the Schedules, and subject to the
limitations contained in _Article XI_ , the Seller represents and warrants to
Buyer as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date follows:

5.1. _Organization of the Seller Parties_. Each Seller Party is a corporation
or other business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation. Except as would not have a
material and adverse impact on the ability of the Seller Parties to conduct
the Business, each Seller Party is duly qualified to transact business as a
foreign corporation or other business entity and is in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which the ownership or leasing of the Purchased
Assets or the conduct of the

 



22 Business requires such qualification. No other jurisdiction has demanded,
requested or otherwise indicated that any Seller Party is required so to
qualify on account of the ownership or leasing of the Purchased Assets or the
conduct of the Business. The Seller Parties have full power and authority to
own or lease and to operate and use the Purchased Assets and to carry on the
Business as now conducted. Each Seller Party and its jurisdiction of formation
are listed in _Schedule 5.1_. All powers of attorney granted by any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries prior to the Closing will terminate and be of no effect
following the Closing.

5.2. _Subsidiaries and Investments_. Seller does not, directly or indirectly
own, of record or beneficially, any outstanding voting securities or other
equity interests in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other entity which is primarily engaged in Business or holds
any Purchased Assets other than those of the other Seller Parties. Each of
Nant Health Canada and Nant Health UK is a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of
Seller. The authorized share capital of Nant Health Canada is unlimited, and
10,001 shares are issued and outstanding. Nant Health UK is not required
under applicable Requirements of Laws to designate the number of its
authorized shares, and one share is issued and outstanding. In the case of
each of Nant Health Canada and Nant Health UK, all equity interests (i) have
been duly issued in compliance with all Requirements of Laws and are
outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable, and (ii) at the Closing Date,
such shares will be duly issued in compliance with all Requirements of Laws
and will be outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable. Seller owns 49,999
shares of Nant Health India and 1 share of Nant Health India is owned by a
director nominee as required by applicable law. The Acquired Subsidiaries do
not, directly or indirectly own, of record or beneficially, any outstanding
voting securities or other equity interests in any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.

5.3. _Authority of Seller_.

 

(a) Seller and each other Seller Party has full power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and all of the Seller Ancillary
Agreements. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Seller Ancillary Agreements by Seller and, as applicable, each other Seller
Party, have been duly authorized and approved by Sellers and, as
applicable, each other Seller Partys board of directors and do not require
any further authorization or consent of any Seller Party or their respective
equityholders. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by Seller and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and each of the Seller Ancillary
Agreements has been duly authorized by Seller and, as applicable, each other
Seller Party thereto, and upon execution and delivery by the applicable
Seller Party will be a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller
Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Seller
Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with or fulfillment of the
terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof will:

 



23 (i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights
of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a change in rights under, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the
Purchased Assets, under (A) the charter or by-laws of any Seller Party, (B)
any Seller Agreement, (C) any other material note, instrument, agreement,

correspondence and other materials related to all such applications and
registrations in Sellers possession or control, to the extent the foregoing
materials are not publicly available.

(b) _Schedule 5.11(B)_ sets forth a complete and accurate list (showing in
each case any owner, licensor or licensee) of all material Software owned by,
licensed to or used by the Seller Parties primarily related to the Business ("
_Business Software_ "); _provided_ that, except for any Software included
in the Business Software that is owned by a third party and licensed or
sublicensed to a Seller Party and is incorporated into or distributed with any
Owned Software, _Schedule 5.11(B)_ does not list mass market Software licensed
to any Seller Party that is commercially available and subject to "shrink-
wrap" or "click-through" license agreements.

(c) The Intellectual Property (including Business Registered IP and Business
Software) included in the Purchased Assets constitutes all of the material

is owned, or purported to be owned, by a Seller Party and is primarily related

its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with or fulfillment of the
terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof will:

 



38 (i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights
of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under (A) the
charter or by-laws of Buyer, (B) any material note, instrument, agreement,
mortgage, lease, license, franchise, permit or other authorization, right,
restriction or obligation to which Buyer is a party or any of its properties
is subject or by which Buyer is bound, (C) any Court Order to which Buyer is
a party or by which it is bound or (D) any Requirements of Laws affecting
Buyer; or

(ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by
Buyer of any declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Body.

 

6.3. _NantHealth Shares_. Buyer is the sole beneficial owner of and has good

Encumbrances, except for Permitted Share Restrictions. Buyer has not granted,
and there does not exist, any option or other purchase right, agreement,
arrangement or commitment of any character relating to the NantHealth Shares.
Upon delivery to Seller on the Closing Date of the NantHealth Shares
Assignment, duly executed by Buyer, and original share certificates
representing the NantHealth Shares, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, Buyer
will thereby transfer to Seller good and marketable title to the NantHealth
Shares, subject to no Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. Other
than the NantHealth Shares, Buyer does not have any other equity interest in
Seller.

 

6.4. _No Finder_. Neither Buyer nor any Person acting on its behalf has paid
or become obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or
intermediary for or on account of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.5.  _Disclaimer_. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE V_ , NO SELLER PARTY IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RESPECTING THE PURCHASED ASSETS,
AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER MATTER.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any
cost estimates, financial or other projections or other predictions that may
be contained or referred to, as well as any information, documents or other
materials are not and will not be deemed to be representations or warranties
of Seller except to the extent expressly set forth in _ARTICLE V_.

_Article VI_ , neither Buyer nor any Person on behalf of Buyer makes any
representation or warranty, express or implied, in respect of Buyer or, except

39 ARTICLE VII

 

 _ACTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE_

 

The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions
between the date hereof and the Closing Date:

 

7.1. _Mutual Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Articles IX_ and _X_
, respectively, to be satisfied on a timely basis. Subject to the
confidentiality undertaking in _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, Seller shall afford the
officers, employees and authorized representatives of Buyer (including
independent public accountants and attorneys) such reasonable access during
normal business hours as Buyer shall reasonably request, upon reasonable prior
notice and in such a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the Seller
Parties businesses, to the Transferred Leased Real Property, Business
Employees and business and financial records (including computer files,
retrieval programs and similar documentation) primarily related to the
Business and shall furnish to Buyer or its authorized representatives such
additional information concerning the Purchased Assets, the Business and the
operations of Seller primarily related to the Business as shall be reasonably
requested. Buyer shall not have access to matters, the disclosure of which
would, upon the good faith advice of counsel to Seller, adversely affect
attorney-client privilege possessed any Seller Party or any of their
Affiliates or violate any Requirements of Law. Buyer will not communicate
with any employees, suppliers or customers of the Business relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder without first obtaining
the prior written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), which consent may require that the
communication be undertaken jointly with the Seller.

7.2.  _Preserve Accuracy of Representations and Warranties; Notification of_
_Certain Matters_.

(a) Each party hereto shall refrain from taking any action which would render
any representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ or _VI_ inaccurate as
of the Closing Date. Each party shall promptly notify the other of any action,
suit or proceeding that shall be instituted or threatened against such party
to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) During the period prior to the Closing Date, Seller will notify Buyer
promptly upon the occurrence, to the Knowledge of Seller, of (i) any Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation that is
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against Seller which would have
been disclosed under _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding
or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof, (iii) any notice or
other communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such
third Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) any material default under any Seller
Agreement or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become
such a default on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



40 7.3. _Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) Seller will act diligently and reasonably in attempting to obtain, before
the Closing Date, the consent, approval or waiver, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, from any party to any Seller Agreement
required to be obtained to assign or transfer any such Seller Agreements to
Buyer or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
9.5_; _provided_ that neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligation to
offer or pay any consideration in order to obtain any such consents or
approvals; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall not make any
agreement or understanding affecting the Purchased Assets or the Business as a
condition for obtaining any such consents or waivers except with the prior
written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may withhold consent, in its
sole discretion, in connection with any proposed condition that would limit
the future operation of Buyers or its Affiliates respective
businesses, including the Business, in any material respect or impose
additional material costs on Buyer). During the period prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall act diligently and reasonably to cooperate with Seller in
attempting to obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_.

(b) During the period prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall each
cooperate with the other and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents and approvals of any Governmental Body required to be obtained by
them in order to assign or transfer any Governmental Permits to Buyer, to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
to otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_;
_provided_ that Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding
affecting the Purchased Assets or the Business as a condition for obtaining
any such consents or approvals except with the prior written consent of Buyer
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Buyer may withhold consent, in its sole discretion, in
connection with any proposed condition that would limit the future operation
of Buyers or its Affiliates respective businesses, including the Business,
in any material respect or impose additional material costs on Buyer).

7.4. _Operations Prior to the Closing Date_.

 

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause the other Seller Parties to, operate and
carry on the Business only in the ordinary course and in all material
respects as presently operated. Consistent with the foregoing, Seller shall,
and shall cause the other Seller Parties to, use commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with good business practice to keep and maintain the
Purchased Assets in good operating condition and repair and use commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with good business practice to maintain the
Business intact and to preserve the goodwill of the suppliers, contractors,
licensors, Business Employees, customers, distributors and others having
business relations with the Business. In connection therewith, the Seller
shall not, and shall cause the other Seller Parties to not, with respect to
any Business Employee (i) transfer such Business Employee to another business
unit of Seller, (ii) offer such Business Employee employment by another
business unit of Seller or its Affiliate after the Closing Date or (iii)
otherwise attempt to persuade any such Business Employee to terminate his or
her relationship with the Seller Parties or not to commence employment with
Buyer after the Closing.

 



41 (b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_, except as described in
_Schedule 7.4_ or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or except with
the express written approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Seller shall not, and shall cause the other Seller
Parties to not:

 

(i) make any material change in the Business or the operations of the Seller
Parties with respect to the Business;

 

(ii) make any capital expenditure (including capitalized software) with
respect to the Business or enter into any contract or commitment therefor;

(iii) enter into any contract, agreement, undertaking or commitment which
would have been required to be set forth in _Schedule 5.16_ if in effect on
the date hereof or enter into any contract which cannot be assigned to Buyer
or a permitted assignee of Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 13.5_;

 

(iv) enter into any contract for the purchase of real property to be used in
the Business or any option to extend a lease listed in _Schedule 5.10(B)_ ;

(v) sell, lease (as lessor), transfer or otherwise dispose of (including any
transfers by Seller to any of its Affiliates), or mortgage or pledge, or
impose or suffer to be imposed any Encumbrance on, any of the Purchased
Assets, other than inventory and minor amounts of personal property sold or
otherwise disposed of for fair value in the ordinary course of the Business
consistent with past practice and other than Permitted Encumbrances;

(vi) cancel any debts owed to or claims held by the Business (including the
settlement of any claims or litigation) other than in the ordinary course of
the Business consistent with past practice;

 

(vii) create, incur or assume, or agree to create, incur or assume, any
Indebtedness that would give rise to any lien on the Purchased Assets;

(viii) accelerate or delay collection of any notes or accounts receivable
generated by the Business in advance of or beyond their regular due dates or
the dates when the same would have been collected in the ordinary course of
the Business consistent with past practice;

 

(ix) delay or accelerate payment of any account payable or other liability of
the Business beyond or in advance of its due date or the date when such
liability would have been paid in the ordinary course of the Business
consistent with past practice;

 

(x) make, or agree to make, any distribution of any assets that would
otherwise be Purchased Assets to Seller or any of its Affiliates;

(xi) make any material change in the compensation or benefits of the Business
Employees;

 



42 (xii) terminate any Business Employees for a reason other than cause;

 

(xiii) prepare or file any Tax Return inconsistent with past practice or, on
any such Tax Return, take any position, make any election, or adopt any
method that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing or filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, in each case
to the extent doing so would affect the Taxes payable by the Buyer or the
Acquired Subsidiaries after the Closing Date; or

(xiv) make any change in the accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the financial statements contained in _Schedule 5.4_; or

(xv) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

7.5. _Acquisition Proposals_. Seller will not, and will not authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
or authorize any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or encourage, or furnish information with respect to the
Business to or engage in any discussions with any Person in connection with,
any proposal for the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the
Business, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will promptly
cease or cause to be terminated any existing activities or discussions with
any Person with respect to any of the foregoing and will promptly request the
return of any confidential information provided to any Person in connection
with a prospective acquisition of the Business, other than Buyer.

7.6. _No Transfer of NantHealth Shares_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer will not,
and will not authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer, to sell, assign, encumber, hypothecate, pledge,
convey in trust, gift, transfer by bequest, devise, or otherwise dispose of,
including transfer to a receiver, levying creditor, trustee or receiver in
bankruptcy proceedings or general assignee for the benefit of creditors,
whether voluntary or by operation of law, directly or indirectly (excluding
the transfer of securities issued by Buyer), the NantHealth Shares, other
than with respect to Permitted Share Restrictions.

7.7. _Schedule Updates_. From time to time prior to the Closing (in each case
within three business days after Seller becomes aware of the New Matter or New
Matters set forth therein), Seller shall have the right to deliver to Buyer a
supplement or amendment to the Schedules (a " _Proposed Update_ "). If,
concurrently with the delivery of such Proposed Update, Seller informs Buyer
in writing that, as a result of any New Matter or New Matters set forth in
such Proposed Update, the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ will
not be satisfied at the Closing without a supplement to the Schedules to
reflect the New Matter(s) set forth in the Proposed Update, Buyer shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)_
(disregarding the cure period set forth therein) within five business days
following its receipt of such Proposed Update. If Buyer fails to terminate
this Agreement within such five-business-day period, then such Proposed
Update shall amend the Schedules (including the underlying representations and
warranties and for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 9.1_) and shall be deemed a "
_Disclosure Supplement_ ", and Buyer will be deemed to have waived any right
to indemnification pursuant to Section _11.1(a)(i)_ with respect to the New
Matters set forth in such Disclosure Supplement. For avoidance of doubt, a
Proposed Update shall not operate to amend

 



43 the Schedules in any respect (and shall not be deemed a Disclosure Supplement)
(a) if concurrently with the delivery of such Proposed Update, Seller does
not inform Buyer in writing that, as a result of any New Matter or New Matters
set forth in such Proposed Update, the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.1_ will not be satisfied at the Closing or (b) with respect to any matter
that is not a New Matter, irrespective of whether Seller informs Buyer that as
a result of such matter the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ will
not be satisfied. 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

8.1. _Covenant Not to Compete or Solicit Business_.

 

(a) In furtherance of the sale of the Purchased Assets and the Business to
Buyer hereunder by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and more
effectively to protect the value and goodwill of the Purchased Assets and the
Business so sold, Seller covenants and agrees that, for a period ending on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries will:

(i) market to any health system customer any Software that is competitive with
the Software included in the Business, except as contemplated by the Reseller
Agreement Amendment;

(ii) solicit, induce or attempt to persuade any agent, supplier or customer
of the Business to terminate or reduce or limit such agency or business
relationship; or

(iii) hire any employee on _Schedule 8.1(A)(iii)_ or solicit, induce or
attempt to persuade or assist any employee of the Business to leave the
employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing restriction shall not prohibit a general solicitation through
the media that is not targeted at employees of the Business;

Seller also covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing Date, it
will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, divulge or make use of
any trade secrets or other confidential information of the Business other than
to disclose such secrets and information to Buyer or its Affiliates.

(b) If Seller or any Affiliate of Seller violates any of its obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Buyer may proceed against it in law or in equity
for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Seller
acknowledges that a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ may cause Buyer
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Seller therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Buyer shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary restraining order
and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against Seller or such
Affiliate of Seller to prevent any violations of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
without the necessity of posting a bond. The prevailing party in any action
commenced under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall also be entitled to receive
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs. It is the intent and understanding
of each party hereto that if, in any action before any court or agency
legally empowered to enforce this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, any term, restriction,
covenant or promise in this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ is found to be unreasonable
and for that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or
promise shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable by such court or agency.

 



44 8.2. _Use of Names_. For a period of six months after the Closing Date, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall have the royalty-free right to refer to the Business
as "formerly "NantHealth" and to use such reference in a reasonable and
limited manner in advertising or in the description or name of any service or
product from time to time purchased or sold by Buyer and its Affiliates in
continuation of the Business. For a period of six months after the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the further royalty-free right to
sell or otherwise use or dispose of any materials which bear the name "Nant"
or "NantHealth" alone or in combination with other words if such materials (i)
were included in the Purchased Assets, (ii) are returned to Buyer or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date or (iii) were contracted for by the Seller
Parties prior to the Closing Date. Buyer and its Affiliates shall also have
the royalty-free right from and after the Closing Date to use, for a period of
three months following the Closing Date, any signs or other supplies which
bear the name "Nant" or "NantHealth" alone or in combination with other words
if such signs or supplies (i) were included in the Purchased Assets, or (ii)
were contracted for by the Seller Parties prior to the Closing Date.

8.3. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Seller shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes (whether assessed or
unassessed) (i) relating to or imposed on Seller for any Taxable year or
period, (ii) relating to or arising out of the ownership or operation of the
Purchased Assets or Business on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) imposed on
any Acquired Subsidiary, or for which an Acquired Subsidiary may otherwise be
liable, as a result of having been a member of an Affiliated Tax Group, (iv)
imposed on any Acquired Subsidiary, or for which an Acquired Subsidiary may
otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, or (v) imposed
on Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or for which Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer may otherwise be liable, as a result of Buyer or such Affiliate taking
into account Subpart F income (within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code)
related to income of an Acquired Subsidiary for any taxable year or period
that ends on or before the Closing Date or, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date, except in each case to the extent such Taxes are individually identified
and reflected as a dollar amount in the Valuation Date Working Capital. Buyer
shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes (whether assessed or unassessed)
relating to or arising out of the ownership or operation of the Purchased
Assets or Business after the Closing Date, provided that Buyer shall not be
liable for any Taxes for which Seller is liable under this Agreement. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, in the case of (x) any Taxes that are
imposed in part on the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or
Business on or prior to the Closing Date, and in part on the ownership or
operation of the Purchased Assets or Business after the Closing Date or (y)
any Taxes imposed with respect to any Straddle Period of an Acquired
Subsidiary, such Taxes shall be allocated between the period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the period beginning after the Closing Date on
a "closing of the books" basis, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions
or Taxes that are calculated on a period basis (such as property Taxes and
depreciation or amortization deductions) shall be allocated on a daily basis.
Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes imposed on Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer with respect to Subpart F or other income of an

 



45 Acquired Subsidiary with respect to the portion of a Straddle Period of an
Acquired Subsidiary ending on and including the Closing Date, the
determination of liability for any such Taxes shall be made by assuming that
the Straddle Period of the Acquired Subsidiary consisted of two taxable years
or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of
which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and
relevant items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Acquired
Subsidiary shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on
a "closing of the books" basis by assuming that the books of the Acquired
Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Closing Date, except that
exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on a period basis
(such as depreciation or amortization deductions) shall be allocated on a
daily basis.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_, any sales Tax, use Tax, real
property transfer or gains Tax, documentary stamp Tax or similar Tax
attributable to the sale or transfer of the Business, the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities shall be paid equally by Seller and Buyer, except that
any stamp duty imposed on the transfer of the Acquired Subsidiaries shall be
paid by Seller. Buyer and Seller each agree to timely sign and deliver such
certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns with respect to,
such Taxes.

(c) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide reimbursement for any
Tax paid by one party all or a portion of which is the responsibility of the
other party in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_. Within
a reasonable time prior to the payment of any said Tax, the party paying such
Tax shall give notice to the other party of the Tax payable and the portion
which is the liability of each party, although failure to do so will not
relieve the other party from its liability hereunder.

 

(d) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall (and cause their
respective Affiliates to):

 

(i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing;

 

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Business, the Purchased Assets
or the Acquired Subsidiaries;

(iii) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Acquired Subsidiaries;

 

(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to Taxes of the Business or the
Purchased Assets, including the Acquired Subsidiaries, for which the other may
have a liability under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_; and

 

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period.

 



46 (e) Seller and Buyer agree that no proceeds shall be received or receivable by
Seller as consideration in respect of the non-compete covenants contained in
this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be
unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to
time.

 

8.4. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Buyer shall (i) with respect to employees employed by the Acquired
Subsidiaries, continue the employment of the individuals listed
as "continuing employees" on _Schedule 8.4(A)_ as of immediately following
the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), and (ii) with respect to
employees employed by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Subsidiaries), offer, or cause Buyers Affiliates to offer,
employment as of the Closing Date to each other Business Employee listed on
_Schedule 8.4(A)_ , but only if such Business Employee is actively employed
(including employees on vacation, holiday, jury duty or other similar
absence) immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer also shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, offer employment to each Business Employee who is not
actively employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and who is able to
return to active employment within three months after the Closing Date, or
such longer period during which the Business Employee has a right of re-
instatement in accordance with applicable Requirements of Laws (collectively,
" _Inactive Business Employees_ "), in each case promptly upon his or her
return from any leave or other absence. The Continuing Employees and the other
Business Employees who accept an employment offer from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and commence employment as of the Closing Date are referred to
collectively herein as the " _Transferred Employees_ ", and any Inactive
Business Employee shall be treated as a Transferred Employee upon his or her
return to, or commencement of, active employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.

(b) Buyer will, immediately following the Closing Date, provide each
Transferred Employee with (i) at least the same base salary or base wage rate
(as applicable) and bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, as Seller currently
offers, and (ii) employee benefits (with credit for their prior service with
Seller) which are in the aggregate substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those made available either to such Transferred Employee immediately prior
to the Closing or to similarly situated employees of Buyer.

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer will recognize each Transferred
Employees prior service with the Seller for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and determination of level of vacation, other paid time
off or severance benefits and as may otherwise be required by applicable
statute for Transferred Employees who are Canadian Business Employees (but
not for other purposes, including benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan, or to the extent that such recognition would result in
duplication of benefits).

 

(d) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause each Transferred Employee to be
fully vested in his or her account under any 401(k) or similar U.S.
retirement plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates.

 



47 (e) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to transition and rollover all vacation
or paid time off that is accrued but unused as of the Closing Date for each
Transferred Employee to the extent consistent with applicable Requirements of
Laws, including if required by obtaining a consent from such Transferred
Employee, and Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Subsidiary to,
acknowledge, assume and continue all such transitioned and rolled over accrued
vacation or paid time off. As soon as administratively practicable after the
Closing Date, to the extent required by the applicable Requirements of Laws
and to the extent such vacation or paid time off is not otherwise transitioned
or rolled over, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee all of such
Transferred Employees vacation or paid time that is accrued but unused as of
the Closing Date.

(f) Seller shall be solely responsible for offering continuation coverage to
Transferred Employees, to the extent required, pursuant to the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.

(g) Following the Closing, Seller will retain (i) all liabilities and
obligations under each Seller Plan other than the Assumed Benefit Plans, and
any other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained or
contributed to by Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) all other liabilities and
obligations including any severance payments whether pursuant to Requirements
of Law or contract, salary, wages, bonuses, commissions, vacation with pay, or
sick day obligations, in each case, with respect to any current or former
employee or service provider who is not, or does not become, a Transferred
Employee, and (iii) all liabilities and obligations with respect to any
Transferred Employee relating to the period prior to Closing including but
not limited to any amounts or benefits payable to the Transferred Employee in
respect of employment prior to Closing.

(h) Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall (i) be construed as requiring
the continued employment or engagement of any Transferred Employee or other
service provider after the Closing Date, (ii) be construed as requiring Buyer
to retain any current employee of Seller or its Affiliates other than the
Transferred Employees or (iii) create any third-party rights under this
Agreement for any Transferred Employee or any other current or former employee
of the Business.

 

8.5. _SEC Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Seller shall obtain and deliver to Buyer by the date that is 70 days after
the Closing, (i) audited financial statements for the Business for the year
ended December 31, 2016 (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), and (ii)
unaudited year-to-date financial statements for the most recently completed
quarterly period prior to Closing (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ "
and, together with the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Rule  3-05
Financial Statements_"). Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer
regarding other financial information relating to the Business that may be
required in connection with any filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by Buyer after the Closing.

 



48 (b) The Rule 3-05 Financial Statements will be (i) prepared in accordance
with the books and records of the Business, (ii) prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-X and United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ "), (iii) prepared as either (x) carve-out financial statements or (y)
abbreviated financial statements to the extent Buyer requests and receives
pre-clearance from the SEC to use such abbreviated financial statements in any
reports and registration statements of Buyer and (iv) in the case of the
Audited Financial Statements, accompanied by an opinion (the " _Audit
Opinion_ ") of Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), which
opinion complies with Regulation S-X. Seller agrees to provide Buyer with an
opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Rule 3-05 Financial
Statements, the form and substance of which shall be reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, and with reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of the
Business and Seller and all documents, schedules and work papers that are
reasonably necessary for purposes of such review.

 

(c) To the extent Buyer is required to file the Rule 3-05 Financial Statements
with the SEC under applicable Requirements of Law, then (i) Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to request pre-clearance from the SEC to
file the Rule 3-05 Financial Statements in the form of abbreviated financial
statements rather than carve-out financial statements and (ii) Seller will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor
to provide to Buyer no later than five business days prior to the required
filing date of the Rule 3-05 Financial Statements the consents necessary to
permit the inclusion of the Audit Opinion with respect to the Audited
Financial Statements in any reports and registration statements of Buyer.

(d) Whether or not Buyer is ultimately required to file the Rule 3-05
Financial Statements with the SEC under applicable Requirements of Law, Buyer
shall reimburse Seller within 30 days of receipt of detailed invoices for all
reasonable internal and out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by
Seller in connection with the preparation of the Rule 3-05 Financial
Statements and the Audit Opinion, including any such costs, fees and expenses
paid or payable to third party consultants (in each case, without markup and
on a pass-through basis); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have no
obligation to reimburse Seller hereunder if the Rule 3-05 Financial
Statements are not delivered to Buyer on or before the date that is 70 days

8.6. _Obligations Regarding Deferred Revenue_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall or shall cause its
Affiliates to promptly perform all obligations in respect of any arrangements
that (1) have given rise to deferred revenue attributable to the Business as
of the Closing Date and (2) are identified on _Schedule 8.6(A)_ (as updated
prior to the Closing in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.6(c)_); _provided_
, _however_ , that if requested by Seller, Buyer shall contract with Seller to
satisfy such obligations on Sellers behalf (and the terms of any such
agreement shall include (a) a service fee in an amount equal to the sum of
(i) all internal and reasonably detailed costs of Buyer directly allocable to
the provision of such services, plus (ii) all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the provision
of such service, plus (iii) an additional 25% margin on clauses (i) and (ii),
(b) customary quarterly invoicing with 45 day payment terms and (c) such
other terms as may be agreed between Buyer and Seller, which, to the extent
applicable shall be substantially similar to the terms and conditions set

the outstanding implementation and software development projects that are
classified as deferred revenue liabilities in accordance with the Agreed

 



49 Accounting Principles by Seller as of June 30, 2017, including a reasonably
detailed description of each project and the Sellers good faith estimate of
the time to complete such projects. Without the prior written consent of
Seller, Seller shall not be responsible for the fulfillment of any deferred
revenue liabilities in respect of arrangements that are entered into on or
after the Closing Date by Buyer or in respect of the incremental portion of
any amendments to arrangements existing as of the Closing agreed to by Buyer.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer does not expect to incur, on
an aggregate basis, a loss fulfilling the unbilled portion of
the implementation and software development services (excluding maintenance
and SaaS services) of any contracts with customers of the Business in effect
as of the Closing Date and as listed on _Schedule 8.6(B)_ (as updated prior to
the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.6(c))_. To the extent that
Buyers aggregate costs to fulfill such obligations under all such contracts
exceed the sum of (i) the aggregate billable amounts attributable to the
component of such contracts for such services plus (ii) the aggregate amounts
payable by Seller to Buyer for such fulfillment, Seller shall pay to Buyer
fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such excess without any additional
markup. Buyer and Seller agree to discuss in good faith the basis and manner
of calculating the amount of any such aggregate loss and Buyer agrees to make
available to Seller any and all records relating to the costs of fulfilling
such obligations in connection therewith. 

(c) On or prior to the third business day prior to the Closing (but no earlier
than five business days prior to the Closing), Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer in good faith updated versions of _Schedule 8.6(A)_ and
_Schedule 8.6(B)_ reflecting outstanding implementation and software
development projects as of such date, which Buyer shall review in good faith.
Upon Buyers and Sellers reasonable agreement upon the updated _Schedule
8.6(A)_ and _Schedule 8.6(B)_ , such updated versions shall be deemed the
final versions of _Schedule 8.6(A)_ and _Schedule 8.6(B)_ for the purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_.

8.7. _Acquired Subsidiary Wind Down Costs_. From and after the Closing, Buyer
may wind-down, liquidate and dissolve the Acquired Subsidiaries (any such
winding-down, liquidation or dissolution (or similar outcome in accordance
with applicable Requirements of Laws), an " _Acquired Subsidiary Wind-Down_
"). Seller shall, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, reimburse
Buyer and its Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs or expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection such Acquired Subsidiary Wind-Downs exceeding $50,000
in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such costs or expenses
exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate shall be born equally by Seller and Buyer;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall have no liability under this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.7_ in connection with any costs or expenses incurred in
connection with any Acquired Subsidiary Wind- Down after the second
anniversary of the Closing Date. Buyer shall give written notice to Seller
reasonably promptly following any Acquired Subsidiary Wind-Down (including a
description of reimbursable costs and expenses) if Buyer seeks reimbursement
of costs and expenses hereunder, in which case Seller shall, within 30 days of
receiving such written notice, pay all reimbursements to Buyer in immediately
available funds.

11.3. _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification
hereunder (or believing in good faith that it may suffer or incur Losses or
Expenses for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder) (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give to the party obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder (a " _Claim Notice_ ") as promptly as practicable
and shall include in such Claim Notice (to the extent then known) the amount
or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to
the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based;
_provided_ that failure timely to give such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree
of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined.

(c) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance
recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue
hereunder to any insurer).

11.4. _Third Person Claims_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise or settlement of any pending or threatened action at law or suit in
equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought
(each such action or suit being a " _Third Person Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by any
Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the
Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; _provided_ , that:

 



55 (i) the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its
own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to which the
Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof;
and

 

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), pay,
compromise or settle any such Third Person Claim, except that no such consent
shall be required if, following a written request from the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnitor shall fail, within 14 days after the making of such request,
to acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such Third Person Claim shall be
adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder to such Indemnified Party.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay, settle or compromise any such Third Person Claim without such consent, 
_provided_ , that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld.

 

(b) If any Third Person Claim against any Indemnified Party is solely for
money damages (and the potential liability of the Indemnitor exceeds the
potential liability of the Indemnified Party thereunder, as reasonably
determined by the Indemnified Party), or, where Seller is the Indemnitor, will
have no continuing effect in any material respect on the Business or the
Purchased Assets, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and
control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or
settlement of any such Third Person Claim against such Indemnified Party as to
which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party from any
Indemnitor hereunder if the Indemnitor has acknowledged and agreed in writing
that, if the same is adversely determined, the Indemnitor has an obligation to
provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, and in
any such case the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in connection therewith
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may
be reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith; _provided_
, that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and
at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to which
the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay, settle or compromise any such Third Person Claim, _provided_ , that in
such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
hereunder unless the Indemnified Party shall have sought the consent of the
Indemnitor to such payment, settlement or compromise and such consent was
unreasonably withheld or delayed, in which event no claim for indemnity
therefor hereunder shall be waived. The Indemnitor may not settle, adjust or
compromise any Third Person Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 



56 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of any Third
Person Claim arising out of or relating to the matters set forth in _Section_
__ _ 11.1(a)(v)_, Seller shall have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any such
Third Person Claim, and the applicable Buyer Group Members shall cooperate in
connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals as may be reasonably requested by Seller in connection therewith;
_provided_ , that (i) if the Losses and Expenses associated with such Third
Person Claims are reasonably likely to exceed $5 million in the aggregate or
(ii) if any Third Person Claim arising out of or relating to the matter set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(v)_ have not been finally resolved in
accordance with this Article XI on or prior the six-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, then Buyer shall have the right to conduct and control,
through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Third Person Claim (but, in the case of the foregoing _clause (ii)_ only with
respect to such matter), and Seller shall cooperate in connection therewith
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection therewith. Whether Seller or
Buyer has the right to conduct and control the defense, compromise or
settlement of any such Third Person Claim arising out of or relating to the
matters set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)(v)_ (as applicable, the "
_Controlling Party_ "), (i) the other party may participate, through counsel
chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person
Claim, and (ii) the Controlling Party shall not, without the written consent
of the other party (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
pay, compromise or settle any such Third Person Claim.

 

11.5. _Exclusive Remedies_. Except in the case of fraud and except for
injunctive and provisional relief (including specific performance), if the
Closing occurs, this _Article XI_ shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches
of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement).

11.6. _Other Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided for under
this Agreement shall be reduced by (i) any amounts actually realized by the
Indemnified Party as a result of any indemnification, contribution or other
payment by any third party and (ii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually realized by the Indemnified Party from third parties with respect to
such Losses, in each case, net of the expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in procuring such recovery (including, in the case of insurance
proceeds, any deductible or self-insured retention amount and any prospective
or retrospective premium adjustments).

(b) The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable actions to mitigate all
Losses to the extent required by Requirements of Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnitor shall have
any liability for any punitive damages, except to the extent such damages are
payable to a third party in respect of a Third Person Claim.

11.7. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The parties agree that any payment made
by an Indemnitor to an Indemnified Party under this _Article 11_ shall
constitute a dollar-for-dollar increase or decrease, as applicable, of the
Purchase Price.

59 13.5. _Successors and Assigns_.

 

(a) The rights of either party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by
such party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the
other, except that the rights of Buyer hereunder may be assigned in whole or
part prior to the Closing, without the consent of Seller, to any corporation,
limited liability company or other entity all of the outstanding
equity interests of which are, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by
Buyer; _provided_ that Buyer shall not be released from any of its obligations
hereunder by reason of such assignment. Following the Closing, either party
may assign any of its rights hereunder, but no such assignment shall relieve
it of its obligations hereunder.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. The successors and
permitted assigns hereunder shall include, in the case of Buyer, any permitted
assignee as well as the successors in interest to such permitted assignee
(whether by merger, liquidation (including successive mergers or liquidations)
or otherwise). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and
successors and assigns permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 13.5_ any right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

13.6. _Access to Records after Closing_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of Seller with respect to the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by Seller in connection
with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Business prior
to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Seller shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 13.6_. If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer shall,
prior to such disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Seller may select.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business which Seller or any of its Affiliates may retain
after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Seller and its
Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses
incurred by it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.6_. If Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior
to the expiration of such six-year period, Seller shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select.

13.7. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each
of the parties hereto.

 



60 13.8. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or
any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

13.9. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or
the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled
to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently
authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it
is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of
any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.

 

13.10. _Expenses_. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident
to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance
and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part
to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants.

 

13.11. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall
become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to each of Seller and Buyer. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic means
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

 

13.12. _Enforcement of Agreement_. In the event of an action at law or in
equity between the parties hereto to enforce any of the provisions hereof,
the unsuccessful party to such litigation or proceeding shall pay to the
successful party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred therein by such successful party on trial and appeal as adjudged by
the court, and if such successful party or parties shall recover judgment in
any such action or proceeding, such costs, expenses and attorneys fees may be
included as part of such judgment.

 

13.13. _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing, Seller
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer
such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and
transfer to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any part of
the Purchased Assets, and, in the case of licenses, certificates, approvals,
authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments
included in the Purchased Assets

 



61 (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of
third parties which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, to
cooperate with Buyer at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consent
promptly, and if any such consent is unobtainable, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other
manner, or

(b) which are otherwise not transferable or assignable, to use its
commercially reasonable efforts jointly with Buyer to secure to Buyer the
benefits thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the rights of
Seller thereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
Seller of its obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any license, certificate, approval,
authorization, agreement, contract, lease, easement or other commitment
included in the Purchased Assets if an attempted assignment thereof without
the consent of a third party thereto would constitute a breach thereof.

 

13.14. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of Delaware.

13.15. _Time is of the Essence_. With respect to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

13.16. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Seller and Buyer hereby irrevocably
submit in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to the
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any Delaware state court or federal court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware) and waive any and all objections to
jurisdiction that they may have under the laws of the State of Delaware or the
United States.
