Revenue Report is expressly waived. Parent shall make the Net Revenue
Payment, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.8.1_.

 

(iii) Within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Parent of Equityholders
Representatives Net Revenue Response, if any, the Equityholders
Representative and Parent shall endeavor in good faith to agree on any matters
in dispute.

 

(iv) If Parent and the Equityholders Representative are unable to agree on
any remaining matters in dispute within the thirty (30) day period set forth
in _Section 2.8.3(iii)_, then, notwithstanding _Section 9.10_ of this
Agreement, the matters in dispute will be submitted for resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which shall within thirty (30) days of such
submission determine and issue a written report to the Equityholders
Representative and Parent upon such disputed items (in no event enlarging upon
any such disputed item and in no event adding any new or additional item to
those set forth in Equityholders Representatives Net Revenue Response), and
such written report shall automatically and irrevocably be deemed the Final
Net Revenue Report and shall have full weight and accord of a  _res judicata_
decision (final judgment without any possible way of recourse or appeal).
Parent shall provide the Independent Accounting Firm (solely, without any
permitted disclosure to the Equityholders Representative and/or any
other party) with access to all information and materials reasonably
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to evaluate the calculations in
the Draft Net Revenue Report. Any objection to a Draft Net Revenue Report that
could have been, but was not, raised as an objection prior to such Draft Net
Revenue Report becoming a Final Net Revenue Report is expressly waived. All
upfront fees and expenses and other fees and expenses incurred prior to the
final and binding decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Equityholders Representative, on behalf of the
Equityholders. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be borne by the Equityholders Representative, on behalf of the
Equityholders, and Parent and shall be borne and paid equally as incurred;
_provided, however_ , that the ultimate responsibility of all such fees and
expenses (including all upfront fees and other fees and expenses) shall be in
inverse proportion to their respective success on the merits. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall calculate the allocation of fees and expenses and such
calculation shall be final and binding on the parties and provide
reimbursement for any fees and expenses previously paid by the parties in
accordance with



 

*** Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for
Confidential Treatment filed separately with the Commission.

 



15  such calculation (and in the case of Parent seeking reimbursement, shall
have the right to offset against the Indemnity Escrow or any payment of the
Net Revenue Earnout Payment).

 

(v) The Draft Net Revenue Report, as adjusted based on the final resolution of
each item set forth in the Equityholders Representatives Net Revenue
Response, in accordance with this _Section 2.8.3(v)_ if any, is referred to
as the " _Final Net Revenue Report_." The Final Net Revenue Report shall have
the legal effect of an arbitral award and shall be final, binding, and
conclusive on the parties hereto and shall automatically and irrevocably be
deemed the Final Net Revenue Report in accordance with this _Section 2.8.3_
and shall have full weight and accord of a _res judicata_ decision (final
judgment without any possible way of recourse or appeal). Any objection to a
Draft Net Revenue Report that could have been, but was not, raised as an
objection prior to such Draft Net Revenue Report becoming a Final Net Revenue
Report is expressly waived. Equityholders Representative agrees to maintain
confidentiality of all information provided in the Draft Net Revenue Report
and Final Net Revenue report in accordance with _Section 5.4_ and the use of
information providing therein shall be limited to any dispute arising over the
Net Revenue Earnout.

Section 2.8.4  _Payment of Net Revenue Earnout Amount_. If the Net Revenue
Target is achieved, Parent shall deliver, subject to the terms set forth
herein, within ten (10) Business Days following the achievement of the Net
Revenue Target based upon the issuance of a Final Net Revenue Report cash (a)
to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Equityholders, other than the
employee holders of Company Options, an amount of the Net Revenue Earnout
Amount sufficient to pay each of such Equityholders their Percentage Share of
the Net Revenue Earnout Amount, and (b) to the Surviving Corporation or a
third party designated by Parent for distribution to the employee holders of
Company Options, an amount of the Net Revenue Earnout Amount sufficient to
pay each of such Equityholders their Percentage Share of the Net Revenue
Earnout Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
except for any fees or expenses set forth in _Section 2.8.3(iv)_,
the maximum amount that can be awarded for any breach of this Agreement by
Parent arising from or relating to the Net Revenue Earnout is that amount that
would have been paid by Parent had such Net Revenue Target been satisfied and,
in no event, shall Parent be required to pay more than the Net Revenue
Earnout Amount.

Section 2.8.5 _Operation of the Business_. Until the expiration of the Net
Revenue Earnout Period, Parent and its affiliates shall act in good faith with
respect to selling the Company Earnout Products and agrees to use such
commercially reasonable efforts that may be necessary to promote and sell the
Company Earnout Products in the ordinary course of business. Parent further
agrees not to take, or to allow the Surviving Corporation to take, any action
in bad faith that would reasonably be expected to undermine the achievement of
the Net Revenue Target; _provided, however_ , that the Company and the
Equityholders Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, acknowledge,
understand and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
after the Closing, Parent shall exercise operational control of the business
and operations of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with its own
business judgment in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

Section 2.8.6 _Technical Failure_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, upon the occurrence of a Technical Failure with
respect to any of the Company Earnout Products, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, may, at its sole discretion, withdraw the Company
Earnout Products related to the Technical Failure from the market in order to
resolve such Technical Failure as soon as practicable

 



16  using commercially reasonable efforts. The parties also acknowledge and
agree that if, after Parents or the Surviving Corporations determination
that a Technical Failure has occurred with respect to any of the Company
Earnout Products, the Net Revenue Target is nevertheless achieved, the
Equityholders shall be entitled to the Net Revenue Earnout Amount at the time
and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, as
applicable, the Equityholders Representative with written notice, including
reasonable details supporting such determination as Parent determines
to provide in its sole discretion, within fifteen (15) days of any
determination by Parent or the Surviving Corporation that any Technical
Failure has occurred with respect to any of the Company Earnout Products. The
Equityholders Representative agrees to maintain confidentiality of all such
information in accordance with _Section 5.4_.

 

Section 2.8.7 _Parent Change of Control or Carve-Out Transaction_. In the
event that Parent desires to consummate a Parent Change of Control or Carve-
Out Transaction after the Effective Time before the Net Revenue Earnout Amount
has been paid, but remains eligible to be paid, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable depending upon the structure of the Parent Change
of Control or Carve-Out Transaction, shall ensure that either (a) Parent
remains liable to the obligations set forth under this _Section 2.8_ or (b)
the person acquiring Parent (or acquiring substantially all of its assets)
with respect to a Parent Change of Control or the person acquiring the Company
Products with respect to a Carve-Out Transaction (in either case, the "
_Acquiror_ ") assumes Parents or the Surviving Corporations (as applicable
depending upon the structure of the Parent Change of Control or Carve-Out
Transaction) obligations under this Agreement that are set forth in this
_Section 2.8_ (the " _Section 2.8 Obligations_ "), subject to all the
limitations and qualifications contained in _Section 2.8_, in which case the
parties acknowledge and agree that, following any such assumption (unless
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, is merged with the
Acquiror and is the surviving entity of such merger or becomes a subsidiary
of the Acquiror), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have no further
liability or obligation, whether primarily or secondarily, with respect to the
obligations set forth under this _Section 2.8_. For purposes of
clarification, (i) no consent of the Equityholders or Equityholders
Representative shall be required in connection with any Parent Change of
Control or Carve-out Transaction and (ii) no Net Revenue Earnout Payment
shall be payable solely based upon any Parent Change of Control or Carve-out
Transaction unless Parent does not comply with the terms of this _Section
2.8.7_.

 

Section 2.8.8 _Quarterly Net Revenue Reports_. During the Net Revenue Earnout
Period, Parent shall deliver to Equityholders Representatives within forty-
five (45) days after the end of each fiscal quarter, an interim, non-binding
draft quarterly Net Revenue report setting forth Parents reasonable estimate
of the Net Revenue for such immediately prior quarter (the " _Non-Binding
Quarterly Net Revenue Estimate_ "). The Non-Binding Quarterly Net Revenue
Estimate shall be provided solely for the purpose of providing an estimate of
the Net Revenue and shall be non-binding in nature. Each of the parties
acknowledge that any payment of the Net Revenue Earnout Amount shall be based
on the Final Net Revenue Report provided in accordance with _Section 2.8.3_.
The Equityholders Representative agrees to maintain confidentiality of all
such information in accordance with _Section 5.4_.

Section 2.8.9  _Assignment of Contingent Consideration Right_. The right of
each Equityholder to receive any Net Revenue Earnout Payment based on its
Percentage

 



17  Share shall not be evidenced by any form of certificate or instrument, and
does not represent any ownership or equity interest in the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates and does not
entitle any Equityholder to voting rights or rights to dividend payments. The
right of each of the Equityholders to receive any Net Revenue Earnout Payment
based on its Percentage Share shall not be assignable or transferable except
by (i) will, (ii) the Laws of intestacy, (iii) other operation of Law or (iv)
if such Equityholder is a partnership or a limited liability company, pursuant
to a Permitted Disposition (as defined below) to one or more partners or
members of such Equityholder or to one or more affiliates of such
Equityholder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, written notice of
such assignment and transfer shall be promptly delivered to each of Parent and
the Equityholders Representative by the transferor or assignor (or such
transferors or assignors estate), which notice shall expressly set forth the
transferor or assignor and the transferee or assignee, the rights to which
such transfer or assignment related and the effective date of such transfer;
and, _provided_ , _further_ , that as a condition to such transfer or
assignment, the parties to such transfer or assignment shall agree to provide
to each of Parent and the Equityholders Representative, at their respective
request, any additional evidence of the transfer or assignment that Parent or
the Equityholders Representative, as the case may be, may reasonably request.
None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Equityholders
Representative shall give effect to any purported assignment or transfer made
in contravention of this _Section 2.8.9_. A " _Permitted Disposition_ " means
a transfer or assignment to a third party approved in writing in advance by
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything set forth in this
Agreement, Parent shall have no obligation to approve any such transfer or
assignment if such transfer or assignment cannot, individually or taken
together with any prior transfer or assignment and any potential future
transfers or assignments and other facts and circumstances, be accomplished
in a transaction that is exempt from registration and qualification under U.S.
federal and state securities laws

 

Section 2.9 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Common Stock, Preferred Stock,
Company Warrants, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Notes for twelve
(12) months after the date such amounts were deposited into the Exchange Fund
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Common Stock,
Preferred Stock, Company Warrants, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company
Notes who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and similar Laws) as general creditors thereof for payment
of the applicable Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

 

Section 2.10 _No Liability_. Neither Parent, the Equityholders
Representative, the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Warrants,
Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Notes for any amounts, including any
cash from the Exchange Fund, lawfully delivered to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.11 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without interest thereon.

 



18 Section 2.12 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder (a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who shall not have voted or executed a written
consent to adopt this Agreement and has the right to demand and has properly
demanded an appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL or other applicable Law (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be due such Dissenting
Shareholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law unless
such Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such Dissenting Shareholders right to such payment or appraisal under the
DGCL or other applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to
appraisal, each such share of such Dissenting Shareholder shall no longer be
considered a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.1_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or other applicable Law
received by the Company. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger
Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution
of the claims of such holders, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing except to the extent required
by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a distribution
of any Additional Merger Consideration or any Net Revenue Earnout Amount, any
amount otherwise payable with respect to a Dissenting Share shall instead be
paid to Parent.

 

Section 2.13 _Withholding_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent, any third party
designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and Company RSUs, as
applicable, and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
applicable Law relating to Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except for
deductions or withholdings with respect to Company Options and Company
RSUs, as applicable, and provided that completed Forms W-8 and/or W-9 have
been delivered to the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for
making such payment, (a) before making any such deduction or withholding, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall give
the Equityholders Representative notice of the intention to make such
deduction or withholding (such notice, which shall include the authority,
basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding,
shall be given at least a commercially reasonable period of time before such
deduction or withholding is required, in order for the Equityholders
Representative to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding); and (b) the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall cooperate with the Equityholders Representative to the
extent reasonable in efforts to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. The Surviving Corporation, Parent, any third party
designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and Company RSUs, as
applicable, or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall timely remit to the

 



19  appropriate Governmental Entity any and all amounts so deducted or withheld.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, any
third party designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and Company
RSUs, as applicable, or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.14 _Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock, warrant and
option transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company
Warrants, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Notes that were
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates, Company Warrants, Company Options, Company RSUs
or Company Notes immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company
Warrants, Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Notes, except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, _Section 3.14.1(ii)_ of the

of the Company as it is currently conducted and currently proposed to be
conducted (provided the foregoing is not to be interpreted as a representation
of non-infringement).

(except for those office actions issued in the ordinary course of

Schedule, no other person (a) has any ownership interest in Company Owned IP,
including joint ownership interest, (b) has been granted any exclusive rights
in Company Owned IP or has been granted a sublicense to any Company Licensed
IP, or (c) has the right to file for registration of any Company-Owned IP or

the Company has ownership or license rights to improvements or derivative
works made by the Company in such Intellectual Property Rights or Technology.

Disclosure Schedule, the conduct of Companys business in the manner currently

owned or controlled by a third party. The Company has not received orally or
in writing from any person any notice, charge, claim or other assertion that
the Company is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, using without

provide or pay any other consideration to any person by reason of ownership,
use, exploitation, practice, sale or disposition of any Intellectual Property
Rights or Technology or making, using, selling, offering for sale,
distributing, licensing or importing any Company Product. Neither this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will directly or indirectly result in (a) the Company, including

32  restricted from transferring, assigning, enforcing, licensing, or using or
otherwise exploiting any Company IP Rights; (b) the Company providing,
granting or otherwise conveying, or being required to provide, grant or

applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate with, and do all
things reasonably requested to assist, one another: (a) in the prompt
preparation and filing (which filings shall occur no later than five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof) of any filings required for early
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act; (b) in determining
whether action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, proper or advisable or any actions, Consents or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any Listed Contract, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) in seeking to
obtain any such actions, Consents or waivers or to make any such filings in a
timely fashion, _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to make or
cause to be made any payment to any third party to secure any Consents under
any Listed Contract except with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company.
The Parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice,
and any other applicable Governmental Entity and shall respond promptly to
any such inquiry or request, including any request for supplemental
information in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR
Act or such other applicable Law. Each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act or any Consent required under such other applicable Law for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other
covenant herein contained, in connection with the receipt of any necessary
authorization, Consents, notifications or approvals under the HSR Act or
any other applicable Laws or otherwise, neither Parent nor its affiliates
shall be required to divest or hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits Parents or any of its affiliates freedom of
action with respect to, or their ability to retain, the Company or any
portions thereof or any of the businesses, product lines, properties of the
Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. In carrying out
their obligations under this  _Section 5.2_, each of the Parties shall keep
the other Parties fully informed of all communications with any Governmental
Entity and shall not submit or otherwise provide any information to such
Governmental Entity without first having provided a reasonable opportunity to
the other

 



51  Party and its counsel to comment upon such information and to participate in
any meetings, telephone calls or other communications with such Governmental
Entity.

 

Section 5.3 _Access_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
the Company shall, at the reasonable request of Parent, afford and facilitate
the opportunity for Parent to meet with key customers, distributors, sales
agents, suppliers, key opinion leaders or consultants of the Company;
provided, that, the Company shall be offered the opportunity to participate
in such meetings. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company shall afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of Parent full and complete access, at reasonable times
during normal business hours, to the personnel, premises, properties, books
and records, Contracts and all other documents and financing, operating and
other data of the Company that Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) any such access shall be conducted in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business conducted by
the Company; (b) any intrusive environmental tests or assessments sought to be
performed by or on behalf of the Purchaser Parties on any Company Real
Property (including, but not limited to any tests that involve drilling,
excavation, or the collection of samples of soils, groundwater, surface water,
drinking water, building materials or other environmental media) shall
require the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); (c) other than as set forth in
the first sentence of this _Section 5.3_, neither the Purchaser Parties nor
the Purchaser Parties Representatives shall contact or have any discussions
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any of
the landlords/sub-landlords, tenants/subtenants customers, distributors,
sales agents, suppliers, key opinion leaders or consultants of the Company;
_provided, however_ , if the Company fails to comply with the first sentence
of this Section 5.3, then Parent shall be entitled to directly contact such
persons as it determines in reasonable good faith; (d) Parent shall be
responsible for any damage to any Company Real Property or any other assets or
property of the Company caused by the Purchaser Parties or the Purchaser
Parties Representatives; and (e) the Company shall not be required to
confer, afford such access or furnish such copies or other information to the
extent that doing so would result in the breach of any confidentiality or
similar agreement to which the Company is a party or the loss of attorney-
client privilege; _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a
breach of such agreement or a loss of attorney-client privilege. From the
date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VII and the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of
the other party to report operational matters of materiality and the general
status of ongoing operations, subject to compliance with applicable Law. The
Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this  _Section
5.3_ that would unreasonably disrupt its normal operations. The
confidentiality of all such documents and information furnished in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge
that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, as
if such Confidentiality Agreement were entered into directly by each of the
parties hereto. The Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as
may be required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
securities exchange on which

 



52  the securities of a Party or an affiliate are listed, neither Party shall
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written approval of the other Party (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

Section 5.5.1 Subject to Section 5.5.4 and any other provision hereof, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Parent subsidiary to,
for the period immediately following the Effective Time through December 31,
2016 provide any employee of the Company employed as of the Closing (the "
_Company Employees_ ") with (i) base salary and annual target bonus
opportunities no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to the
Company Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing and that have been
disclosed to Parent, and (ii) employee benefits (including vacation and
leave, and employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
(including medical, dental, vision, accident, life, disability and other
employee welfare benefits)) which are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to
Closing and that have been disclosed to Parent (other than benefits pursuant
to any defined benefit pension plan and any plan providing for equity or
equity-based compensation).

Section 5.5.2 From and after the Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
its subsidiaries to provide, each Company Employee full credit for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual under
any employee benefits plan of Parent that is a defined benefit pension plan
and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or equity-related plans
or awards or other incentive awards granted after the Effective Time) under
any employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements and
employment-related entitlements provided, sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parents
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") for which Company
Employees may be otherwise eligible for such Company Employees service with
the Company, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized
by the Company prior to the Closing, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. To the
extent commercially reasonable, Parent shall (i) waive for each Company
Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment
requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation,
actively at work requirement or any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under the Parent Benefit Plans applicable to
such Company Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively at work requirement or other restriction would
not have been applicable to such Company Employee under the terms of the
Company Benefit Plans of the Company, (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the
extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing, and (iii) give full credit under the Parent Benefit Plans applicable
to each Company Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the
Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

 

Section 5.5.3 Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, the Company
Board will authorize the termination of any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
date the Company becomes a member of the same "Controlled Group of
Corporations" (as defined in Section 414(b) of the

 



53  Code) as Parent. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such
resolutions to terminate the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company have been adopted
by the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably
request. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make (or
cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions (i)
necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k)
plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) plan for
the period prior to termination; and (iii) for employer matching contributions
(if any) for the period prior to termination.

 

Section 5.5.4 The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are solely for the benefit
of the Parties, and no Company Employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or former employee or any participant or any beneficiary
thereof in any Company Benefit Plan or under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
regarded as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.5_, and no provision
of this _Section 5.5_ shall create such rights in any such persons. Nothing
herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the
ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii) require Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Benefit Plans or
other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) amend
any Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

 

Section 5.5.5 Prior to the Closing Date, but in no event later than five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to submit to a shareholder vote (in compliance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) the right of any
individual who is or could reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing
Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive payments and benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), in a manner reasonably
designed to cause the payments and benefits that would otherwise constitute a
"parachute payment" to be exempt from the definition of "parachute payment" by
reason of the exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
including requirements that such disqualified individual waive in advance the
right to any such payment or benefit if the requisite shareholder approval is
not obtained.

 

Section 5.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

Section 5.6.1 From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors (or persons serving or who served similar functions),
officers, employees and agents of the Company, or any person serving as a
fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, " _Covered Persons_ "),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law from and against any costs
or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to (a) the fact that the Covered Person is or was a trustee, director,
officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or fiduciary under or with respect
to any employee benefit plan, any act or omission taken by the Covered Person
in such capacity, or 

 



54  the fact that the Covered Person is or was serving at the request of the
Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of
another person, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the
time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification is
available under this Agreement and (b) any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby. Each Covered Person shall also be entitled to
advancement of costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) as incurred in
the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with
respect to any matters subject to indemnification hereunder, provided, that
any person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by
the applicable Law, to repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification (it being
understood and agreed that the Surviving Corporation shall not require the
posting of any bond or any other security for such undertaking).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is made against any Covered Person with respect to matters subject to
indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.6_ shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

Section 5.6.2 From and after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently set forth in
the Surviving Corporation Certificate and the Surviving Corporation By-Laws.

 

Section 5.6.3 Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the insurance
coverage provided under the policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the Agreement Date (the " _Existing
Policies_ ") covering each person currently covered by the Existing Policies
for a period not to exceed six (6) years from the Closing Date. Complete and
accurate copies of the Existing Policies have been heretofore made available
to Parent. Parent shall be required to purchase on behalf of the Surviving
Company the maximum "run-off coverage" available under the Existing Policies;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for such "run-off" coverage in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Percent
(250%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such
amount. If such maximum "run-off" coverage does not extend fully to the
required six (6) year period, Parent shall first seek the requisite coverage
from the Companys insurers under the Existing Policies prior to seeking such
requisite coverage from any other insurers. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentences shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail"
policies have been obtained by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of this _Section 5.6.3_, which policies provide coverage that
is consistent with the coverage required by the first sentence of this
_Section 5.6.3_ for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to
claims arising from events occurring on or before the Effective Time. The
premiums for such prepaid policies shall be paid in full at or prior to the
Effective Time and such prepaid policies shall be non-cancelable and existing
DandO Insurance of the Company may be cancelled as of the Closing and the
unused premium applied to the premium for such "tail" policy. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations

 



55  thereunder. The cost of the prepaid or annual premiums for any such
insurance policy acquired in connection with this _Section 5.6.2_ shall be
borne by the Company as a Transaction Expense and listed in the Transaction
Expenses Statement delivered by the Company in connection with the Closing.

 

Section 5.6.4 In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_.

 

Section 5.6.5 The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are (a) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each person released or entitled
to indemnification, or other benefit hereunder, and each such persons heirs,
representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_, and (b) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.
Neither the Purchaser Parties, on the one hand, nor the Company and the
Equityholders Representative, on the other hand, shall (i) amend the
provisions of this _Section 5.6_ in a manner that would adversely affect any
such third party beneficiary without the prior written consent of such third
party beneficiary or (ii) following the Closing, enter into, or permit any of
its affiliates to enter into, any merger, consolidation or other transaction
unless the Purchaser Parties shall have ensured that the surviving
or resulting entity is creditworthy and will assume the obligations imposed
by this _Section 5.6_. With respect to any claim by a third party beneficiary
under this _Section 5.6_, no Releasing Party may assert by way of
defense, set-off, or counterclaim, any claim against, or Losses owing by, the
Equityholders or another third party beneficiary.

 

Section 5.7 _Notice of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof through the
Closing, each Party, upon obtaining knowledge of such matter, shall give
notice to the other Parties of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event which occurrence or failure would be likely to cause any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in a
manner reasonably likely to result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VI_ , (c) receipt of any notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default, or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
become a default, under any Material Contract, (d) receipt of any written
notice or other communication in writing from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (e) receipt of any written
notice or other communication in writing from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (f) the
commencement or threat of any lawsuit involving or affecting the Company or
any of its properties or assets, and (g) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any fact or event that causes or is reasonably likely to cause a breach by
a Party of any provision of this Agreement applicable to it. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no notice under this _Section 5.7_ shall be deemed to have
modified (a) any representation and/or warranty or cured any breach of
covenant for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ , or (b) a Partys right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_ or (c) any Indemnitees rights to be indemnified or
any Indemnitors obligation to indemnify under _Article VIII_.

 



56 Section 5.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

Section 5.8.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

 _Section 5.8.1.1 Pre-Closing Tax Returns Filed After the Closing_. With
respect to all Tax Returns of the Company for all taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing,
(i) if such Tax Returns are non-income Tax Returns, Parent shall engage, at
its expense, the accounting firm(s) historically engaged by the Company for
such Tax Return preparation purposes to prepare such non-income Tax Returns,
(ii) if such Tax Returns are income Tax Returns, Parent may elect to either
(A) engage, at its expense, the accounting firm historically engaged by the
Company for such Tax Return preparation purposes to prepare such income Tax
Returns, or (B) prepare such income Tax Returns internally, and (iii) all such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of
the Company (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). Parent shall (i)
deliver to the Equityholders Representative a copy of all such Tax Returns at
least thirty (30) days (in the case of income Tax Returns) or fifteen (15)
days (in the case of non-income Tax Returns) before the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (or, if required to be filed within such number of days after
the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the Closing Date), (ii)
provide the Equityholders Representative reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Tax Returns, and (iii) consider any such comments in good
faith; provided, however, that Parent shall incorporate (or cause to
be incorporated) such comments to the extent (i) they are reasonably
requested by the Equityholders Representative, and (ii) they relate to any
item on any such Tax Return in respect of which the Equityholders may be
obligated to make payment pursuant to the following sentence. Parent shall
file (or cause to be filed) the Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section
5.8.1.1_, and the Equityholders shall pay to Parent the Taxes shown as due on
such Tax Returns at least three (3) days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes were included in Closing
Working Capital or Transaction Expenses and taken into account in the
Adjustment Amount.

 

 _Section 5.8.1.2 Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns of the
Company that relate to any taxable year or period beginning before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Parent shall
(i) deliver to the Equityholders Representative a copy of all such Tax
Returns at least thirty (30) days (in the case of income Tax Returns) or
fifteen (15) days (in the case of non-income Tax Returns) before the due date
for filing such Tax Returns (or, if required to be filed within such number
of days after the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the Closing
Date), (ii) provide the Equityholders Representative reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Tax Returns, and (iii) consider any such
comments in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall incorporate
(or cause to be incorporated) such comments to the extent (i) they are
reasonably requested by the Equityholders Representative, and (ii) they
relate to any item on any such Tax Return in respect of which the
Equityholders may be obligated to make payment pursuant to the following
sentence. The Equityholders shall pay to Parent the amount of Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Return to the extent attributable to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined in accordance with
Section 5.8.2) at least three (3) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes were included in Closing Working
Capital or Transaction Expenses and taken into account in the Adjustment
Amount.

 



57 _Section 5.8.1.3 _Amending Tax Returns. Except as required by applicable Law
or in connection with a Tax Contest resolved pursuant to Section 5.8.4, Parent
shall not file any amended Tax Return of the Company for any period or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date except in accordance with this
Section 5.8.1.3. Parent shall (i) deliver to the Equityholders Representative
a copy of all such amended Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days (in the case
of income Tax Returns) or fifteen (15) days (in the case of non-income Tax
Returns) before filing such Tax Returns, (ii) provide the Equityholders
Representative reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Tax
Returns, and (iii) consider any such comments in good faith. Parent shall not
file such amended Tax Returns without the prior written consent of the
Equityholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent such amendment could
reasonably be expected to result in any increase in Tax liabilities for any
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date
(including as a result of any net decrease in aggregate Tax carryforwards
(combined tax credits and net operating losses) attributable to any taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date).

Section 5.8.2  _Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes_. In order to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to Straddle Periods, the Parties
shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant
Governmental Entity to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
year or period of the Company, and such portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be treated as a short taxable year. In any case
where applicable Law does not permit the Company to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company with respect to a
Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of Taxes that are
based upon or measured by income, receipts or payroll, be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date
and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days from the beginning of such Straddle Period through and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

Section 5.8.3 _Cooperation_. Parent, the Company and the Equityholders
Representative shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

Section 5.8.4 _Contest Provisions_. If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent or
the Company receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return
of the Company for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice,
Parent shall notify the Equityholders Representative of such notice. Parent
shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest,
_provided, however_ , that, to the extent such Tax Contest (i) could give rise
to Taxes for which Parent is entitled to indemnification under _Article
VIII_ (taking into account the limitations set forth therein), and (ii) such
Tax Contest relates solely

 



58  to one or more taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the
Equityholders Representative may elect to control the conduct and resolution
of such Tax Contest and if such election is made, the Equityholders
Representative shall keep Parent reasonably fully and timely informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not effect any such settlement or
compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining the Parents prior written
consent thereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided, further_ , that, to the extent (i) (A) such Tax Contest
could give rise to Taxes for which Parent is entitled to indemnification
under Article VIII (taking into account the limitations set forth therein),
and (B) such Tax Contest does not relate solely to one or more taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) the Equityholders
Representative declines to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax
Contest described in the preceding proviso, Parent shall have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, shall keep
the Equityholders Representative reasonably fully and timely informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest to the extent relating to any Tax period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and shall not effect any
such settlement or compromise of such Tax Contest to the extent relating to
any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date without
obtaining the Equityholders Representatives prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure by Parent to provide notice of a
Tax Contest shall not affect Parents right to indemnification pursuant to
_Article VIII,_ except to the extent the Equityholders Representative or the
Equityholders were actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

Section 5.8.5 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, all Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or Tax allocation agreements or
other similar arrangements (excluding customary Tax indemnification provisions
in commercial Contracts not primarily relating to Taxes) with respect to or
involving the Company (other than this Agreement) shall cease and be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

Section 5.8.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than such Taxes referred to in the
third-to-last sentence of _Section 2.2.3.1_ (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the
Equityholders, provided that the Equityholders obligation to bear such share
of any Transfer Taxes shall be deemed satisfied to the extent such amount was
included in Closing Working Capital or Transaction Expenses and taken into
account in the Adjustment Amount. The party required by applicable Law shall
file in a timely manner all necessary documents (including, but not limited
to, all Tax Returns) with respect to Transfer Taxes. The expense of such
filings shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by
the Equityholders.

 

Section 5.8.7 _Overlap Provisions_. In the event of any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this  _Section 5.8_ and _Article VIII_, the
provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall control.

 

Section 5.9 _No Solicitations_.

 

Section 5.9.1 The Company will not, and will not permit any of its directors,
officers, employees, advisors, representatives or agents, to, directly or
indirectly,

 



59  (i) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose,
participate in or enter into, either as the proposed surviving, merged,
acquiring or acquired corporation, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any amount of
the assets of the Company (other than any disposition of assets in the

the aggregate cost of pursuing any related insurance claims or otherwise
required to restore such Parent Indemnitee to the same economic position as
would have existed had such insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements been collected prior to the
settlement of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Parent
Indemnitee shall have any obligation to seek to recover any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements
in connection with making a claim under this _Article VIII_. The calculation
of Damages shall not include losses arising because of a change after Closing
in Law or accounting principle. To the extent that a claim
for indemnification by a Parent Indemnitee hereunder relates to a Liability
incurred by the Company and there is an accrual on the Interim Balance Sheet
in respect of such Liability, then the determination of Damages in respect of
such claim shall be net of such accrual.

Section 8.3.4 Nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall limit any remedy Parent or
any of the Equityholders may have against any person for actual fraud
involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement made with the intent of
inducing any other party hereto to enter into this Agreement and upon which
such other party has relied (as opposed to any fraud claim based on
constructive knowledge, negligent misrepresentation or a similar theory) under
applicable tort laws.

 

Section 8.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 

Section 8.4.1 Upon receipt by any Parent Indemnitee seeking to be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ of notice of any actual or possible claim, demand,
suit,

 



69  inquiry or Action that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third
party against the Parent Indemnitee (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Parent
Indemnitee shall promptly give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the
Equityholders Representative (the " _Indemnitor_ ") indicating the nature of
such Third-Party Claim and the stated basis therefor and the amount of Damages
claimed pursuant to such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known; _provided,
however_ , that a delay in notifying the Indemnitor shall not result in any
Parent Indemnitee losing its rights to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ except to the extent the Indemnitor demonstrates that the
defense of such Third-Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby.

 

Section 8.4.2 If (i) the Indemnitor, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article VIII_ , has conceded liability to indemnify the Parent
Indemnitee with respect to all Damages relating to such Third-Party Claim and
(ii) a reasonable assessment of the likely maximum amount of such Damages is
less than or equal to the amount then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund
and not otherwise subject to a claim for indemnification under this _Article
VIII_ , then, subject to Section 8.4.3, the Indemnitor shall have thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Parent Indemnitees notice of a given Third-Party
Claim to elect, at its option and its expense, to appoint counsel of the
Indemnitors choice to represent the Parent Indemnitee in connection with such
Third-Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Parent Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor so elects to assume the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim: (i) the attorneys fees, other
professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs incurred by
the Indemnitor in connection with defending such Third-Party Claim, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 8.3_, shall be payable first from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, next, to the extent arising from a breach of
any Fundamental Representations or the Trademark Fundamental Representations,
against any offset against future amounts that would otherwise be payable to
Equityholders out of the Net Revenue Earnout Amount based on the Percentage
Share and then by such additional amounts from all Indemnitors based on the
Percentage Share; (ii) the Parent Indemnitee shall not be entitled to be
indemnified for any costs or expenses incurred by the Parent Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (iii) the Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such defense
at its sole expense; (iv) the Parent Indemnitee shall make available to the
Indemnitor all books, records and other documents and materials that are
under the direct or indirect control of the Parent Indemnitee and that the
Indemnitor may reasonably request in connection with the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; (v) the Parent Indemnitee shall execute such documents and
take such other actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably request for the
purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or
adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vi) the Parent Indemnitee
shall otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vii) the Parent Indemnitee shall not
admit any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (viii) the
Indemnitor shall not enter into any agreement providing for the settlement or
compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment
with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Parent Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 8.4.3 If (i) the Indemnitor has not conceded liability to indemnify
the Parent Indemnitee with respect to all Damages relating to such Third-Party
Claim in accordance with _Section 8.4.2_, (ii) a reasonable assessment of the
likely maximum amount of such Damages is greater than the amount then
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and not otherwise subject to a claim
for indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , (iii) the

 



70  Indemnitor elects not to defend such Third-Party Claim, (iv) the claim for
indemnification is with respect to a criminal claim, demand or Action against
the Parent Indemnitee (or could otherwise reasonably be expected to involve
or develop into a claim involving a criminal claim or criminal charges against
the Parent Indemnitee), (v) the Parent Indemnitee has been advised by counsel
that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Parent Indemnitee, (vi) the Indemnitor has failed or is
failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim or shall have
failed to have engaged counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Parent
Indemnitee, (vii) the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief against the Parent Indemnitee, (viii)
such Third-Party Claim seeks any license to any Intellectual Property
Rights, (ix) any claim related to a breach of the Trademark Fundamental
Representations or (x) the Third-Party Claim would materially interfere with
or materially and adversely affect the business, reputation, operations or
assets of the Parent Indemnitee or any of its affiliates, then the Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to the assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, _provided_ that the Parent Indemnitee shall have no right to seek
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ in respect of such Third-Party
Claim for any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such
Third-Party Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to
such Third-Party Claim entered into without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 8.5 _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, NO
PARTY NOR ANY EQUITYHOLDER OR EQUITYHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE, NOR ANY CURRENT
OR FORMER SHAREHOLDER, DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, AFFILIATE OR ADVISOR OF
ANY OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL, IN ANY EVENT, BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PERSON,
EITHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH HEREOF, WHETHER OR NOT THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER PARTY IN ADVANCE
OR COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN BY SUCH OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE AWARDED IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD PARTY CLAIM).

 

Section 8.6 _Information; Waiver_. The right to indemnification or any other
remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect
the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

 

Section 8.7 _Indemnification Claims; Escrow Arrangements_.

 

Section 8.7.1 No Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ unless the Parent Indemnitee has duly delivered a written
notice to the Indemnitor and the Escrow Agent (any such notice being referred
to as a " _Notice of Indemnification Claim_ ," and the claim for
indemnification described in such Notice of 

 



71  Indemnification Claim being referred to as an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
setting forth: (i) the specific representation and warranty of the Company or
the Purchaser Parties, as applicable, alleged to have been inaccurate or
specific covenant of the Company or the Purchaser Parties, as applicable,
alleged to have been breached or other specific circumstance entitling the
Parent Indemnitee to such indemnification; (ii) if known, a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged
inaccuracy in such representation and warranty or breach of such covenant or
other specific circumstance entitling the Parent Indemnitee to such
indemnification; and (iii) if known, the aggregate dollar amount of the
Damages that have been, or are reasonably expected to be, incurred and for
which the Parent Indemnitee is seeking indemnification hereunder (the
aggregate amount of such estimate being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_
").

Section 8.7.2 During the thirty (30) day period commencing upon the receipt
by the Indemnitor of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Indemnitor may
deliver to the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent a written response (the
" _Response Notice_ ") in which the Indemnitor: (i) agrees that the full
Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part (but
not all) of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee; or (iii)
asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Parent Indemnitee.
Any Response Notice contemplated by clause (ii) or (iii) shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the Indemnitors reasons for such
objection. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the
Indemnitor to be owed to the Parent Indemnitee shall be referred to as the "
_Contested Amount_."

 

Section 8.7.3 If the Indemnitor delivers a Response Notice to the Parent
Indemnitee agreeing that all or any part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Parent Indemnitee, then, within three (3) Business Days following the receipt
of such Response Notice by the Parent Indemnitee, the Parent Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release such amount agreed to
by the Indemnitor (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) to the Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If
the Indemnitor fails to deliver a Response Notice within thirty (30) days
after its receipt of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Parent Indemnitee the Claimed Amount.

 

Section 8.7.4 If the Indemnitor and the Parent Indemnitee are unable to
resolve any dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the thirty (30)
day period commencing upon the receipt of the Response Notice by Parent, then
such dispute will be resolved in accordance with _Section 9.10.3_ or
otherwise by written agreement between the Parent Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor. Following any such resolution, the Parent Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three
(3) Business Days after such resolution, a written notice instructing
the Escrow Agent to make payment, if any, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
consistent with such resolution.

Section 8.7.5 If the aggregate amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon, as of the
Expiration Date (the " _Aggregate Escrow Balance_ ") exceeds the aggregate
dollar amount, as of the Expiration Date, of the Contested Amounts associated
with all Indemnification Claims that have not been finally resolved and paid
prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this _Section 8.5_ (each, an
" _Unresolved Escrow Claim_ ," and the aggregate dollar amount of such
Contested Amounts as of the Expiration Date being referred to as the "
_Aggregate Pending Claim Amount_ "), then the Parent Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor shall jointly execute and 

 



72  deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to
release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to (i) each holder of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock, Company Warrants or Company Notes, the amount
determined by multiplying such Equityholders Percentage Share for shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock, Company Warrants or Company Notes by the
Aggregate Distribution Amount and (ii) the Surviving Corporation or a third
party designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and Company RSUs,
as applicable, the amount determined by multiplying the Percentage Share for
Company Options for all holders of Company Options or Company RSUs for all
holders of Company RSUs, as applicable, by the Aggregate Distribution Amount.
Within five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any amounts specified
in the preceding sentence by the Surviving Corporation or such third party
designated by Parent, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation through its
payroll or such third party to promptly pay to each holder of Company Options
and Company RSUs, as applicable, an amount equal to such holders share of
the amounts specified in the preceding sentence, in accordance with such
holders Percentage Share for such Company Options and Company RSUs, as
applicable, less applicable withholding as set forth in _Section 2.12_. For
purposes of this  _Section 8.5_, the " _Aggregate Distribution Amount_ "
shall be the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of the Expiration Date _minus_ the
Aggregate Pending Claim Amount.

 

Section 8.7.6 Following the Expiration Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is
finally resolved, the Parent Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days after
the final resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to make payments, if any, from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund consistent with such resolution. The payment of any amount
released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to (i) each holder of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock, Company Warrants or Company Notes shall be
determined by multiplying such Equityholders Percentage Share for shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock, Company Warrants or Company Notes by the
amount (if any) by which the aggregate amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned
thereon, as of the date of resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim exceeds
the aggregate amount of the Contested Amounts associated with all other
remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims and (ii) to (ii) the Surviving Corporation
or a third party designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and
Company RSUs, as applicable, the amount determined by multiplying the
Percentage Share for Company Options for all holders of Company Options and
Company RSUs for all holders of Company RSUs, as applicable, by the amount (if
any) by which the aggregate amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon, as of the
date of resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate
amount of the Contested Amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved
Escrow Claims. Within five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any
amounts specified in the preceding sentence by the Surviving Corporation or
such third party designated by Parent, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation through its payroll or such third party to promptly pay to each
holder of Company Options and Company RSUs, as applicable, an amount equal to
such holders share of the amounts specified in the preceding sentence, in
accordance with such holders Percentage Share for such Company Options and
Company RSUs, as applicable, less applicable withholding as set forth in
_Section 2.12_.

Section 8.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. The Parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



73 Article IX

 

General Provisions

 

Section 9.1 _Equityholders  Representative_.

 

Section 9.1.1 _Appointment_.

 

 _Section 9.1.1.1 _By voting or executing a written consent in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the
Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and
receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive the
consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each Equityholder shall
be deemed to have approved the designation of, and hereby designates, Fortis
Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (and by execution of this
Agreement it hereby accepts such appointment) as exclusive agent and attorney-
in-fact for and on behalf of the Equityholders (in their capacity as such),
with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each
Equityholder with respect to _Section 2.4_, _Section 2.9_, _Section 5.9_, 
_Section 5.11_, _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ of this Agreement and any
other provision in this Agreement related to the Equityholders. Following the
Effective Time, the Equityholders Representative may take any and
all actions and make any decisions that it believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf
of the Equityholders as if the Equityholders were acting on their own behalf,
including, giving and receiving any notice or instruction permitted or
required under this Agreement by the Equityholders Representative or any
Equityholder, interpreting all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
authorizing payments to be made with respect hereto, dealing with the
Purchaser Parties under this Agreement with respect to all matters arising
under this Agreement, taking any and all other actions specified in or
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and engaging counsel,
accountants or other agents in connection with the foregoing matters;
_provided that_ in no event shall the Equityholders Representative be able to
bind the Equityholders with respect to any amounts in excess of the
then remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and Indemnity
Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equityholders
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Equityholders,
except as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Equityholders
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
following the Effective Time, the Equityholders Representative shall have
full power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement on behalf of all of the Equityholders and to consent to any
amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of all of the Equityholders. Each
Equityholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence from the Equityholders
Representative, including in electronic form.

 

 _Section 9.1.1.2 _The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Equityholders Representative Group in this _Section 9.1:_
(i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, (ii) may be
delegated by the Equityholders Representative, (iii) shall survive the
delivery of an assignment by any Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of
his, her or its interest in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (iv) shall survive
the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation or incapacity of each
Equityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto. The
Equityholders Representative may resign at any time and such agency may be
changed by the holders of a majority in interest of, collectively, (i) the
shares of Common Stock, determined on a Fully-Diluted Basis and (ii) the
shares of Common Stock into which any and all shares of Preferred

 



74  Stock are convertible, from time to time (including in the event of the
death, disability or other incapacity of an Equityholders Representative that
is an individual and including, with respect to any Equityholders
Representative, in the event of the resignation of the Equityholders
Representative), and any such successor shall succeed the Equityholders
Representative as Equityholders Representative hereunder; _provided_ that
(i) such proposed successor first executes a confidentiality agreement in
substantially the same form as the Equityholders Representative
Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) Parent is provided with at least ten (10)
Business Days prior written notice of such upcoming change to the
Equityholders Representative. The immunities and rights to indemnification
set forth herein shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Equityholders Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the
Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. No
bond shall be required of the Equityholders Representative, and
the Equityholders Representative shall receive no compensation for its
services other than pursuant to the terms of the engagement agreement entered
into between Fortis Advisors LLC and certain of the Companys stockholders on
or about the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay any amount
to the Equityholders Representative in its capacity as such.

 

Section 9.1.2 _Limitation on Liability_. Certain Equityholders have entered
into an engagement agreement with the Equityholders Representative to
provide direction to the Equityholders Representative in connection with its
services under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Equityholders,
including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred
to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Equityholders Representative nor
its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees
nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Equityholders 
Representative Group_"), shall be liable for any act of the Equityholders
Representative arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or
under any Equityholders Representative engagement agreement (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith and reasonable
judgment), except to the extent any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine,
cost or expense is actually incurred by such person as a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Equityholders Representative.
The Equityholders Representative Group shall not be liable for, and shall be
indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Equityholders (on a several but
not joint basis pro rata in accordance with the Purchase Price received by
such Equityholder) for any liability, loss, claim, damage, penalty, fee,
cost, expenses (including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other
skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers)
judgment, amount paid in settlement or fine (collectively, the "
_Equityholders  Representative Losses_") incurred by the Equityholders
Representative (and any cost or expense incurred by the Equityholders
Representative in connection therewith) arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement or the Equityholder Representative engagement agreement and
the enforcement thereof, in each case as such Equityholders Representative
Loss is incurred; _provided_ that to the extent it is finally adjudicated that
any such Equityholders Representative Loss or any portion thereof was
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Equityholders Representative, the Equityholders Representative will
reimburse the Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Equityholders
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Such Equityholders Representative Expenses may be
recovered first, from the Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the
Indemnity

 



75  Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Equityholders at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Equityholders. The Equityholders
acknowledge that the Equityholders Representative shall not be required to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Equityholders Representative
shall not be required to take any action unless the Equityholders
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities
which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the Equityholders
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Equityholders Representative in performing such actions. The
costs of such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing
this right of indemnification) shall be the responsibility of the
Equityholders pro rata based on a pro rata basis, and the Purchaser Parties
shall have no liability therefor.

 

 _Section 9.1.2.1 _Upon the Closing, Parent from the Purchase Price otherwise
payable to the Equityholders, and on behalf of such Equityholders, shall wire
to the Equityholders Representative $350,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ ").
The Expense Fund Amount shall be held by the Equityholders Representative as
agent and for the benefit of the Sellers in a segregated client account and
shall be used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the
Equityholders Representative for any Equityholders Representative Expenses
incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or the
Equityholders Representative engagement agreement, or (ii) as otherwise
determined by the Advisory Group (the " _Expense Fund_ "). The Equityholders
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations
or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Equityholders Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder.
As soon as reasonably determined by the Equityholders Representative that
the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the Equityholders
Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund, if any, to (i) the
Paying Agent for distribution to each holder of Common Stock, Preferred
Stock, Company Warrants and Company Notes in accordance with such holders
Percentage Share and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation or a third party
designated by Parent to pay holders of Company Options and Company RSUs,
as applicable, in accordance with such holders Percentage Share.

Section 9.1.3 _Actions of the Equityholders  Representative_. From and after
the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders Representative shall constitute a decision of all Equityholders
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Equityholder and such
Equityholders successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by
such Equityholder, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deal exclusively with the Equityholders Representative on all matters set
forth in _Section 9.1.1.1_ without any independent investigation and
notwithstanding any knowledge of any dispute or disagreement about the
Equityholders and may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Equityholders Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each Equityholder. Parent and the Surviving Corporation are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Equityholders Representative. The
Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Closing
Equity Payment Allocation Schedule, (ii) rely upon any

 



76  signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Equityholder or other party. Further, all defenses which may be available to
any Equityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Equityholders Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement are waived.

 

Section 9.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
Party shall pay all of its own fees, costs and expenses (including fees,
costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other
representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

 

Section 9.3 _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or
permitted under, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person
or upon electronic confirmation of receipt when transmitted by email or
facsimile transmission or on the next Business Day if transmitted by national
overnight courier, in each case as follows; provided that with respect to
notices delivered to the Equityholders Representative, such notices must be
