THE GYMBOREE CORPORATION

Dated as of October 11, 2010

 

The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way
of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may
have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the
Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of, or other
investors in, the Company. The Companys stockholders and other investors are
not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely
on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof
as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the
Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates. TABLE OF CONTENTS

or otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify
or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to any
holder of Company Common Stock or (viii) provide any "subsequent offering
period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, (i) extend
the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five
(5) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree)
each, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been satisfied or
waived, until such time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or
waived; (ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer and (iii) if the Marketing Period has not ended on the
last Business Day prior to the expiration of the Offer, extend the Offer until
the earliest to occur of (x) any Business Day before or during the Marketing
Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days
prior notice to the Company, and (y) the first (1st) Business Day after the
final day of the Marketing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquisition
Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at
any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, each Offer



 

2  Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been
satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been
satisfied, then Acquisition Sub may and, if requested by the Company,
Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, extend the
Offer by increments of five (5) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the maximum number of days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this
sentence shall be twenty (20) Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Acquisition Sub may extend the Offer for up to ten (10)
Business Days from the day the Marketing Period will otherwise end and (ii) if
the Debt Financing has not funded at the expiration of the Offer, then the
Offer will be automatically extended to the later of (A) fifteen (15)
Business Days (or, if the extension in (i) has been exercised, no more than
twenty (20) Business Days in total for clause (i) and this clause (ii)) from
the date thereof, (B) December 31, 2010, or (C) such earlier date as Parent
may specify (the "Extension Period"). Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all
shares of Company Common Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer promptly after the expiration of the Offer.
Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer, which shall occur no earlier than
November 23, 2010, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing,"
and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date." The Offer may not be terminated prior
to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this  _Section 2.1(a)_), unless this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_. If (i) at any then-
scheduled expiration of the Offer, (x) each Offer Condition (other than the
Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived, (y) the
Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied and (z) no further
extensions or re-extensions of the Offer are permitted or required pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(a)_, (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ or (iii) at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, (x)
each Offer Condition shall have been satisfied or waived, (y) the proceeds of
the Debt Financing are not funded pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter and (z) no further extensions or re-extensions of the Offer
are permitted or required pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_, then, in each
case, Acquisition Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty four
(24) hours of such termination but prior to the Offer Closing), irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant
to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence is
referred to this Agreement as the "Offer Termination," and the date on which
the Offer Termination occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Termination Date." If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Acquisition
Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_,
Acquisition Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting
on behalf of Acquisition Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common
Stock to the registered holders thereof.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO
and the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments
or supplements thereto, the "Offer

 



 

3  Documents"). The Company shall furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all
information concerning the Company that is required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for
amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the
Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC), on the other hand. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Offer Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments
on such document or response.

 

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Acquisition Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

(d) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or Acquisition Sub are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Acquisition Sub.

 

Section 2.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On or promptly after the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Schedule 14D-9"), which shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
6.6_, describe and make the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer,
and shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock. To the extent requested
by the Company, Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or
otherwise disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock together with
the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock.

 



4  Parent and Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Acquisition Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for
amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and resolve any comments of the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) as promptly as reasonably practicable. Prior to the filing
of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response and shall in good faith consider
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Acquisition Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of a recent date, and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders,
security position listings, computer files and all other information in the
Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company
Common Stock, and shall furnish to Acquisition Sub such information (including
updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files)
as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall keep confidential and not
disclose the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and
files, in each case as required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the
Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or
control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable option (the
"Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this _Section 2.3_ following the Offer Closing, to purchase at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price that number of newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up



 

5  Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of
the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance
of the Top-Up Option Shares;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option
may not be exercised to the extent that the number of Top-Up Option Shares
exceeds that number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued
(treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not
reserved for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up
Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part. The
obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon
the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that no
applicable Law shall be in effect that has the effect of enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Option Shares complies with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act. If the Offer Conditions have been satisfied
or waived and there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to
the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its affiliates, would
represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding on the Offer Closing Date, Acquisition Sub shall be deemed to have
exercised the Top-Up Option on the Offer Closing Date and on such date shall
give the Company written notice specifying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its subsidiaries at
the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing). The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice on the
Offer Closing Date, deliver written notice to Acquisition Sub specifying,
based on the information provided by Acquisition Sub in its notice, the number
of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the location
specified in _Section 2.5_ on a date specified by Parent, the purchase price
owed by Acquisition Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company,
at Acquisition Subs option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds,
or (ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount
equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option
Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to
the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding
clause (x) (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall be due on
the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (ii) shall bear simple
interest of five percent (5%) per annum, (iii) shall be full recourse to
Parent and Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any
time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other material terms.
At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub
a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(c) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option



 

6  Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and
the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option
are being and will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as
a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.5_.

 

Section 2.4 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue under the name "The Gymboree Corporation" as the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

 

Section 2.5 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , the closing of the Merger (the
"Merger Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific time) on a date no
earlier than November 23, 2010 to be specified by Parent, but no later than
the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP; Four Embarcadero Center, Suite 3800; San Francisco, California 94111,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (such date being the "Merger Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, (i) if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of
the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger
Closing), then the Merger Closing shall occur instead on the date following
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of
(a) any Business Day before or during the Marketing Period as may be
specified by Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days prior notice to the
Company and (b) the Business Day immediately following the final Business Day
of the Marketing Period, which shall be deemed the Merger Closing Date and
(ii) the Merger Closing shall not occur prior to the end of the Extension
Period, if any.

Section 2.6  _Effective Time_.

(a) Simultaneously with the Merger Closing, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall cause a certificate of merger, or a certificate of
ownership and merger, as applicable (the "Certificate of Merger"), with
respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State as
provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and
time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary
of State or at such other date and time as is agreed between the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time").



 

7 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.7 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Subject to  _Section
6.7_, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to be identical to the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of Acquisition Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 

Section 2.8 _Board of Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, each of the
parties hereto shall take all necessary action to ensure that the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately
following, the Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of
directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.9 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock, held by a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub (including as a result of an
exercise of the Top-Up Option by Acquisition Sub), in each case, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). Each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of
Company Restricted Stock) to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided 



 

8  in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry
shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. Any shares
of Company Common Stock held by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall
remain outstanding and shall become that number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation as the number
of shares of Company Common Stock held by such subsidiary bore to the
aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
subject to _Section 6.1(c)_ and  _Section 6.1(j_), if at any time during
the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur
as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the "Paying Agent"),
the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3_. Simultaneously with the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the Total Common Merger Consideration, (ii)
the Total 1993/2002 Option Cash Payments _,_ (iii) the Total 2004 Option Cash
Payments, (iv) the Total Restricted Stock Unit Payments, and (v) the Total
Restricted Stock Payments (the "Aggregate Merger Consideration" and, such
Aggregate Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the
"Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make
the payments contemplated by  _Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3_, Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock and (ii) applied
promptly to making the payments pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_.



 

9 The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to  _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.3_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by
hand) (i) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Restricted Stock) (x) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be collected by hand by the
surrendering holder or by wire transfer to the surrendering holder), (ii) to
each holder of a Company Option, a check or direct deposit in an amount due
and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ in respect of such
Company Option, (iii) to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit, a
check or direct deposit in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant
to _Section 3.3(b)_ in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Unit and (iv)
to each holder of a share of Company Restricted Stock, a check or direct
deposit in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_ in respect of such share of Company Restricted Stock.

 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Restricted Stock)
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed,
made available for collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer, as
elected by the surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days following the
later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year



 

10  after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for cash, without interest, to which such
holders may be entitled.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company
Restricted Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
directed by Parent. 

(g) _Withholdings_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock
Units and shares of Company Restricted Stock such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Section 3.3 _Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock;
Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

(a) _Treatment of Options_.

 

(i) _Options Outstanding Under the 1993 Plan and 2002 Plan_. As of the earlier
to occur of the Offer Closing and the Effective Time (such earlier time, the



 

11  "Acceleration Time"), each Company Option granted pursuant to the 1993 Plan
or the 2002 Plan (each a "1993/2002 Company Option") that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Acceleration Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder of
any 1993/2002 Company Option in consideration for the right at the
Acceleration Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Acceleration Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
1993/2002 Company Option as of immediately prior to the Acceleration Time and
(B) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such 1993/2002 Company Option, less any
required withholding Taxes (the "1993/2002 Option Cash Payment," and the sum
of all such payments, the "Total 1993/2002 Option Cash Payments"). As of the
Acceleration Time, all 1993/2002 Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each
holder of a 1993/2002 Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the 1993/2002 Option Cash
Payment. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company
shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3(a)(i)_.

 

(ii) _Options Outstanding Under the 2004 Plan_. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Option granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan (each a "2004 Company
Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), shall be canceled by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any 2004
Company Option and converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Common Stock previously subject to such 2004 Company Option and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Common Stock previously subject to such 2004 Company Option, less any
required withholding Taxes (the "2004 Option Cash Payment," and the sum of
all such payments, the "Total 2004 Option Cash Payments"), subject, however,
to any rights of such holder pursuant to _Section 3.5_. As of the Effective
Time, all 2004 Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a 2004 Company
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the 2004 Option Cash Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section
3.3(a)(ii)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Stock Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall become or
otherwise be deemed fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse and
each Company Restricted Stock Unit for which vesting accelerated
and restrictions lapsed at the Offer Closing, shall, in either case, be
canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of any Restricted Stock Unit in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock previously subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required
withholding Taxes



 

12  (the "Restricted Stock Unit Payment," and the sum of all such payments, the
"Total Restricted Stock Unit Payments"), subject, however, to any rights of
such holder pursuant to _Section 3.5_. As of the Effective Time, all Company
Restricted Stock Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock
Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Restricted Stock Unit Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3(b)_.

 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time each share of
Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall become or otherwise be
deemed fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse and each share of
Company Restricted Stock for which vesting accelerated and restrictions lapsed
at the Offer Closing, shall, in either case, be canceled by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any share of
Company Restricted Stock in consideration for the right at the Effective Time
to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required
withholding Taxes (the "Restricted Stock Payment" and the sum of all such
payments, the "Total Restricted Stock Payments"), subject, however, to any
rights of such holder pursuant to  _Section 3.5_. As of the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Restricted Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of shares of
Company Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Payment. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take the actions necessary to effectuate
this _Section 3.3(c)._

 

(d) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that as of the Effective Time (i) there
shall be no outstanding options issued or exercisable pursuant to the ESPP and
(ii) the ESPP shall terminate (without the commencement of any new offering or
purchase periods thereunder), in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding  _Section 3.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;

 



 

13  provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments
required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by
Parent (and not the Company or Acquisition Sub), and the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder
of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Merger Closing
Date. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any of the shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company with respect thereto, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall
be canceled against delivery of the applicable merger consideration, as
provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC after
December 31, 2009 and prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any
disclosure in such Company SEC Documents (i) that is set forth under the
captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" or (ii) that is
otherwise predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature), in each case,
only if the nature and content of the applicable disclosure in such Company
SEC Document is such that its relevance to a representation or warranty
contained in this _Article IV_ is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure or (b) as disclosed in any section of the separate definitive
disclosure letter which has been delivered by the Company to Parent prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") the
relevance of which to the applicable representation or warranty in this
_Article IV_ is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized
or formed, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization or formation. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability
company power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to

 



 

14  have such power, authority and governmental approvals would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to
date. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company
and the equivalent organizational or governing documents of each of the
Companys subsidiaries are in full force and effect. None of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the other
parties thereto, is in violation of any provision of such organizational or
governing documents, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of the Companys preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). As of October 6,
2010 (the "Capitalization Date"), (i) 27,354,636 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding (of which 956,540 were shares of
Company Restricted Stock), (ii) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (iii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held in treasury and
(iv) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by a subsidiary of the
Company. As of the Capitalization Date, there were (i) 265,613 shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP, (ii)
1,312,530 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance and not
subject to grants of equity awards under the Company Plans, (iii) outstanding
Company Options to purchase 253,843 shares of Company Common Stock and (iv)
unvested and outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units with respect to

interests in, the Company, or options, warrants or other rights to acquire
any such stock or securities were issued, committed to, reserved for issuance
or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are,
and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the ESPP and the Company Plans
will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to preemptive
rights. Since the Capitalization Date, no shares of capital stock of the
Company, no capital stock or other equity interests of any of the Companys
subsidiaries, and no other securities directly or indirectly convertible into,
or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock of the Company, or capital

been issued, other than shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the
exercise of Company Options or shares of Company Common stock issued upon the
vesting of Company Restricted Stock Units outstanding as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date.

(b) Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, of the
number of shares of

  

 

15  Company Common Stock subject to outstanding Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units (in each case, vested and unvested), the number of

Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and shares of Company Restricted Stock
have been granted, the dates of grant, the exercise prices thereof and the
vesting provisions thereof (if any). No bonds, debentures, notes or other

any matters on which holders of capital stock of the Company, or capital
stock or other equity interest of the Companys subsidiaries, may vote are
issued or outstanding. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or its subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any obligations binding

rights (other than in satisfaction of withholding Tax obligations pursuant to
certain awards outstanding under the Company Plans in the event the grantees
fail to satisfy withholding Tax obligations). Except as set forth in this
_Section 4.3_, there are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units, commitments, contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a

or valued by reference to the capital stock of the Company or capital stock
or other equity interests of its subsidiaries, dividends paid on the capital
stock of the Company or dividends paid or distributions made on the capital
stock of the Company (other than ordinary course payments to employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries (including bonus payments)). Neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries is party to or, to the knowledge of the Company,
bound by any contracts or understandings with respect to the voting (including
voting trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer (including agreements imposing
transfer restrictions) of any shares of its capital stock or other equity

Company Restricted Stock issued and outstanding under the Company Plans).

(c) Except as set forth above and except as expressly permitted under 
_Section 6.1_, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements, commitments

be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
any such security, option, warrant, call, right or contract.

of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity
interests of its subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens (other than any
Liens described in clause (i) on the definition of "Permitted Lien"). No
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of any subsidiary of the
Company have been reserved for issuance to anyone other than the Company or
any of its subsidiaries. Except for its interest in its subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock interest,
equity membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or
other equity interest in any person. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is obligated to make any contribution to the capital of,
make any loan to or guarantee the Indebtedness of any person (excluding the
Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries).

 

Section 4.4 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval (if required by applicable Law), to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the

the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and

its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and
to general equitable principles).

Stockholder Approval, conflict with or violate (x) the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or (y) the organizational or
governing documents of any of the Companys subsidiaries, (ii) assuming the
consents, approvals and authorizations specified in  _Section 4.5(b)_ have
been received and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and
any condition precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver
has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (iii) result
in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise in others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien, other than any Permitted Lien, upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture or credit agreement, or any



 

17  other contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, registration, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration,
cancellation or Lien that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction

other applicable U.S. or foreign competition, antitrust, merger control or
investment Laws (together with the HSR Act, "Antitrust Laws"), (iii) the DGCL
and (iv) the rules of NASDAQ, and except where failure to obtain such

is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
registrations, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders necessary for the Company or any of its subsidiaries to

to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Company Permits"),
and no suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending,
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of
the Company Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Laws_. To the knowledge of the Company, the
Company and its subsidiaries are, and since December 31, 2008 have been, in
compliance with, and have not received written notice of any default or
violation of, any Laws applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
bound or affected, in each case except for instances of non-compliance,

there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC by the Company.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and

or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading or (b) the proxy statement relating
to the adoption by the stockholders of the Company of this Agreement (together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") will, at
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time
of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

and its subsidiaries, other than those which would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 4.13 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no claim, action, audit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties or assets at law or in equity, and there are no Orders,

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA and
the Code, except for instances of noncompliance that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are
no pending, or the knowledge of the Company threatened, investigations by any
Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other claims (except
routine claims for benefits payable under the Company Benefit Plans) against

for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, other than any such
investigations, proceedings, or claims that would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) No Company Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan nor is any Company Benefit
Plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.
No



 

20  liability under Title IV of ERISA, Section 302, Section 409 or Section 502
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has been incurred by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of any
such liability being asserted, other than liability for premiums due the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which premiums have not been paid when
due) and other than liabilities that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualification
under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred since the date of such determination or opinion letter
that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect on such qualification or tax-exempt status. 

(d) No Company Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits or coverage beyond
termination of employment, except to the extent required under Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any similar state law.

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or

Material Contract").

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company is in breach of or
default under the terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach or

(other than Permitted Liens), except to



 

23  the extent disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of
the latest audited financial statements included in the SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.20 _Inventory_. Subject to any reserve therefor in the Companys
financial statements (as amended or restated, if applicable) included in the
Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2010, at

received) consisted of items of a quality usable or saleable in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and were in quantities
reasonably sufficient for the normal operation of the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries in accordance with past practices. Since July 31, 2010,
the Company and its subsidiaries have continued to replenish their Inventory
and to dispose of out-of-season and slow-moving Inventory in a normal and
customary manner consistent with past practices prevailing in the business
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries
maintain policies, practices and procedures with respect to the adequate
security and safeguard of Inventory and other assets (including, with respect
to employee and third-party theft and other loss), in each case consistent
with past practices prevailing in the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries. As used in this _Section 4.20_, the term "Inventory" means the
inventories of raw materials, work-in-process (including semi-finished goods)
and finished goods or products (including in-transit inventory) used, useable
or otherwise saleable in the ordinary course of the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries, calculated in accordance with the lower of cost or
market method, in accordance with GAAP.

Section 4.21 _Suppliers_. None of the ten (10) largest suppliers, vendors or
purchasing agents to the Company and its subsidiaries (determined by the
amount of total payments) for each of the twelve (12) month period ended

or otherwise discontinued, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to
reduce or discontinue, supplying such goods, materials or services to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or made, or threatened to make, any
change to the terms pursuant to which it has agreed to supply goods, materials
or services to the Company that is adverse to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except for such reduction, discontinuation or changes as would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.22 _Insurance_. Except as would no have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) all material insurance
policies maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries are in full force and
effect and all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and (b)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in breach or default of any
of the material insurance policies, and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has taken any action, or failed to take any action, which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default or
permit termination or modification of any of the material insurance policies.
Since January 1, 2010 through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has received any notice of termination or cancellation or, as
of the date hereof, denial of coverage with respect to any material insurance
policy maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material
claim made pursuant to any such insurance policy.

Section 4.23 _Opinions of Financial Advisors_. The board of directors of the
Company has received the opinions of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Peter J. Solomon
Company, on or prior

 



 

24  to the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinions and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
Offer Price payable to each holder (other than shares of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock, held by a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, held by Parent and its affiliates or Dissenting Shares) of
outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to the agreement is fair to such
holders from a financial point of view.

Section 4.24 _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the representation
contained in _Section 5.15_, the board of directors of the Company has taken
such actions and votes as are necessary to render the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other takeover or
anti-takeover statute or similar federal or state Law, including _Section
203_ of the DGCL (collectively, "Takeover Statutes") inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. There are no "anti-takeover" provisions in any organizational
documents of any of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company is not party to or
subject to a rights agreement, a "poison pill" or similar agreement or plan.

Section 4.25 _Vote Required_. If required by applicable Law, the affirmative
vote of the holders of outstanding Company Common Stock representing at least
a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast thereupon by holders of
Company Common Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote
of holders of securities of the Company that is necessary to adopt this
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.26 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker other than
Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Peter J. Solomon Company is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. Section 4.26 of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the Companys good faith estimate, as
of the date hereof, of the out-of-pocket fees and expenses it will incur to
any Third Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.27 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article IV_ and in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or the second paragraph of
_Annex I_, neither the Company nor any other person on behalf of the Company
makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or with respect to any other information provided to Parent or
Acquisition Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the accuracy, completeness or currency thereof. Neither the Company
nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other person
resulting from the distribution or failure to distribute to Parent
or Acquisition Sub, or Parents or Acquisition Subs use of, any such
information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts of
other material made available to Parent or Acquisition Sub in the electronic
data room for Project Giraffe run by Intralinks, Inc. and maintained by the
Company for purposes of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Electronic Data Room") or management
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless and to the extent any such information is expressly

  

 

25  included in a representation or warranty contained in this _Article IV_ and
in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or the second
paragraph of  _Annex I_.

ARTICLE V

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure letter which has been delivered
by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Parent Disclosure Letter"), Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof as
follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failures to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents), and other organizational or governing
documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to date, of each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub (collectively, "Parent Organizational Documents").
The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. None of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the
other parties thereto are in violation of any provision of the Parent
Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the

Acquisition Sub and the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the
Financing, have been or will be duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and, with respect to
Acquisition Sub, by its sole stockholder), and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the Financing (other
than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and 



 

26  delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable
against Parent and Acquisition Sub in accordance with its terms (except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to
general equitable principles).

Section 5.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Acquisition Sub, the consummation by Parent or Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger
and the Financing, or compliance by Parent or Acquisition Sub with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will (i) conflict with or violate the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of (x) Parent or (y) Acquisition Sub, (ii) assuming the
consents, approvals and authorizations specified in _Section 5.4(b)_ have
been received and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and
any condition precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver
has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or
Acquisition Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub
is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other
than, in the case of the Financing, any Lien required or permitted
thereunder) on any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Acquisition Sub is a party or by which Parent
or Acquisition Sub or any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub is
bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
violations, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations, amendments,
accelerations, or cancellations which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger
and the Financing, or compliance by Parent or Acquisition Sub with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will require any consent, approval,
authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority, except for applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws, any applicable Antitrust Laws, the
DGCL and the rules of NASDAQ, and except where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no claim,
action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or Acquisition Sub, threatened against Parent, Acquisition Sub, any Guarantor,
any of their respective affiliates or any of their respective properties or
assets, at law or in equity, and there are no Orders by or before
any arbitrator or Governmental Authority, in each case that, individually or
in the



 

27  aggregate, would reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no judgment outstanding against
Parent, Acquisition Sub, any Guarantor or any of their respective affiliates
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.6 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (a)
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i) agrees to tender
its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer or to vote to adopt this
Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its
shares of Company Common Stock in, any Superior Proposal; or (b) any third
party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity capital (other
than pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) to Parent or the Company to
finance in whole or in part the Offer or the Merger.

 

Section 5.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub expressly for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (a) the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9
or the Information Statement will, at the time such document is filed with the
SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time such
document is first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading or (b) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed
to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 

Section 5.8 _Financing_

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
the executed commitment letter from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
Credit Suisse AG and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., including any
related fee letter in redacted form (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant
to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties
thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein on the terms set
forth therein to Acquisition Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing"), and (ii) the executed
equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "Equity Commitment
Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Financing
Commitments") from Bain Capital Fund X, L.P. (the "Guarantor") pursuant to
which the Guarantor has committed to invest the amounts set forth therein on
the terms set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the
Debt Financing, the "Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and
will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary
thereto with respect to the provisions specified therein.

 



 

28 (b) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, the
other parties thereto. There are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and engagement
letters, complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, with
only the fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which would adversely
effect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted) relating to
the Financing Commitments between Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Guarantor, on the one hand, and the providers of the Financing, on the other
hand. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under any term, or a failure of any
condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any portion of
the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable on or before the Business
Day next succeeding the last day of the Marketing Period. Assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and
compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements hereunder, as of
the date of this Agreement neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to
believe that Acquisition Sub would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it.
Parent and/or Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and compliance by the Company of its
covenants and agreement hereunder and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions of the Financing, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing,
together with the cash and cash equivalents available to the Company, are
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment
in the Offer, the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the payment of all
associated costs and expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any
repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company required in connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or
contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

(c) As of the date hereof, Parent has no knowledge of any direct or indirect
limitation or other restriction on the ability of the lender parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter to provide financing for other potential purchasers of
the Company.

 

Section 5.9 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Acquisition Sub have delivered to the Company the Guaranty of the
Guarantor, dated as of the date hereof, in respect of the full amount of the
Reverse Termination Fee, all the fees and expenses payable by Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to this Agreement and all liabilities and damages
payable by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to _Section 8.2_, up to the
aggregate amount set forth therein. The Guaranty is in full force and effect
and is a valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable
against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium

 



 

29  and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles
of equity) and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could constitute a default on the part of any Guarantor under
the Guaranty.

Section 5.10 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1000
shares, par value $$0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or an assignee of
Parent in accordance with _Section 9.5_. Acquisition Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it
has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior
to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Interest in Competitors_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and Guarantor
do not own any interest, nor do any of their respective affiliates insofar as
such affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent, Acquisition Sub
or Guarantor under the HSR Act, in any entity or person that derives revenues
from products, services or lines of business within the Companys products,
services or lines of business.

 

Section 5.12 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
have not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

 

Section 5.13 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any
Guarantor.

 

Section 5.14 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Guarantor is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, Parents and
Acquisition Subs sole asset is cash in a _de minimis_  amount (less than
$1,000) and its sole liabilities are those incidental to its formation or
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming (i) that
the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time (and for the
avoidance of doubt, before giving effect to the incurrence of the Debt
Financing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Debt Financing), and (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ in
all material respects (but without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception contained
therein), at the Effective Time each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment
of the aggregate Offer Price and the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any
repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Debt



 

30  Commitment Letter, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

assuming the material accuracy of the estimates thereof set forth on Section
4.26 of the Company Disclosure Letter), be Solvent at and immediately after
the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.14_, the term "Solvent" means,
with respect to a particular date, that on such date, in each case on a

Acquisition Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to
conduct its business. For purposes of this _Section 5.14_, "debt" means any
liability on a claim, and "claim" means any (a) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured, and (b) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right
to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

Section 5.15 _DGCL Section 203_. Neither Parent or Acquisition Sub is, nor at
any time during the last three (3) years has either Parent or Acquisition Sub
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL.

 

Section 5.16 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities_. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent, the Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries do not
beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the

Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through
derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

 

Section 5.17 _WARN Act_. Parent and Acquisition Sub are neither planning nor
contemplating, and Parent and Acquisition Sub have neither made nor taken,
any decisions or actions concerning the Company Employees after the Closing
that would require the service of notice under the WARN Act or similar local
laws.

 

Section 5.18 _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations or understandings between any Guarantor, Parent or Acquisition Sub
or any of their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or the board of directors or any of the Companys
affiliates, on the other hand, relating in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after the
Effective Time.

 

Section 5.19 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that, as of the date
hereof and to the knowledge of



 

31  Parent, they and their Representatives (a) have received full access to (i)
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of
the Company which they and their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have
requested to review and (ii) the Electronic Data Room, and (b) have had full
opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the
business and assets of the Company. Parent and Acquisition Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and Parent and Acquisition Sub are not relying on any representation or
warranty except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or the second paragraph
of _Annex I_, (b) no person has been authorized by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or
its business or otherwise in connection with the Offer and Merger, and if
made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or
Acquisition Sub as having been authorized by such entity, and (c) any
estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum,
presentation or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their Representatives, including any
materials or information made available in the Electronic Data Room or in
connection with presentations by the Companys management, are not and shall
not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless and to the
extent any such materials or information is the subject of any express
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_ and in any certificate a
delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ or the second paragraph of _Annex I_.
Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that it has conducted, to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the condition, operations
and business of the Company and its subsidiaries and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and the Financing, each of Parent
and Acquisition Sub has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation.

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Proxy Statement_. Subject to _Section 6.6_,
the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within
three (3) Business Days, following the Solicitation Period End Date (or such
earlier date as the Company may determine in its sole discretion), prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. 

(b) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Amendments_. If the adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company
Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
(but may determine in its sole discretion to) mail the Proxy Statement prior
to the Solicitation Period End Date. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the
Companys or Parents subsidiaries, or their respective officers
or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively,
which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the
others. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement and shall otherwise

  

 

35  reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC). Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response
and shall in good faith consider such comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

Section 6.3  _Stockholders  Meeting_. If the adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law, the Company shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the later of (i) the Offer Closing
Date, (ii) the Offer Termination Date and (iii) the date on which the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the
rules of NASDAQ and the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the board of
directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 6.6(d)_ (but, for the avoidance of doubt, unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1,_ any such Adverse
Recommendation Change shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholder in accordance with
this _Section 6.3_), the board of directors of the Company shall make the
Company Recommendation with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after
consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting
(i) with Parents consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), as necessary to ensure that any required supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders Meeting,
and (ii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Stockholders
Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer Closing and
the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its affiliates shall
own at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
including with respect to the transfer to Acquisition Sub of any shares of
Company Common Stock held by Parent or its affiliates, to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

Section 6.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to all the terms and conditions hereunder (including _Section
6.6_), the parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to satisfy the conditions to the other partys (with respect to Parent and
Acquisition Sub) or other parties (with respect to the Company) obligations
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the taking of all acts
necessary to cause (A) in the case of the Company, the 



 

36  Offer Conditions set forth in _Annex I_ and the conditions to the Merger
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied, or (B)
in the case of Parent and Acquisition Sub, the conditions to the Merger
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents and approvals
from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Offer and the Merger, and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from,
or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other
persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, performed or consummated by
such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or consummated by such
party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully
the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (and
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the date that this
Agreement is executed) make and not withdraw its respective filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and
the Top-Up Option.

 

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take (and to cause their affiliates to
take) promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment and obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental
Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the
parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Offer and the Merger, as promptly as practicable, including committing to
or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise,
the sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Further, and for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent will take any and all actions necessary in order to
ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-action by or consent or approval
of the Antitrust Division, the FTC or other foreign or U.S. Governmental
Authority with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Laws, and (z) no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Laws, would preclude consummation of the Offer or
the Merger by the Termination Date.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective
subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Parent shall use, and
cause each of its affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its
efforts, to obtain any third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and
(b) above that are necessary or, in Parents reasonable judgment, proper or
advisable to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
promptly reimburse 



 

37  the Company for any reasonable expenses and costs incurred in connection
with the Companys or its affiliates obligations under this _Section
6.4(c)_. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and
will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including immediately informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, in each case other
than as prohibited by applicable Law and except for so-called 4C documents and
other documents customarily withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
obtaining any third party consents pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ shall
not be considered a condition to the obligations of the Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.4_ or any
other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to seek to obtain the Financing shall be as set forth in _Section 6.12_.

 

Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and contracts, and subject to the reasonable
restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel, the Company
will provide to Parent, Acquisition Sub, their respective financing sources
and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors
(including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
investment bankers, and financial advisors), agents and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Companys and its subsidiaries properties,
books, contracts and records and other information as Parent may reasonably
request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other
aspects of the Company and its subsidiaries (but not including access to
perform physical or environmental examinations or to take samples of soil,
ground water, air or products);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement
with any Third Party entered into prior to the date hereof in a material way,
(ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company, or (iii) otherwise materially violate any applicable Laws (with
respect to each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, it being agreed that
the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding
such information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a
breach, waiver or violation).

 

(b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent may provide information of the
type covered by the Confidentiality Agreement to potential sources of debt or
equity financing (including prospective lenders and investors) and to



 

38  rating agencies during syndication of the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing), subject to customary confidentiality arrangements with
such persons regarding such information. 

Section 6.6 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the day that is forty (40) days
following the date of this Agreement (the "Solicitation Period End Date"), the
Company and its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have
the right (acting under the direction of the board of directors of the Company
or any committee thereof) to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate and encourage any Competing Proposals, including by way of
providing access to non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to)
one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any material non-public information concerning the Company or
its subsidiaries provided to any Third Party given such access shall, to the
extent not previously provided to Parent or Acquisition Sub, be provided to
Parent or Acquisition Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no
event later than 48 hours) after it is provided to such Third Party (which
requirement may be satisfied by posting such information to the Electronic
Data Room); and (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with respect to any Competing Proposal or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such
discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Competing
Proposal. In addition, the Company shall not provide any
commercially sensitive non-public information to any competitor of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the actions contemplated
by this _Section 6.6_, except in a manner reasonably designed to protect the
Company if no Alternative Acquisition Agreement is agreed to with such
person.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.6_, from and after the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Representatives to (i) cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Third Parties
that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal, and (ii) request
any such Third Party to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries. Except as expressly
permitted by this  _Section 6.6_, the Company shall not, and shall cause
each of its Representatives not to, from and after the Solicitation Period End
Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal, (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or afford access to the
books or records or officers of the Company or its subsidiaries to, any Third
Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, is seeking to make, or has made,
a Competing Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or
publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal
(an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); (iv) take any action to make the
provisions of any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a

 



 

39  Competing Proposal; or (v) terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the
Company in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than
to the extent the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take any
of such actions under clauses (iv) or (v) would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and is
necessary to facilitate a Competing Proposal in compliance with _Section
6.6_), or propose to do any of the foregoing. No later than two (2) Business
Days following the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, if
requested by Parent or Acquisition Sub, notify Parent and Acquisition Sub in
writing of the identity of Exempted Persons that submitted a Competing
Proposal on or before the Solicitation Period End Date and an unredacted copy
of their Competing Proposals (including any materials relating to such
Exempted Persons proposed debt financing, if any), and will keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material changes to the terms of such Competing
Proposal or relating financing. Notwithstanding the commencement of the
obligations of the Company under this  _Section 6.6(b)_, from and after the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section 6.6(b)_
with respect to a Competing Proposal submitted by an Exempted Person on or
before the Solicitation Period End Date (and not subsequently withdrawn) until
11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the 20th day following the Solicitation Period
End Date (the "Cut-Off Date"), including with respect to any amended or
revised Competing Proposal submitted by such Exempted Person on or before the
Cut-Off Date (but not a withdrawn Competing Proposal); _provided_ , _however_
, that, only in the case of clause (iii) above, the obligations in _Section
6.6(d)_, _Section 6.6(e)_ and _Section 6.6(f)_) shall apply at all times to
all Competing Proposals of any Exempted Person.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.6(b)_,
at any time after the Solicitation Period End Date and prior to the earlier
to occur of the Offer Closing and obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company or its board of directors, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (i) furnish nonpublic information to
any Third Party making a Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the
Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries
provided to any Third Party given such access shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Parent or Acquisition Sub, be provided to Parent or
Acquisition Sub as promptly as reasonably practicable after it is provided to
such Third Party (which requirement may be satisfied by posting such
information to the Electronic Data Room)), and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Third Party with respect to the Competing Proposal if:
(x) such Third Party has submitted a Competing Proposal which the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that in each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, such Competing Proposal was not
solicited in violation of this _Section 6.6_. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in this _Section 6.6(c)_, the Company shall notify Parent
and Acquisition Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-
public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 6.6(c)_.



 

40 (d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.6(d)_, neither the board
of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Recommendation; (ii) fail to include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or (iii) after the
Solicitation Period End Date (or if there is any Competing Proposal from an
Exempted Person outstanding as of the Solicitation Period End Date, the Cut
Off Date), if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of
the Company that constitutes a Competing Proposal is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
stockholders of the Company (including, for these purposes, by taking no
position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer
by the stockholders of the Company, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer)
within ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof; (iv) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal
made or received after the date hereof (any of the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 6.6(d),_ an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"); or (v) cause or permit the Company to enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
Offer Closing and obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of
directors of the Company shall be permitted (x) to terminate this Agreement
to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section 6.6(e)_ and the concurrent
payment of any amount owed the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3_, if the
board of directors of the Company (A) has received a Competing Proposal that,
in the good faith determination of the board of directors of the Company,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Acquisition Sub
pursuant to, _Section 6.6(e)_, and (B) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition, if the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(e) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under  _Section 6.6(d)_
with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Parent and Acquisition Sub
that the Company intends to take such action that includes an unredacted copy
of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (including the
identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal and any debt
financing materials related thereto, if any), (ii) during the three (3)
Business Day period following Parents and Acquisition Subs receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Acquisition Sub in good faith
(to the extent Parent and Acquisition Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments and the Guaranty so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii) following the end of the three (3)
Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments and the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent and
Acquisition Sub in response to the Notice of



 

41  Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to
the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.
Any material amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and
the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 6.6(e)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that references to the three (3)
Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period.

 

(f) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty eight (48)
hours), provide Parent and Acquisition Sub an unredacted copy of any Competing
Proposal or any request for non-public information in connection with any
Competing Proposal (including the debt financing materials related thereto,
if any), and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within forty eight (48) hours) advise Parent and Acquisition Sub of any
material amendments to any such Competing Proposal or request.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
the Companys stockholders) if the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that any disclosures permitted under _Section 6.6(g)(i) _(that is not also
permitted under _Section 6.6(g)(ii)_) and that is not an express rejection
of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its
recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any bona fide written proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as
determined on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any person of
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value basis; (iii) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any person of fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity or 



 

42  voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company as determined on a book-value basis.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Proposal (with all
percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to more than
fifty percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as
the board of directors of the Company considers to be appropriate (including
the conditionality, certainty of financing and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal on the terms proposed), are more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to all
adjustments to the terms thereof which may be offered by Parent in writing
(including pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)_).

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation
and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or
its subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or each of the Companys
subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts
or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by: (x) the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement and (y) any indemnification agreement of the
Company or its subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees with
respect to their acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.7(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law: (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to: (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnitees capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any 



 

43  of its subsidiaries; or (y) the Offer, the Merger, the Agreement and any
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this  _Section
6.7(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not
include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee and (ii)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement, compromise, consent to the entry of judgment or termination unless
such settlement is approved in advance by the Surviving Corporation, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to
any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are
insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy
of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

44 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_. The provisions of this _Section
6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
6.7_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnitee with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this  _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such
press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the
other parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except that not such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto.

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
employees and former employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries,
while employees of the Company or any

 



 

45  of its subsidiaries ("Company Employees") a base salary or wage rate at
least equal to the Company Employees base salary or wage rate in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and compensation and benefits, other
than equity based benefits, that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable in
the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than equity based
benefits) being provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.10_, (i) during the
one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to Company Employees who
experience a termination of employment severance benefits that are no less
than the severance benefits (other than any equity based benefits), if any,
that would have been provided under a Company Benefit Plan to such employees
upon such a termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Companys and its
subsidiaries obligations under any Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ __,
that nothing in this _Section 6.10(b)_ or in _Section 6.10(a)_ shall be
construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to maintain any
particular or any combination of particular benefit plans, programs or
arrangements or as limiting the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to (i) amend or terminate any plan, program or arrangement, including any
Company Benefit Plan, in accordance with its terms as in effect on the date
hereof, or (ii) terminate the employment of any Company Employee.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of
level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs
agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), including for purposes
of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under
New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before
the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during
the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement constitutes or shall be construed as
constituting an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

46 (e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of any Company Benefit
Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control,"
the earlier to occur of the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control."

Section 6.11 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Acquisition Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date
hereof and the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent and Acquisition Sub:

(a) shall not, and shall not permit any of its affiliates to, acquire or agree
to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of
any person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such business competes in any line
of business of the Company and the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation
could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,
declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 

(b) shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, prior to the
Termination Date, enter or agree to enter into any definitive agreement for
the acquisition of any business or person or take or agree to take any other
action which in either case would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with their ability to make available to the Paying
Agent immediately prior to the Effective Time funds sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the
payment of all associated costs and expenses (including any refinancing of
indebtedness of Parent or the Company required in connection therewith) or
otherwise would be reasonably expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not, prior to
the Effective Time, incur any liability to any person under any financing that
Parent and Acquisition Sub may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this 
_Section 6.12_ and that Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical financial information provided in writing
relating to the Company and its subsidiaries).



 

47 (b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain
the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letters (subject to any market flex provisions applicable
thereto), including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (subject to any market
flex provisions applicable thereto) as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, (ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
respective Representatives that are within their respective control in such
definitive agreements, (iii) cause the lenders and any other persons providing
the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing at the Offer Closing (with
respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger) and (iv) subject
to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, cause the Equity
Financing to be funded at the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required
to consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts
required to consummate the Merger).

 

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing (unless the Equity Financing or Debt Financing, as the case may be,
is increased by an amount corresponding to such reduction) or (ii) impose new
or additional conditions that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Parent shall not release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an individual
lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Debt
Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters.

(d) In no event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their affiliates
(which for purposes of this _Section 6.12(d)_ shall be deemed to include each
direct or indirect investor or potential investor in Parent or Acquisition
Sub, or any of Parents, Acquisition Subs or such investors financing
sources or potential financing sources or other Representatives) (i) award any
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person
any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis (or until the Solicitation
Period End Date, any additional firm or person on a non-exclusive basis) in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
(ii) prohibit or seek to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing from providing or seeking to
provide financing or financial advisory services to any person in connection
with a transaction relating to the Company or its subsidiaries or in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Except as required by _Section 6.12(e)_, until the Solicitation Period End
Date, neither Parent, nor Acquisition Sub nor any of their affiliates shall
seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity financing in respect of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, or
provide any information in respect thereof to any potential 



 

48  investor in Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any of Parents, Acquisition Subs
or such investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
Representatives who have not been provided any such information prior to the
date of this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (i)
Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain,
and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company than those in the Financing Commitments, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Offer Closing Date or the Merger Closing Date, as applicable). The definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
6.12(e)_ or _Section 6.12(b)(i)_ are referred to in this Agreement,
collectively, as the "Financing Agreements."

 

(f) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or any
alternative financing, is a condition to the Offer Closing or the Merger
Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, or the completion
of any such issuance, subject to the Offer Conditions and the applicable
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or, if the Offer Termination shall
have occurred, the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_, the breach of which obligation will give rise to the remedies
set forth _Section 8.3_ and  _Section 9.9_.

(g) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement promptly
upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach or material threatened breach by any party of any of the Financing
Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing Agreements,
or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or Acquisition Sub
becomes aware or any termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or
any alternative financing), provided that Parent shall be under no obligation
to disclose any information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar
privilege.

 

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation_. Subject to Section 6.12(a), the Company
shall and shall cause its subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense,
reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (for
purposes of this Section 6.13, including (x) any financing to be issued or
incurred in lieu of the bridge facility in the Debt Commitment Letters or
pursuant to any flex applicable to the Debt Financing and (y) any alternative
financing) as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such

ongoing operations of the Company and its subsidiaries). Such cooperation by
the Company and its subsidiaries and their representatives shall include, at
the

 



 

49  reasonable request of Parent, (a) participation in a reasonable number of
meetings, drafting sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence
sessions, (b) furnishing Parent and its Representatives with the Required
Information, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the

Offer Closing, the Merger Closing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters), and (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff
letters, redemption notices, releases of liens and instruments of termination
or discharge and (vi) using its reasonable best efforts to permit any cash and
marketable securities of the Company and its subsidiaries that can, without
violating Laws or incurring material Taxes, reasonably be made available to
pay a portion of the aggregate purchase price, to be made available for that
purpose. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos in
connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used in a manner
that is not intended to harm or disparage the Company or their marks and on
such other customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably
impose. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this Agreement, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in
connection with the Companys or its affiliates obligations under this
Section 6.13. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any

any alternative financing) prior to the Effective Time.

Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness.

 

Section 6.15 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its subsidiaries operations.

Section 6.16 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt

compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or
will be entered into after the date of this Agreement by the Company or its
subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the

 



 

50  Company or its Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

 

Section 6.17 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to
ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 6.18  _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_.

Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

ARTICLE VII

 

 _CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER_

 

Section 7.1 _Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party_. The respective
obligations of each party to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Company and
Parent at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

 

(a) if required by applicable Law, the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall
have been obtained;

 

(b) any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act
relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer or the consummation of the Merger shall have expired or otherwise been
terminated;

(c) no Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law or Order which is then in effect and has the
effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, preventing or imposing adverse
conditions on the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Offer, the
Top-Up Option or the consummation of the Top-Up Option or the Merger or the
consummation of the Merger; and

 

(d) unless the Offer Termination shall have occurred, Acquisition Sub shall
have accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

Solely if the Offer Termination shall have occurred, then the respective
obligations of Parent and Acquisition

the following further conditions: 

(a) each of the representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in
_Section 4.11(b)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) shall be true and

Companys Indebtedness, indirectly acquire all of the outstanding equity
interests in the Companys subsidiaries, and consummate the related
transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date and pay all fees and

Offer Termination shall have occurred, then the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of
the following further conditions:

 

(a) each of the representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub
contained in this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality or
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" qualifications) shall be true and correct,
except for such failures to be true and correct as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect as of
the Effective Time with the same effect as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date);

 



 

52 (b) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have performed or complied in all
material respects with all material agreements and covenants required by this

extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section
6.6(d) and Section 6.6(e)_, and (y) concurrently with such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
and pays to Parent the fee specified in _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_); or

 

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1 _and _Section 7.2_

_Section 2.5_; _provided_ , however, that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this subsection prior to the end of the Extension

cured by the Company prior to the earlier of (1) thirty (30) days of receipt
by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure and (2) the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if the
Offer Closing shall have occurred; or

 



 

54 (ii) (x) the board of directors of the Company shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the

terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to Section 8.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and all rights and obligations
of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages (which
the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
Expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include, to the extent proven, the
benefit of the bargain lost by a partys stockholders (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and
the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages
of such party) resulting from any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the
applicable remedies available under _Section 8.3_; and _provided_
further, that the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guaranty, the provisions of
_Section 6.12(a)_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_ (first
sentence only), _Article IX_ and _Appendix A_ shall survive any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_. 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or 
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)(x)_, and (y) the Company (A) receives or has received a
Competing Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof, which Competing
Proposal is publicly disclosed either (I) at or prior to the time of the
Stockholders Meeting or (II) prior to the termination of this Agreement if

an amount equal to $50,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") not later than the
second (2nd) Business Day following the date of the consummation of such
transaction arising from such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "more than fifty percent (50%)"; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any Parent Expenses previously paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ shall be credited towards the payment of the
Termination Fee;

55  documentation thereof, reimburse Parent for all Expenses by paying, or
causing to be paid, to Parent the amount thereof not later than the second

_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay more than an
aggregate of $9,500,000 pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ (the "Parent
Expenses");

 

(iii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)(y)_, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with such termination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)(y)_ and either (x) such
termination occurs on or before the Solicitation Period End Date, or (y) the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with an Exempted Person with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.6_ on or before
the Cut-Off Date, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent,
or such person who may be designated by Parent, a Termination Fee equal to
$30,000,000 instead of $50,000,000; or 

(iv) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_,  _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or
_Section 8.1(c)(iv)_, then (A) if the proceeds of the Financing are
unavailable at the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to
consummate the Offer) or the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required
to consummate the Merger) (other than as a result of a breach by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of _Section 6.12(b)_) pursuant to the terms of the Financing
Commitments, and all the conditions under _Annex I _or  _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.2_, as applicable, have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Closing or
the Merger Closing, as applicable), Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company an amount equal to $50,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") not
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination or (B)
if the proceeds of the Financing are available to be drawn down at the Offer
Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) or the
Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger)
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments or if the failure of the
proceeds of the Financing to be available to be drawn down at the Offer
Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) or the
Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger)
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments is the result of a breach
by Parent or Acquisition Sub of _Section 6.12(b)_, and all the conditions
under _Annex I_ or _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_, as applicable, have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as applicable) and the
Offer Closing and the Merger Closing do not occur, then (y) Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to the Reverse Termination
Fee not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination;
and (z) the Company shall be entitled to payment from Parent of an amount
equal to the Companys aggregate losses, if any, in excess of the Reverse
Termination Fee resulting from Parent or Acquisition Subs material breach of
this Agreement (but subject to the Parent Liability Limitation). For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, the aggregate liability of Parent and Acquisition Sub under
this Agreement shall in no event exceed that the Parent Liability Limitation.



 

56 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 

(i) the parties agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Termination Fee, the Reverse Termination Fee or the Parent
Expenses, as the case may be, on more than one occasion; and

(ii) the parties agree that the Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination
Fee shall be reduced by any amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys right set forth in the second to last sentence of
this _Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 9.9_, the Companys right to receive
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)(A)_
shall, in the circumstance where the Reverse Termination Fee is owed pursuant
to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)(A)_, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (including the holders of Company
Common Stock, 1993/2002 Company Options, 2004 Company Option, Company
Restricted Stock Units or Company Restricted Stock) and the other Company
Related Parties against Parent, Acquisition Sub, each Guarantor, the financing
sources under the Debt Financing or any of their respective, direct
or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for all
losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that Parent shall also be obligated to the Company
under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)(B)_ and  _Section 8.3(e)_ and for any of its
expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in _Section
6.12_, but in all cases subject to _Section 8.3(d)_). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section
9.9_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination
Fee or the Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and
its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Related Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated thereby (except that the Company shall
also be obligated to Parent and Acquisition Sub under _Section 8.3(e)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable
relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to cause, or for the Company to
directly cause, the Equity Financing to be funded at any time if, and only if,
each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) with respect to any
funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Offer Closing, all the Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived as of the expiration of the Offer,
and, with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the
Merger Closing, all conditions in  _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature cannot



 

57  be satisfied until the Merger Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the
time when the Merger Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the
Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt
Commitment Letter has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be
funded in accordance with its terms at the Offer Closing or the Merger
Closing, as applicable, if the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with
its terms at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, as applicable, (iii) all
conditions to funding set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Merger Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions), and (iv) with respect to any funding of the Equity
Financing to occur at the Merger Closing, the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Merger Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance of the type provided in the preceding sentence and the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the preceding
sentence and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of Parent and Acquisition Sub under or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to
$130,000,000 (the "Parent Liability Limitation"), and in no event shall the
Company seek multiple or punitive damages against Parent or Acquisition Sub,
or any recovery, judgment or damages or any kind against Parent or Acquisition
Sub in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation. The Company acknowledges,
covenants and agrees that neither it nor any other Company Related Party
has and shall have no right of recovery against, and no liability shall
attach to, including in each case with respect to any actual or claimed loss
or damages of any kind of the Company or its subsidiaries, affiliates,
Representatives or stockholders or any other person claiming by, through or
for the benefit of the Company ("Company Damages"), any of the Parent Related
Parties (other than the Companys right to recover against Parent and
Acquisition Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement, against the
Guarantor to the extent provided in the Equity Commitment Letter and against
the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guaranty), through Parent or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of Parent, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, through a claim
based in tort, contract, statute or otherwise.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee and the
Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent or their
respective affiliates, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such
fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this

 



 

58   _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this
_Section 8.3_, such paying party shall pay the other party its costs and
Expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser
rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred
or receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) after the Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases
the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration, and (b) after the Requisite
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of
such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject
to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the

Section 9.3  _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a person
are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars"
or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America. References to
"wholly owned subsidiaries" of the Company shall include any subsidiary of
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the equity interests.
An Offer Condition shall be deemed to be satisfied at any time if such Offer
Condition shall not have occurred on or prior to such time or, if such Offer
Condition shall have occurred prior to such time, such Offer Condition shall
not be continuing at such time.

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid
or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long
as the economic or legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties

 



 

61  as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Offer and the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Merger
Closing, Parent or Acquisition Sub may assign all (but not less than all) of
its rights or obligations hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Guaranty, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, the entire agreement, and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties and their affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

Section 9.7  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended
to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (a) the rights of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, (b) the right of the holders of Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Restricted Stock to receive
the 1993/2002 Option Cash Payment, 2004 Option Cash Payment, Restricted Stock
Unit Payment or Restricted Stock Payment, as applicable, at the Effective
Time, (c) the provisions of _Section 6.7_ with respect to the Indemnitees,
(d) the provisions of  _Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_ with respect
to the Parent Related Parties and (e) the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_,
_Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 9.10(c)_ and _Section 9.12_, with respect to
any Financing Source in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. None of the persons referenced in clauses
(a) through (c) of this _Section 9.7_ shall be conferred any rights or
remedies hereunder unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware.



 

62 Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do
not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions and
that, accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity; provided,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement shall be limited
to seeking (i) an injunction ordering Parent and Acquisition Sub to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with and subject to the conditions
set forth in, the second to last sentence in _Section 8.3(c)_, and (ii) an
injunction to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub set forth in _Section 6.12(b)(i)_, _Section 6.12(b)(ii)_ and _Section
6.12(b)(iii)_. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief sought in
accordance with this _Section 9.9_ on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions in accordance with this Agreement to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or the Financing and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Financing shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in the

Delaware state or federal court.

summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of

such party and nothing in this _Section 9.10_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (b)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this

it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (d) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the
State of



 

63  Delaware). Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located
within the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court, and
that the provisions of _Section 9.12_ relating to the waiver of jury trial
shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim.

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Conditions to the Offer

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (relating to Acquisition Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered
shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of
the Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer if:

 

(a) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior
to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock
which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and
its Affiliates, would represent at least sixty-six percent (66%) of the shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer (the
"Minimum Tender Condition"); or

(b) any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act and any other Antitrust Laws relating to the purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger shall not
have expired or otherwise been terminated; or

 

(c) a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred; or

 

(d) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

 

(i) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
or entered any Law or Order which is then in effect and has the effect of
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation
of the Offer, the Top-Up Option or the consummation of the Top-Up Option or
the Merger or the consummation of the Merger, or preventing, prohibiting or
imposing adverse conditions with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the Top-
Up Option;

(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company (A) set forth
in _Section 4.11(b)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) shall not be true
and correct in all respects at and as of the Offer Closing, (B) set forth in 
_Section 4.3_ (Capitalization), without giving effect to any materiality or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications therein, shall not be true
and correct in all material respects at and as of the Offer Closing with
the same effect as though made as of the Offer Closing (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date) and (C)
set forth in _Article IV_ hereof (other than the Sections of _Article IV_
referred to in clause (A) or (B) above), without giving effect to any
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications therein, shall
not be true and correct at and as of the Offer Closing (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except
in the case of clause (C) for such failures to be true and correct as would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 



 

78  Solely for the purposes of clause (B) above, if one or more inaccuracies in
_Section 4.3_ would cause the aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent
to effectuate the Merger, refinance the Companys Indebtedness, indirectly
acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in the Companys subsidiaries,
and consummate the related transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date
and pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, including pursuant to
_Article II_ or _Article III_ , to increase by $3,000,000 or more, such
inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered material for purposes of clause
(B) of this clause (d)(ii).

 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it under this Agreement; or

(iv) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
or

(e) in the event that the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to
ensure that Parent or Acquisition Sub owns at least ninety percent (90%) of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately after the Offer
Closing, the shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option together with the shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn are insufficient for Acquisition Sub to reach at least
ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately
after the Offer Closing (after giving effect to such exercise).

At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate,
signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer or another
senior officer, certifying that none of the conditions set forth in clause (c)
above and clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (d) above shall have occurred
and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer.

Notwithstanding anything in this _Annex I_ or this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this _Annex I_ (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Offer Closing), then the Offer Closing shall occur instead on the date
following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest
to occur of (a) any Business Day before or during the Marketing Period as may
be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days prior notice to
the Company and (b) the first (1st) Business Day after the final day of
the Marketing Period. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall be
deemed to constitute an Offer Condition.

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub to extend, terminate or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable
Law, may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum
Tender Condition). The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub 



 

79  at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
