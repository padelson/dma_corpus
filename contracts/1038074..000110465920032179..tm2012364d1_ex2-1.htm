Capital and the Severance Amount, respectively, and, based on such

Adjustment Statement to Seller, Purchaser shall afford Seller a reasonable
opportunity to examine, including by remote access, the statements and such
supporting schedules, analyses, work papers, and other underlying records or

Purchaser a written objection notice setting forth in reasonable detail the
reasons for which Seller does not agree with the calculation of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement or if the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
is not delivered within 60 days of the Closing, then the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be deemed final and binding on the
parties. If Seller delivers the objection notice within such period, then
Purchaser and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections.
In the event Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement calculations after good faith negotiations for a period

(b) _Adjustment of Closing Cash Consideration_. If the Closing
Cash Consideration, as finally determined, is greater than or equal to the

full Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. Without limiting the foregoing,
if the difference between the Closing Cash Consideration and the Estimated
Closing Cash Consideration is greater than the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount (an  " _Underpayment_ "), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
amount of such Underpayment by means of a wire transfer of immediately
available funds. If the Closing Cash Consideration, as finally determined, is
less than the Estimated Closing Cash Consideration (an " _Overpayment_ "),
then Purchaser and Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release out of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow an
amount equal to the Overpayment and distribute the remainder of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, to Seller. Without limiting the
foregoing, if the Overpayment is greater than the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount, then Purchaser may, at its option, either (1) instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Fund, by means of a wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of such difference, or (2) require
Seller to pay such difference to Purchaser by means of a wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser, in which
case Seller shall make such payment as directed by Purchaser. Any payments
required to be made under this Section 2.5(b) shall be payable no later than

items (and only the disputed items) for resolution to an independent
accounting firm mutually appointed by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "), who shall determine and report to the
parties and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto. If the Purchaser and Seller cannot agree on the Independent
Accounting Firm, the parties agree to engage the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") to appoint the Independent Accounting Firm, and
Seller and Purchaser will each initially pay half of any fee that the AAA
charges in connection with such services. None of Seller or Purchaser or
their respective representatives will have any ex parte communications or
meetings with the Independent Accounting Firm concerning any matter arising
under or related to this Agreement or any dispute referred to the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Seller or Purchaser, as applicable. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
determine any disputed items within 30 days after they are submitted to it. If
any disputed items are submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution, (i) the proceedings, if any, shall be held in a mutually agreed
location, (ii) each party shall furnish to the Independent Accounting Firm
such work papers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and are
available to that party or its Affiliates (or its independent public
accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Independent Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination of the
matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Independent
Accounting Firm, (iii) each of the parties shall assign a value to each
disputed item and the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine each
disputed item separately (based on the determination that most closely
complies with the terms of this Agreement) but shall not assign a value to
any disputed item that is greater than the greatest value for such disputed
item assigned to it by either party or less than the smallest value for such
disputed item assigned to it by either party, (iv) the Independent
Accounting Firm shall make its calculation of the disputed items in
accordance with this Agreement and shall set forth such calculation
in reasonable detail in a written notice and deliver such notice to both
parties, and such calculation shall be binding and conclusive on the parties
and constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof.
Purchaser and Seller shall each bear its own fees and expenses in connection
with any such proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm.

Accounting Firm for resolution. The Independent Accounting Firm's
determination as to each disputed item shall be final and binding upon the

extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No written claim has
been made by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where any Group Company has not
filed Tax Returns that any Group Company is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. No Group Company is subject to income Tax in any country
other than its country of formation by virtue of having a permanent
establishment or other place of business in that country. The Company has
provided to Purchaser in the Electronic Data Room copies of all income Tax
Returns and all other material Tax Returns filed by the Group Companies for
all taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2015. None of the Purchased
Assets include any interest in any joint venture, partnership or other
arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income
Tax purposes. None of the Group Companies has engaged or participated in any
transaction that would constitute a "listed transaction", a "reportable
transaction", or a transaction substantially similar to a "listed
transaction" or "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4 or Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and similar
state or local Tax Laws.

  



  

(b) _Tax Payments; Accruals; Withholding_. The Group Companies
have timely paid all Taxes that have become due (whether or not shown as due
on a Tax Return), and will timely pay all Taxes that become due prior to the
Closing. All Taxes that the Group Companies were required to withhold or to
collect for payment have been withheld or collected and, to the extent
required, have been timely paid to the appropriate Tax Authorities and the
Group Companies have complied with all information reporting requirements in
respect of such payments, including maintenance of required records with
respect thereto, and all Forms W-2 and 1099 required with respect thereto
have been properly completed and timely filed. Each Person providing services
to any of the Group Companies has been properly classified as an employee or
independent contractor, as the case may be for all Tax purposes. There are no
liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of the Group Companies other than
liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

is outstanding, assessed or proposed in writing against any of the Group
Companies. No Group Company has executed any agreements or waivers extending
any statute of limitations on or extending the period for the assessment or
collection of any Tax, which waiver or extension is currently in effect. No
Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being
conducted with respect to any of the Group Companies, except as set forth on
Section 3.20(c) of the Target Disclosure Schedule. No Group Company has
granted any power of attorney with respect to any Tax matter which is
currently in force. No issues relating to Taxes were raised by a Tax
Authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be
expected to recur in a taxable period not yet audited. No Group Company has
received from any Tax Authority (including jurisdictions where the Group
Company has not filed Tax Returns) any written (i) notice indicating an intent
to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax
matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any Tax Authority against
the Group Company. The Company has delivered to Purchaser correct and
complete copies of all Tax Authority examination reports and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any of the Group Companies. No
Group Company has requested or received any private letter rulings, technical
advice memoranda or similar rulings or guidance issued by any Tax Authority.

  



  

(d) _Liability for any Other Person 's Taxes_. The Company and
each of the Group Companies is not and has never been a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than a group, the
common parent of which is the Company) and the Group Companies have no
liability for Taxes of any other Person (other than a Group Company) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Tax Law),
as a transferee or successor or by contract (excluding contracts entered into
in the ordinary course of business the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes). No Group Company is a party to any Tax-sharing
agreement, Tax allocation agreement, Tax indemnity agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement (whether or not written) with any other Person. No
Group Company has assumed any obligation to pay any Tax obligations of, or
with respect to any transaction relating to, any other Person (including any
Affiliate of the Group Companies) or agreed to indemnify any other Person
(including any Affiliate of the Group Companies) with respect to any Tax.

  



  

(e) _Stamp Taxes; FIRPTA_. Each document relating to any Group
Company's assets which required a stamp, and each agreement entered into by

documents and agreements has been paid.

3.21 _Employee Benefit Plans._

  



  

(a) No Target Employee Plan provides for severance, separation, or
termination pay to employees, other than as required by Law.

  



  

(b) Section 3.21(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of each Target Employee Plan. No Group Company has
at any time been a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has
been obligated to contribute to, or had any Liability with respect to any
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any retiree medical or retiree life
insurance arrangement.

  



  

(c) The Company has delivered to the Purchaser: (i) a complete
copy of each Target Employee Plan as amended (or a summary of any oral Target
Employee Plan) and (ii) a copy of any and all rulings or non-routine notices
issued by a governmental authority, with respect to each such Target Employee
Plan.

  



  

(d) Each of the Target Employee Plans has been established,
maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and
conditions and with the Law applicable to such Target Employee Plan. Each
Group Company has provided all benefits required by Law. All contributions to
the Target Employee Plans (including any pension plans) have been timely made
or are properly accrued, and no Group Company maintains a defined benefit
pension plan. No Target Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, including but
not limited to any Liabilities with respect to Provident Fund Organization
contributions, except for those that are fully offset by insurance. Each
Target Employee Plan that is intended to be tax-qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is a prototype or volume submitter plan that is pre-
approved by the IRS and covered by a currently-effective favorable IRS opinion
or advisory letter. Nothing has occurred and no circumstance exists that
could be reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualified status of such
Target Employee Plan. No condition exists that would prevent the Group
Companies or Purchaser from terminating or amending any Target Employee Plan
at any time for any reason.

  



  

(e) There are no suits, actions, disputes, claims (other than
routine claims for benefits), arbitrations, audit, administrative or
other proceedings pending or threatened (in writing) with respect to any
Target Employee Plan or any related trust or with respect to any of the Group
Companies, as the sponsor or fiduciary thereof, nor, to the Company's
Knowledge, is there any reasonable basis therefor. No Target Employee Plan or
any related trust or other funding medium or any fiduciary is the subject of
an audit, investigation or examination by a Governmental Entity.

  



  

(f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or
other service provider of the Group Companies or their respective Affiliates
to severance benefits or any other additional payment (including golden
parachute, bonus or benefits under any Target Employee Plan), except as
expressly provided in this Agreement (including the Schedule of Employees and
Consultants); or (ii) except as set forth in Section 3.21(f) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or

of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay or any other payment; (ii)

Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

works council, employee representative or other labor organization or
collective group, nor, to the Company's Knowledge, are there any
activities or proceedings of any labor union, works council, employee

pursuant to applicable Law or agreement, must be notified, consulted or with
which negotiations need to be conducted in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Group Companies have provided all

payable, as of the date hereof, and the Group Companies have provided all
consultants and independent contractors with all fees that have become due

respect to the matters set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization, Existence, and
Good Standing), Section 3.2 (Authority), Sections 3.3(a)-(b) (Consents),
Section 3.4 (Broker), Section 3.5 (Insolvency) and Section 3.9 (Title of
Property and Assets) (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") or with respect
to Fraud and (b) the Termination Date with respect to all other
representations and warranties (the " _Standard Representations_
"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by an Equityholder,
recovery for Damages may only be sought and recovered by Purchaser Indemnified
Persons from the Equityholder who provided such representation, warranty or
covenant.

  



  

(b) _Indemnity_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 8 each Indemnifying Party will severally and not jointly (except
for Equityholders that are immediate family members or a trust, limited
liability company, or similar estate planning vehicle established by or for
the benefit of an Equityholder and/or any Related Party of such Equityholder
(" _Related Parties_ ") which shall be jointly and severally liable with
their Related Parties) (according to their respective Percentages)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser, any other direct or indirect
subsidiary of Purchaser (including Purchaser Subsidiary) and their respective
agents, representatives, officers, directors and employees (each an "
_Purchaser Indemnified Person_ ") from and against any Damages arising out of
or in connection with:

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(i) any inaccuracy in, or any breach of, any representation or
warranty made by any Group Company or Equityholder in this Agreement or in
any Transaction Agreement or certificate delivered hereto provided that for
breaches by an Equityholder recovery for Damages may only be sought and
recovered from the Equityholder in breach;

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed by any
Group Company or Equityholder pursuant to this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement or certificate delivered hereto provided that for
breaches by an Equityholder recovery for Damages may only be sought and
recovered from the Equityholder in breach;

  



  

(iii) the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities; or

  



  

(iv) Fraud (a) by any Group Company under this Agreement or under
any Transaction Agreement to which a Group Company is party or (b) by any
Equityholder; provided that for this subsection (iv)(b) recovery may only be
sought and recovered from the Equityholder who committed such Fraud.

  



  

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 8, to the extent that
the Company has not distributed all proceeds to its Equityholders, the Company
shall be liable for any Damages covered under this Article 8 as provided in
this paragraph. To the extent that the Company has distributed proceeds to an
Equityholder, such Equityholder shall be liable for any Damages covered under
this Article 8 in accordance with such Equityholder's Percentage and the
Company shall have no liability therefore. To the extent any
Equityholder's Percentage of the proceeds from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement remain with the Seller, the Seller shall be liable for
Damages hereunder with respect to such proceeds to the same extent an
Equityholder would be liable pursuant to this Agreement. For clarity, the
Company shall only be responsible for the portion of such Equityholders
Percentage that has not been distributed to such Equityholder in accordance
with his, her or its Percentage of the available distributions. The Company
shall update the Closing Certificate to set forth all distributions to the
Equityholders.

  



  

(c) _Right to Bring Claim_. Purchaser and Seller each agree that
Purchaser, and only Purchaser, may bring a claim in its own name to
recover on its own behalf for Damages that are economic losses of Purchaser
Indemnified Person that Purchaser Indemnified Persons are entitled to
recovery for in accordance with this Article 8.

  



  

(d) _Materiality Disregarded_. For purposes of determining (i)
the amount of any Damages with respect thereto and (ii) whether a breach has
occurred, all representations and warranties of the Group Companies that are
qualified as to "materiality," "material,"  "Material Adverse Effect," or
other similar qualifications shall be deemed to be not so qualified.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(e) _Essential Term_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Person to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 8.1 are an essential part of the economic terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. An Purchaser Indemnified
Person's rights to indemnification under this Agreement shall in no way be
limited or eliminated or otherwise affected by the fact that such Purchaser
Indemnified Person, or any of its directors, officers, employees or advisors,
was at any time prior to or as of the Closing or the execution of this
Agreement aware (or should have become aware) of any fact (including that any
representation or warranty was untrue or incorrect or that any covenant or
agreement had been breached) other than as set forth in this Agreement or the
Target Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement by Seller as an
adjustment to the Cash Consideration for income Tax purposes, to the
extent permitted by Law.

  



  

(g) _Purchaser Indemnification_. Purchaser shall indemnify the
Equityholders and each of respective agents, representatives, officers,
directors and employees, (the " _Equityholder Recipient Indemnitees_ ")
against and from all Damages incurred by any Equityholder Recipient
Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or by virtue of (a) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by Purchaser
to Seller in Section 4; (b) any material breach by Purchaser of any of the
covenants or obligations made by them under this Agreement (including the
obligations under this Article 8) or (c) any Assumed Liabilities; provided
that, this Section 8.1(g) shall not restrict the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
from seeking recovery for breaches of the representations and warranties as
provided in this Agreement. Any claim pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) may be
made only by Seller on behalf of the Equityholders or in the event Seller
experiences a change of control, dissolution or otherwise winds up its
affairs, Seller's designee. Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees Seller it
will satisfy any indemnification obligation of Purchaser or its Affiliates to
the Equity Recipient Indemnitees that Purchaser or its Affiliates does not
fulfill.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the survival period in this Section 8.1 is
intended to and hereby does replace the applicable statutes of limitations
that would otherwise apply to a claim for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement.

  



  

8.2 _Escrow Period; Release From Escrow_. The remaining Escrow
Amount (after satisfaction of any indemnification claims) shall be delivered
to the Equityholders in accordance with their respective Percentages within
five Business Days following the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any amount contained in a Pending Claims Account shall be retained by the
Escrow Agent until such claims have been resolved.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

8.3 _Claims Process_. On or before the Termination Date,
promptly after becoming aware of the existence of potential Damages or a
Third-Party Claim, Purchaser shall be entitled to deliver to the Escrow Agent
and Seller a certificate signed by an officer of Purchaser (an " _Officer 's
Certificate_") stating Purchaser's good faith belief that Damages exist (or
are reasonably expected to exist with respect to an identified matter) or that
there has been an assertion in writing against any Purchaser Indemnified
Person of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry
or proceeding brought by a third party against any Purchaser Indemnified
Person (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that if
successfully prosecuted, would give rise to the indemnification obligations
of the Indemnifying Parties set forth in Section 8.1, and specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages included in the amount
so stated, the date each such item was paid, or properly accrued or arose,
and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or claim
to which such item is related. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Officer's Certificate is given on or prior to the Termination Date, no delay
on the part of the Purchaser in giving the Indemnifying Parties an Officer's
Certificate shall limit or reduce the Indemnifying Party's right to indemnity
hereunder, nor relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations,
unless an Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced thereby. Upon
receipt of an Officer's Certificate, the Escrow Agent will, as more
particularly provided in the Escrow Agreement, segregate from the Escrow Funds
into a separate account (the " _Pending Claims Account_ ") a portion of the
Escrow Amount as necessary to satisfy and pay (if and when it is determined
that such amount is owed) the amount of the claim as stated in the Officer's
Certificate. The Escrow Agent will distribute the Escrow Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 8, if Damages exceed the available Escrow Funds, Purchaser is hereby
authorized at any time thereafter and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, to obtain repayment from the Equityholders to the
extent any Escrow Funds or Cash Consideration has already been paid to the
Equityholders (and the Equityholders shall promptly facilitate each of the
foregoing remedies). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover under
this Agreement unless an Officer's Certificate has been delivered to Seller
on or before the applicable survival period for such claim provided in
Section 8.1. If Seller shall object in writing to any claim or claims by
Purchaser made in any Officer's Certificate, Purchaser shall have 30 days to
respond in a written statement to the objection of Seller. If after such 30
day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, Seller and Purchaser
shall attempt in good faith for an additional period of up to 45 days to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims, provided that if no agreement is reached, no amounts shall be owed by
the Indemnifying Parties or recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
until a final decision, judgment or award has been rendered with respect to
the indemnification matters set forth in the Officer's Certificate (including
a declaratory or similar judgment that the Purchaser Identified Persons are
entitled to indemnification) and the time in which to appeal therefrom has
expired.

  



  

8.4 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event a Purchaser Indemnified
Person becomes aware of a Third-Party Claim that Purchaser believes
may result in an indemnification claim pursuant to this Section 8, Purchaser
shall notify Seller of such claim (but the failure to deliver such notice
shall not limit Purchaser's rights under this Agreement). Purchaser shall
consult with Seller prior to entering into a settlement of any claim that
would result in Damages being paid from the Escrow Funds or by the
Indemnifying Parties. Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or otherwise
resolve any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed;
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall have no right to consent to the
part of any such settlement, compromise or resolution which does not have any
adverse impact on or cost to the Indemnifying Party. In the event that Seller
has consented to any settlement of a Third-Party Claim with regard to a
specific dollar amount of Damages, neither Seller nor the Equityholders shall
have any power to dispute (under Section 8.3, Section 8.4 or otherwise)
Purchaser's right to indemnity hereunder with respect to such settlement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller's outside legal
counsel shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim at its own cost and expense to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties
would reasonably be likely to have exposure beyond the Initial Escrow Amount.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

8.5 _Limitations on Recovery_.

  



  

(a) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy Pursuant to this Agreement_.
Following the Closing, the indemnification rights provided in this Section
8 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to Damages of any kind or nature arising out of or in connection
with any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise, other than in accordance with Section 9.12 hereof and with respect
to Fraud by any Equityholder, provided that recovery for Fraud by an
Equityholder may only be recovered from such Equityholder. The parties may
not avoid the limitations on liability, recovery and recourse set forth in
this Article 8 by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to
any other theory or liability. Nothing in this Section 8.5(a) shall
prevent or prohibit a party from seeking and/or obtaining specific
performance in accordance with Section 9.12.

  



  

(b) _Cap on Liability_. The recourse of the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Agreement with respect to: (i) the
Standard Representations (except for Section 3.14(c)(i)) shall be limited to
the Escrow Amount (until released); (ii) Section 3.14(c)(i) shall be limited
to the Escrow Amount (until released); and (iii) with respect to all other
matters (other than with respect to Fraud by any Equityholder or its
Affiliates) shall be limited to the Cash Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, only the perpetrator of Fraud may
be liable in excess of the Cash Consideration. With respect to any
situation in which multiple sections are applicable, the higher limit shall
be applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
no event shall any Equityholder's liability for Damages hereunder exceed the
amount of proceeds actually received by such Equityholder as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in the case of Fraud by
such Equityholder.

  



  

(c) _Threshold for Certain Claims_. No claim for Damages shall be
made with respect to the Standard Representations unless all Damages of all
Purchaser Indemnified Persons hereunder, in the aggregate, exceed $875,000, in
which case the Purchaser Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Damages from the first dollar (without regard to the
limitation set forth in this Section 8.5(c)).

  



  

(d) _No Limitation on Additional Agreements_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit (A) recovery or recourse of the Purchaser or its Affiliates from a
Person that enters Employment Documents or other agreements in connection
with this Agreement to the extent that such Employment Documents or other
agreements pursuant to its terms permits such recourse or remedy by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates; or (b) the liability in amount or otherwise of
any Equityholder with respect to Fraud by such Equityholder.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(e) _No Subrogation_. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
that an Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 8, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be entitled to exercise,
or be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity,
rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or any of its subsidiaries or other Affiliates may have
against any other Person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter
to which such indemnification is directly or indirectly related.

  



  

(f) Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover
under Section 8:

  



  

(i) to the extent Damages are actually paid by insurance
(including title insurance), indemnification rights or similar rights to
recovery, and Purchaser or Purchaser Indemnified Persons receives payment
thereunder; and

  



  

(ii) to the extent such Damages are taken into account or reserved
for in the calculation of the Closing Cash Consideration (and
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall only be entitled to recover, subject to
the other applicable limitations provided herein, in excess of such reserve).

  



  

(g) In calculating the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8,
the amount of any Damages shall be determined net of any amounts actually
recovered by any Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or Purchaser Indemnified Person
under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to such Damages. Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any such amount from the
RandW Insurance Policy (including taking commercially reasonable steps to
appeal any denial of a claim). If payment from the RandW Insurance Policy is
received by Purchaser after indemnification is received by Purchaser
hereunder, Purchaser shall promptly pay to the applicable Equityholders the
amount recovered by it from the RandW Insurance Policy for which Purchaser had
been otherwise indemnified hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser will not be required to refund amounts actually received from an
insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy to the extent a Purchaser Indemnified
Person's total Damages exceed the limits in the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall any Purchaser Indemnified Person be entitled to indemnification,
reimbursement or other recovery for any amount to the extent any Purchaser
Indemnified Person has already been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount
under any other provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

60

 



    



   



  

(i) Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this
Article 8 and the Escrow Agreement, any Damages payable by an
Indemnifying Party to any Purchaser Indemnified Person pursuant to Article 5
or this Article 8 shall be payable (i) first, to the extent applicable and
not released, from the Escrow Amount up to the amount of the RandW Insurance
Policy Retention (such amount the " _Initial Escrow Amount_ ") in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, (ii) second, to the extent the Damages exceed the
Initial Escrow Amount or in the event the Initial Escrow Amount is released,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, by recovery from the
RandW Insurance Policy and (iii) third, to the extent the Damages exceed the
Initial Escrow Amount or in the event the Initial Escrow Amount is released
and the RandW Insurance Policy limits are exhausted or coverage under the RandW
Insurance Policy is unavailable (subject to Purchaser's obligations pursuant
to the second sentence of Section 8.5(g)), subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, then recovery may be sought from the remainder of
the Escrow Amount and the Indemnifying Parties as may be permitted pursuant to
this Section 8\. For purposes of clarity, except in the case of Fraud,
Purchaser and Parent acknowledge and agree that any Purchaser Indemnified
Person must first make claims for payment for any such liability, to the
extent covered under the RandW Insurance Policy, against the RandW
Insurance Policy. The RandW Insurance Policy shall be deemed to have been paid
by all of the Equityholders to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Persons
(regardless of which loss payee is actually paid under the RandW Insurance
Policy) and such deemed payment shall be taken into account when determining
the Equityholders liability hereunder, if any.

  



  

  

(j) No exculpation from liability, right of indemnification,
advancement or other recovery in favor of any director or officer of
any Group Company shall be applicable to benefit such individual to the
extent such recovery would reduce any Damages of a Purchaser Indemnified
Person that the Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to recovery for
hereunder.

9.2 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. The Group
Companies will take all such commercially reasonable and lawful action as may
be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the
Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Purchaser with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Seller, the officers and directors of Seller are fully
authorized in the name of Seller or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

  



  

9.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood
that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest; Assignment_. This
Agreement, the Transaction Agreements, the exhibits and schedules hereto
including the Target Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement,
together constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, including the letter of intent, dated October 3, 2019
and as amended on January 4, 2020. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties
to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer
any such rights, upon any other Person. This Agreement shall not be assigned
by operation of law or otherwise without the written consent of Purchaser.

  



  

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

any and all remedies expressly conferred in this Agreement upon a party will

expressly conferred by this Agreement.

be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of

courts having jurisdiction of appeals in such courts, the  "Chosen Courts").
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably accepts and submits, for itself and in
respect of its properties, to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts,

inconvenient forum.

holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or

supplemented, revised, or modified, in writing, from time to time, (f)
reference to any Law shall be construed as a reference to such Law as re-
enacted, redesignated, amended or extended from time to time prior to the
date hereof, (g) the information contained in the Schedules is
disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement (h) when calculating the
period of time within which or following which any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, if the last day of such period is not a
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next Business Day, and
(i) the phrases "provided to," "made available," "furnished to," and phrases
of similar import when used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise
requires, shall mean, with respect to any statement in this Agreement to the
effect that any information, document, or other material has been
"delivered" or "provided" to the Purchaser or its legal counsel, that such
information, document, or material was (x) to the Company's Knowledge, true
and correct at the time it was made available or delivered to the Purchaser or
its legal counsel and (y) made available for review by the Purchaser or its
representatives in the Data Room, in each case, at least one Business Day
prior to the Closing Date.

9.10 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended and any
provision hereof may be waived at any time, in each case, only by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by each of Purchaser and Seller.
The failure of a party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist
upon strict adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion
shall not be construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right
thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement at a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver
of any other term of condition hereof (whether or not similar) unless
explicitly waived.

  



  

  

9.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Unless a provision of this
Agreement specifically grants a right or benefit to a third party, there are
no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement and no third party has any
rights under this Agreement or any of its provisions.

  



  

9.12 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. Purchaser and
Seller each agree that Seller's business is unique and recognize and affirm
that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages
would be inadequate and would have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
Purchaser and Seller each agree that each party that is harmed by a breach of
this Agreement shall have the right, in addition to any other lawful rights
and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and its
counterparty's obligations under this Agreement not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief, in each case without
the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages. If any such
action is brought by a party to enforce this Agreement, the party against whom
such action is brought hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law.

  



  

9.13 _Target Disclosure Schedule_. No disclosure of any matter
contained in the applicable Target Disclosure Schedule shall create an
implication that such matter meets any standard of materiality (matters
reflected in the applicable Target Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the
applicable Target Disclosure Schedule; such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters
of a similar nature, nor shall the inclusion of any item be construed as
implying that any such item is "material" for any purpose).

  



  

9.14 _Waiver of Conflict; Treatment of Company Confidential
Information_. The parties acknowledge and agree that subsequent to
the Closing, any Equityholder (collectively, the " _Former Holders_ " or
individually, the " _Former Holder_ ") shall have the right to retain
Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP (" _Pillsbury_ ") to represent any Former
Holder's interest(s) in any dispute even if such representation relates to or
arises out of this Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement, any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any Purchaser (collectively, the " _Dispute_
"). The Purchaser and Parent and each of their subsidiaries hereby
irrevocably waive, consent to and covenant not to assert any objection, based
on conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of any Former
Holder by Pillsbury in any Dispute. The Purchaser further agrees that, as to
all pre-Closing privileged or otherwise protected materials relating to
Pillsbury and the Dispute including materials protected by the attorney-
client privilege, work product, the expectation of client confidence and all
other rights to any applicable privilege or immunity (" _Privileged Deal
Materials_ ") are hereby (i) deemed the sole property of the Seller and (ii)
shall only be controlled, reviewed, utilized or otherwise accessed by the
Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by any Purchaser on any ground,
including waiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that
Privileged Deal Materials do not include communications that constitute
evidence of Fraud by the Former Holders or the Seller. Except as to the
Privileged Deal Materials, any other pre-Closing privileged communications
maintained by the Seller shall be the sole property of the Seller.

9.15 _Limitation on Warranties_. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that except as expressly set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement or
as expressly set forth by any Group Company in any Transaction Agreement, none
of the Group Companies or any of its representatives has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, to Purchaser or any of its
representatives in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In connection with the due diligence investigation of
the Group Companies by Purchaser and its Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, Purchaser and its
Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives and advisors have received and may continue to
receive, after the date of this Agreement, from the Group Companies and their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents, representatives and advisors certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Group Companies and the
businesses and operations thereof. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, and that Purchaser will have no claim against the Group Companies, or
any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other
person with respect thereto unless any such information is expressly addressed
or included in a representation or warranty contained in Section 3 of this
Agreement or as expressly set forth in any Transaction Agreement by any
Group Company. Accordingly, Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that
neither the Group Companies nor any of their Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or
advisors, nor any other person, has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward looking statements or business plans unless any such
information is expressly addressed or included in a representation or
warranty contained in Section 3 of this Agreement or as expressly set forth in
any Transaction Agreement by any Group Company.
