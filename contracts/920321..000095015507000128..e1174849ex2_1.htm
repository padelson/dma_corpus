1.4 _Purchase  Price Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) On  or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Stockholders' Representative shall: (i) determine the Estimated Closing
Working  Capital and the Estimated Closing Debt; and (ii) deliver to Buyer a
written  statement (the " **Preliminary Statement** ") setting forth in 
reasonable detail the calculation by the Stockholders' Representative
thereof  and the computations used in connection therewith. In the event
Buyer  disagrees with the Estimated Closing Working Capital or Estimated
Closing Debt  reflected on the Preliminary Statement, Buyer shall notify the
Stockholders' Representative of such disagreement within two Business Days
after receipt  thereof (the " **Buyer Disagreement Notice "**), such Buyer 
Disagreement Notice to include the amount Buyer believes to be the correct 
Estimated Closing Working Capital or Estimated Closing Debt, as the case may 
be. If the Buyer Disagreement Notice is not received by the  Stockholders'
Representative within such two Business Day period, the  Estimated Closing
Working Capital or Estimated Closing Debt as included in  the  Preliminary
Statement shall be used in order to determine the Initial Purchase  Price. If
the Buyer Disagreement Notice is received by the  Stockholders'
Representative within such two Business Day period,  then: (i) in the event
the Buyer Disagreement Notice disputes  the Estimated Closing Working Capital
as included in the Preliminary Statement,  the Estimated Closing Working
Capital used in order to determine the Initial  Purchase Price shall be the
lower of: (A) the Estimated Closing  Working Capital as included in the
Preliminary Statement; and (B) the  Estimated Closing Working Capital as
included in the Buyer Disagreement Notice;  and (ii) in the event the Buyer
Disagreement Notice disputes the Estimated  Closing Debt as included in the
Preliminary Statement, the Estimated Closing  Debt used in order to determine
the Initial Purchase Price shall be the greater  of: (A) the Estimated
Closing Debt as included in the  Preliminary Statement; and (B) the Estimated
Closing Debt as included in  the Buyer Disagreement Notice.

 

 

(b) Within  100 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the  Stockholders' Representative a written statement (the "
**Statement** ") setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation  of
Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt.

 

 

(c) During  the 30-day period following the receipt by the Stockholders'
Representative of  the Statement, the Stockholders' Representative and his
representatives shall be  permitted to review during normal business hours
and make copies reasonably  required of (i) the working papers of Buyer, the
Company and, if relevant,  its independent auditors relating to the
preparation of the Statement and  (ii) any supporting schedules, supporting
analyses and other supporting  documentation relating to the preparation of
the Statement. The  Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the thirtieth  day  following delivery thereof, except to the extent that
the Stockholders' Representative gives written notice of disagreement with
the Statement (the  " **Notice of Disagreement** ") to Buyer prior to such 
date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (A) specify in reasonable  detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted (any such disagreement to  be 
limited to whether such calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing 
Debt  are mathematically correct and/or have been prepared in accordance with
the  definitions of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt, and the
definitions  included in such definitions) and (B) if independent auditors
are engaged  by the Stockholders' Representative in connection with the
preparation of the  Notice of Disagreement, be accompanied by a certificate
of the independent  auditors of the Stockholders' Representative that they
concur with each of  the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

BACK 

 

 

 

 



 

 

positions  taken by the Stockholders' Representative in the Notice of 
Disagreement. If a Notice of Disagreement complying with the  preceding
sentence is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement  (as
revised in accordance with clause (I) or (II) below) shall become final 
and  binding upon the parties on the earlier of (I) the date Buyer and the 
Stockholders' Representative resolve in writing any differences they have
with  respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (II)
the  date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting  Firm.

 

 

(d) During  the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement that  complies with the preceding paragraph, Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences  which they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of  Disagreement. During such period, Buyer and its independent
auditors  shall be permitted to review and make copies reasonably required of
(i) the  working papers of the Stockholders' Representative and, if relevant,
the  designated independent auditors (if any) of the Stockholders'
Representative  relating to the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement and
(ii) any  supporting schedules, supporting analyses and other supporting
documentation  relating to the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. If,
at the  end of such 30-day period, the differences as specified in the Notice
of  Disagreement are not resolved, the Stockholders' Representative and Buyer
shall  promptly engage KPMG LLP (the " **Accounting Firm** ") and submit to 
the Accounting Firm for review and resolution of any and all matters which 
remain in dispute and which are properly included in the Notice of 
Disagreement. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm  shall: (i)
be bound by the provisions of this Section 1.4 and  the definitions of
Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and the definitions  included in
such definitions; (ii) limit its review to matters still in  dispute as
specifically set forth in the Notice of Disagreement (and only to  the 
extent such matters are still in dispute following such 30-day period); and 
(iii) further limit its review solely to whether the Statement has been 
prepared in accordance with this Section 1.4. The determination of  any item
that is a component of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and  is  the
subject of a dispute cannot, however, be in excess of, or less than, the 
greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for any particular item in 
the  Statement or the Notice of Disagreement (or, if different, the value
claimed  by  the relevant party at the end of such 30-day period). The 
Stockholders' Representative and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to 
cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters in
dispute  within 30 days following the submission of such matters to the
Accounting  Firm. The Stockholders, the Stockholders' Representative and
Buyer  agree that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting  Firm  in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination  is to be enforced. Except as specified in the
following sentence, the  fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
connection with the Accounting  Firm's determination of Closing Working
Capital or Closing Debt pursuant to this  Section 1.4 shall be borne, in its
entirety, by the party (or, in the case  of  the Stockholders, the
Stockholders jointly and severally) whose calculation  of  the Final
Purchase Price based upon its calculation of Closing Working Capital  and
Closing Debt as initially submitted to the Accounting Firm) is furthest 
away  from the Final Purchase Price based upon the Closing Working Capital
and Closing  Debt as determined by the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses
of  the Buyer's independent auditors (if any) incurred in connection with
the  issuance of the Statement shall be borne by the Buyer, and the fees and
expenses  of the independent auditors of any Stockholders or the
Stockholders' Representative incurred in connection with their review of the
Statement shall  be borne by the Stockholders.

(e) If  the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price,
Buyer  shall, within five Business Days after the final determination of
Closing  Working Capital and Closing Debt, make payment to the Stockholders
(to each  Stockholder in proportion to the respective percentages set forth
next to his,  her or its name on _Schedule 1.1(b)(i)_ ), by wire transfer of
immediately  available funds of the amount of such excess, together with
interest thereon  at  the rate of 6% per annum (the " **Rate** "),
calculated on the basis  of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day
year, from the Closing Date  to the date of actual payment, compounded
annually. If the Final  Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase
Price, the Stockholders  (jointly and severally) shall, within five Business
Days after the final  determination of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Debt, make payment to  Buyer  by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, of the amount of such excess,  together with interest thereon at the
Rate, calculated on the basis of the  actual number of days elapsed and a
360-day year, from the Closing Date to  the  date of actual payment,
compounded annually. Buyer and the  Stockholders agree that if any amounts
are owed by the Stockholders to Buyer  under this Section 1.4(e), Buyer may
at its election proceed against the escrow  fund being held by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in order  to  recover such amounts or
directly against the Stockholders.

 

 

(f) Any  payment required to be made under this Section 1.4 shall be deemed
an adjustment  to the Final Purchase Price.

 

 

1.5 _Withholding  Taxes_. To the extent required by applicable Law, Buyer
shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold any Taxes required to be withheld
from any  payments due to the Stockholders at any time pursuant to this
Article I; and  such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having  been  paid to the Stockholders.

beneficiaries  or dependents, whether or not written, other than a
Multiemployer Plan  (" **Benefit Plans** "). Neither the Company, nor any
of  its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates has communicated
to  present or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or  formally adopted or authorized, any additional Benefit Plan or any change
in  or  termination of any existing Benefit Plan. No Benefit Plan covers

(the " **Code** "), has received a favorable determination letter from the 
IRS as to its tax-qualified status under the Code and nothing has occurred 
since  the date of such favorable determination letter which would adversely

Subsidiaries,  other  than continuation coverage required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Sections  601-608 of ERISA (" **COBRA** ") or as set forth on
_Schedule  2.15(n)_.

 

 

(f) Since  January 29, 2005, there has been no change in any Benefit Plan, or
its related  funding vehicle, which would significantly increase the cost of
the Company  or  its Subsidiaries, or the benefits payable, with respect to
such  plan.

 

 

(g) _Schedule  2.15(g)_ sets forth a true and complete list of each
"multiemployer  plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA)  maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any  of  their respective ERISA Affiliates, or to which
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates is obligated to  contribute or has any liability (contingent or
otherwise) (a  **" Multiemployer Plan"**). Neither the Company nor any of
its  Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (i) has
incurred,  or  is reasonably likely to incur, a "complete withdrawal" or a
"partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA)  with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, (ii) has
engaged in a transaction that  is subject to Section 4212(c) of ERISA, (iii)
has received any  notification, or has any reason to believe, that any
Multiemployer Plan is  in  reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent
or may reasonably be expected  to be in reorganization, to be insolvent or to
be terminated, or  (iv)

the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the terms of any
Multiemployer  Plan (including, but not limited to, the trust agreement for
such  plan). During the last six years, neither the Company, nor any of its 
Subsidiaries nor or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is or has ever 
been  a party to any multiple employer plan, as that term is defined in
Section 413(c)  of the Code, or a multiple employer welfare arrangement, as
that term is defined  in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

 

 

(h) No  Benefit Plan is a "defined benefit plan", within the meaning of
Section 3(35) of  ERISA, or a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and
neither the Company  nor  any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
(contingent or otherwise) with respect  to any such plan.

 

 

(i) No  event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to any
Benefit Plan  which could subject any Benefit Plan, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, directly  or indirectly (through an indemnification agreement
or otherwise), to a  liability for a breach of fiduciary duty, a "prohibited
transaction," within the  meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, or a tax, penalty  or fine under ERISA or the Code.

 

 

(j) No  actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in
the Ordinary  Course) are pending with respect to any Benefit Plan or, to the
Knowledge of  the  Company and the Stockholders, threatened, and the Company
and the Stockholders  have no Knowledge of any facts which could give rise to
any such actions, suits  or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in
the Ordinary  Course). No Benefit Plan is currently under governmental 
investigation or audit and, to the Knowledge of the Company and the 
Stockholders, no such investigation or audit is contemplated or under 
consideration.

 

 

(k) No  event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to any
employee benefit  plan or arrangement currently or previously maintained or
contributed to by  any  Affiliate of the Company (other than a Benefit Plan
or Multiemployer Plan listed  on _Schedule 2.15(g)_ ) which could subject the
Company or its Subsidiaries  to liability, including liability under Section
412, 4971 or 4980B of the Code  or Title IV of ERISA.

 

 

(l) Except  as set forth on _Schedule 2.15(l)_ , neither the execution of
this Agreement  nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will  (i) increase the amount of benefits otherwise payable under
any Benefit Plan,  (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
exercisability, funding  or vesting of any such benefits, or (iii) result in
any payment (whether  severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to, or with
respect to, any current  or  former employee or director of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. No  payment or series of payments that would constitute an
"excess parachute  payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
has been made or will  be made by the Company or its Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, to any  employee in connection with the execution of this
Agreement or as a result  of  the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(m) Substantially  adequate and complete records have been and are maintained
with respect to  each  Benefit Plan and are in the custody of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or a  third party service provider retained by the Company
or its  Subsidiaries.

adversely on,  harm  the reputation of, or encourage any adverse action
against, the Company or  its  Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its
Representatives or Affiliates or any of  any  of the products or services of

Affiliates.

 

 

(e) The  parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in 
Sections 6.7(a), (b), (c) and (d) are a reasonable and necessary protection 
of the immediate interests of Buyer, and any violation of these restrictions

entered  into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents without
receiving the  additional consideration offered by the Stockholders in
binding themselves  to  these restrictions. In the event of a breach or a
threatened breach  by the Stockholders or any Affiliate of the Stockholders
of these restrictions,  Buyer will be entitled to an injunction restraining
the Stockholders or their  Affiliates, as applicable, from such breach or
threatened breach (without the  necessity of proving the inadequacy as a
remedy of money damages or the posting  of a bond); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to injunctive relief  will not be construed as prohibiting
Buyer from pursuing any other available  remedies, whether at law or in
equity, for such breach or threatened  breach.

 

 

(f) In  consideration of the significant financial benefit to be received by
the  Stockholders hereunder, the parties agree that 1% of the Final Purchase

of the Shares; and the Company and the  Stockholders shall not, and shall not
permit or authorize any of their  respective Representatives or Affiliates
to, solicit, initiate or encourage  or  take any other action to facilitate,

agreement with any Person other than Buyer  concerning the sale, transfer or
other disposition of capital stock of the  Company or its Subsidiaries or the
merger, consolidation, sale of securities  or  any other transaction
involving, directly or indirectly, the Company or its  Subsidiaries, or any
substantial portion of the assets of the Company or its  Subsidiaries. The
Company and the Stockholders shall notify Buyer of  any inquiry or proposal
promptly after receipt or awareness of the  same.

 

 

6.9 _Taxes_.

 

 

(a) The  Stockholders shall pay and jointly and severally indemnify Buyer and
its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries)  from  and against all Taxes required to be paid by the
Company or its Subsidiaries  with respect to any taxable periods of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that  end  on or prior to the Closing Date to
the extent such Taxes exceed the accruals  for  such Taxes reflected in the
Closing Working Capital (as finally  determined). The Stockholders'
Representative shall cause the  preparation of all Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for taxable  periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date. Such Tax Returns  shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice except as  otherwise

required  by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Tax Returns shall be
prepared  on a basis consistent with any settlements of Tax audits for
prior  years. No later than 30 days prior to the filing of any such Tax 
Returns, the Stockholders' Representative shall provide to Buyer copies of
such  Tax Returns for review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed. Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
filed, all  Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable
periods beginning  prior to but ending after the Closing Date (any such
period, a " **Straddle  Period** " ) and for periods beginning after the
Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) The  Stockholders shall pay and jointly and severally indemnify Buyer and
its  Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries)  from  and against Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries
allocable to the portion  of  a Straddle Period which ends on the Closing
Date to the extent such Taxes exceed  the accruals for such Taxes reflected
in the Closing Working Capital (as finally  determined). For purposes of this
Section 6.9(b), in the case of  any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Straddle  Period, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such tax period  ending on the Closing Date shall
(i) in the case of any Taxes other than  Taxes based upon or related to
income, receipts or purchases, be deemed to  be  the amount of such Tax for
the entire tax period multiplied by a fraction,  the  numerator of which is
the number of days in the portion of the tax period ending  on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the  entire tax
period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to  income,
receipts or purchases, be deemed equal to the amount which would be  payable
if the relevant tax period ended on the Closing Date, except that 
exemptions, allowances and deductions (such as depreciation deductions) 
calculated on an annual basis shall be prorated between the portion of the 
applicable Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date and the portion
after  the Closing Date on a per diem basis. Any Taxes for a Straddle
Period  paid prior to the Closing shall be deducted from the Stockholders'
liability  pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and to the extent
in excess  of  the Stockholder's liability, will be refunded to the
Stockholders by Buyer  within 10 days after filing the relevant Tax Return.

 

 

(c) In  the event Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives notice of any
examination,  claim, adjustment, or other proceeding (a " **Proceeding
Notice** ")  with respect to the liability for any Taxes for which the

responsible for any Losses  with respect to the matters referred to in clause
(i) of this Section 10.2(a)  until the cumulative aggregate amount of all
such Losses exceeds the Basket  Amount, in which event the Stockholders shall
then be liable for all Losses  in  excess of the Basket Amount; and (y)
other than for fraud or intentional  misrepresentation or with respect to
Losses based upon, arising out of, asserted  against, resulting from, imposed
on, in connection with, or otherwise in respect  of any misrepresentation or
breach of any of the Specified Cap Representations,  the cumulative aggregate

qualification  (including qualifications indicating accuracy with such

to perform,  any of his, her or its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement  (other than covenants or agreements that require the Stockholders
to cause the  Company to take or not take any action).

 

 

(c) The  Stockholders' Representative agrees that he shall indemnify and hold
harmless  the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses based
upon, arising  out of, asserted against, resulting from, imposed on, in
connection with, or  otherwise in respect of:

10.3 _Indemnification  Procedures_.

 

 

(a) If  any Buyer Indemnified Party, on the one hand, or any Stockholder
Indemnified  Party, on the other hand (the " **Indemnified Party** "), has a
Claim  or receives actual notice of any Claim, or the commencement of any
Claim that  could give rise to an obligation on the part of any the
Stockholders (or, prior  to the Closing, the Company), on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand,  other than a Third Party Claim, to provide
indemnification (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") pursuant to this Article X,
the  Indemnified Party shall promptly give the

Indemnifying  Party (or, in the event one or more Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party,  Stockholders' Representative) notice thereof (the "
**Indemnification Claim  Notice** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give  such prompt notice shall not prevent any Indemnified Party
from being  indemnified hereunder for any Losses, except to the extent that
the failure  to  so promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, actually
materially damages the  Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that during  the five Business Day period following delivery of
an Indemnification Claim  Notice, the Indemnifying Party (or, in the event
one or more Stockholders are  the Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders'
Representative) and the Indemnified  Party shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences they have with respect  to the matters set forth in
such Indemnification Claim Notice (and, after  expiration of such period, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek  any  remedies available to it).

 

 

(b) Upon  receipt by an Indemnified Party of actual notice of a Claim, or the
commencement  of any Claim, by a Third Party (a " **Third Party Claim** ")
that  does or could give rise to an obligation to provide indemnification
pursuant  to  this Article X, the Indemnified Party will give the
Indemnifying Party (or,  in  the event one or more Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders' Representative) prompt written notice
thereof (the " **Third Party  Indemnification Claim Notice** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  the failure of the Indemnified Party to so promptly notify
the Indemnifying  Party (or, in the event one or more Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party,  the  failure to so promptly notify the Stockholders'
Representative) shall not  prevent any Indemnified Party from being
indemnified for any Losses, except  to  the extent that the failure to so
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party (or,  in  the event one or more
Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders' Representative)
actually materially damages the Indemnifying Party or materially  prejudices
the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against such Third Party  Claim.

 

 

(c) Any  Indemnification Claim Notice or Third Party Indemnification Claim
Notice will  describe the Claim in reasonable detail. If the Indemnifying
Party  (or, in the event one or more Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party,
the  Stockholders' Representative) confirms in writing to the Indemnified
Party  within 15 days after receipt of a Third Party Indemnification Claim
Notice  the Indemnifying Party's responsibility to indemnify and hold
harmless the  Indemnified Party therefor and within such 15-day period
demonstrates to the  Indemnified Party's reasonable satisfaction that, as of
such time, the  Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources (taking
into account  the  amount of escrowed funds then held by the Escrow Agent
under the Escrow  Agreement) in order to indemnify for the full amount of any
potential liability  in connection with such Claim, the Indemnifying Party
(or, in the event one  or  more Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, the
Stockholders' Representative)  may elect to assume control over the
compromise or defense of such Third Party  Claim at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party and by counsel selected by the  Indemnifying Party (or, in
the event one or more Stockholders are the  Indemnifying Party, by counsel
selected by the Stockholders' Representative),  which counsel will be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified  Party. If the Indemnifying Party
(or, in the event one or more  Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, the
Stockholders' Representative) so  elects to assume control over the
compromise and defense of such Third Party  Claim, the Indemnifying Party
(or, in the event one or more Stockholders are  the  Indemnifying Party, the
Stockholders' Representative) shall within such  15 days (or sooner, if the
nature of the asserted Third Party Claim so  requires) notify the Indemnified
Party of the agreement of the Indemnifying  Party (or, in the event one or
more Stockholders are the

Indemnifying  Party, of the agreement of the Stockholders' Representative) to
do so, and the  Indemnified Party shall cooperate, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party,  in  the compromise of, or defense against, such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , __ that: __ (i) the Indemnified
Party  may, if such Indemnified Party so desires, employ counsel at such
Indemnified  Party's own expense to assist in the handling (but not control
the defense) of  any Third Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party (or, in
the event one or  more Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, the
Stockholders' Representative)  shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of
all material events with respect  to  any Third Party Claim; (iii) the
Indemnifying Party (or, in the event one  or more Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders' Representative) shall obtain the prior
written approval of the Indemnified  Party  before ceasing to defend against
any Third Party Claim or entering into any  settlement, adjustment or
compromise of such Third Party Claim involving  injunctive or similar
equitable relief being asserted against any Indemnified  Party or any of its
or his Affiliates; and (iv) no Indemnifying Party will  (or, in the event one
or more Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, the  Stockholders'
Representative will not), without the prior written consent of  each
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any 
judgment in any pending or threatened Claim in respect of which
indemnification  may be sought hereunder (whether or not any such Indemnified
Party is a party  to  such action), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent by its terms  obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount
of the liability in  connection with such Third Party Claim and includes an
unconditional release  of  all such Indemnified Parties from all liability
arising out of such Third Party  Claim.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party (or, in the  event one or more Stockholders are the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders' Representative) shall not be entitled
to have sole control over (and if it  so  desires, the Indemnified Party
shall have sole control over) the defense,  settlement, adjustment or
compromise of (but the Indemnifying Party shall  nevertheless be required to
pay all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party  in  connection with such
defense, settlement or compromise): (i) any  Third Party Claim that seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief  against any Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates; (ii) any Third Party  Claim in which both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are named  as parties and either
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party determines  with advice of
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available  to  it that
are different from or additional to those available to the other party  or
that a conflict of interest between such parties may exist in respect 
thereto; (iii) any Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(i) prior to 
such time as the aggregate amount of Buyer's Losses pursuant to such Third
Party  Claim and all prior Claims pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(i) are
reasonably  expected to exceed the Basket Amount (as applicable) or after
such time as  the  aggregate amount of the Losses of Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to such  Third Party Claim and all prior Claims pursuant to
Section 10.2(b)(i) are  reasonably expected to exceed the Cap Amount; and
(iv) any Third Party Claim  relating to Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for periods after the  Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that with respect to any such  Third Party Claim relating to Taxes, the
Stockholders' Representative may  participate in the conduct thereof and
Buyer shall not settle or compromise  such  Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Stockholders' Representative, such  consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

(e) If  the Indemnifying Party (or, in the event one or more Stockholders are
the  Indemnifying Party, the Stockholders' Representative) elects not to
assume the  defense,

settlement,  adjustment or compromise of an asserted liability, fails to
timely and properly  notify the Indemnified Party of his, her or its election
as herein provided,  or,  at any time after assuming such defense, fails to
diligently defend against  such  Third Party Claim in good faith, fails to
have sufficient financial resources  to  pay the full amount of such
potential liability in connection with such Third  Party Claim or if the
Indemnified Party is otherwise entitled pursuant to this  Agreement to have
control over the defense, settlement or compromise of any  Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, pay,  defend,
settle, adjust or compromise such asserted liability (but the  Indemnifying
Party shall nevertheless be required to pay all Losses incurred  by  the
Indemnified Party in connection with such payment, defense, settlement, 
adjustment or compromise). In connection with any defense of a Third  Party
Claim (whether by the Indemnifying Parties, the Stockholders' Representative
or the Indemnified Parties), all of the parties hereto shall,  and  shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in the defense or 
prosecution thereof and to in good faith retain and furnish such records, 
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings,  hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by
a party hereto  in connection therewith.

 

 

10.4 _Set-Off;  etc._

 

 

(a) If  any Indemnified Party becomes entitled to indemnification from an
Indemnifying  Party pursuant to this Agreement, such indemnification payment
will be made  in  cash upon demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Buyer
Indemnified  Party may proceed against the escrow fund held under the Escrow
Agreement in  order to satisfy any such entitlement.

 

 

(b) Buyer  may, at its option (at any time and from time to time), reduce any
amount owed  by Buyer or one of its Affiliates to any Stockholders
Indemnified Party under  this Agreement (whether pursuant to this Article X
or otherwise) or any other  Transaction Document by all or part of any amount
owed by any Stockholders  Indemnified Person to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates under this Agreement  (whether pursuant to this Article X or
otherwise) or any other Transaction  Document.

 

 

(c) Any  payment made by the Stockholders or Buyer pursuant to this Article X
will be  deemed an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

 

 

10.5 _Taxes_ Section  10.3 shall have no application to Losses with respect
to Taxes that are subject  to Section 6.9, which shall be governed
exclusively by Section 6.9, but shall  otherwise apply to Losses resulting
from the misrepresentation or breach as  of  the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date of any representation or warranty  of the Stockholders and
the Company contained in Section 2.7 or of any  representation, warranty or
statement made in any schedule, certificate,  document or instrument
delivered by the Stockholders or the Company in  connection therewith at or
in connection with the Closing, or any third party  allegation or Claim based
upon facts that, if true, would constitute such a  misrepresentation or
breach.

 

 

10.6 _No  Contribution From the Company, Etc._ Notwithstanding anything in
this  Agreement to the contrary: (a) each Stockholder acknowledges and 
agrees that he, she or it does not have any right of indemnification, 
contribution or reimbursement from or remedy against the Company or its 
Subsidiaries as a result of any indemnification he, she or it is required to 
make under or arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of any representation, 
warranty, covenant or

other  obligation contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, document
or other  instrument delivered in connection herewith (including, without
limitation,  any  such breach or inaccuracy of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other  obligation of the Company); and (b) each Stockholder
hereby releases, waives  and  forever discharges any right to
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement  that he or she may have at
any time against the Company or its Subsidiaries  under or arising out of the
breach or inaccuracy of any representation,  warranty, covenant or other
obligation in this Agreement or in any certificate,  document or other
instrument delivered in connection herewith.

 

 

_ARTICLE  XI_

 

 

_MISCELLANEOUS_

 

 

11.1 _Expenses_. Each  of the parties hereto shall pay its own fees and
expenses (including the fees  of  any attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers or others engaged by such party)  in connection with this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents and the  transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (the " **Transaction  Expenses** " ) whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby  are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Stockholders shall  bear all of the Transaction Expenses of the
Company to the extent they are  not  reflected in Closing Working Capital.

 

 

11.2 _Certain  Interpretative Matters_. The captions or Articles and Sections
of  this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect
the  meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this  Agreement. As
used herein, (a) words in the singular shall be  held to include the plural
and vice versa and words of one gender shall be  held  to include the other
gender as the context requires, (b) the terms "hereof," "herein," and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless  otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including  all of the
Schedules and Exhibits) and not to any particular provision of this

are  to the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits, and Schedules to this
Agreement  unless otherwise specified, and (d) unless the context otherwise

"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed  by the words "without limitation". The parties intend that
each  representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have
independent  significance. If any party has breached any representation,
warranty  or covenant contained herein, the fact that there exists another
representation,  warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the  relative levels of specificity) which the party has not
breached shall not  detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in
breach of the first  representation, warranty or covenant, as the case may
be.

 

 

11.3 _Notices_. All  notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be given  in writing and given by certified or registered

binding upon and inure  to  the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs (in the case of  the  Stockholders), successors and
permitted assigns, and the provisions of Article  IX and Section 11.13 hereof
shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnified  Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither this Agreement nor any of  the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the  parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties (except  that Buyer and, upon
the request of Buyer, the Company may collaterally assign,  without the
consent of any other party hereto, all of their respective rights  and
obligations under this Agreement (including their rights under covenants, 
representations, warranties and indemnities) and any other Transaction
Document  to an Affiliate, to any and all lenders or other financing sources
to Buyer,  any  of its Affiliates or the Company or to any Person who
acquires all or  substantially all of any of their properties or assets, any
and all of whom  may  enforce their rights and remedies in connection with
any such assignment or  realization thereon to the extent provided in the
applicable security agreements  and other debt instruments or at law or in
equity. Any purported  assignment or delegation in violation of this
Agreement shall be null and void  _ab_ _initio_.

 

 

11.5 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents  (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto) embodies
the entire  agreement and understanding of the parties and their respective
Affiliates  with  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and merges
in, supersedes and  cancels all prior written or oral commitments,
arrangements or understandings  with respect thereto, including the Letter of
Intent dated May 1, 2007 among  the  Company, Buyer and certain Stockholders
(and it is understood and agreed that  the Confidentiality Agreement dated as
of April 9, 2007 between the Company  and  Buyer shall survive until the
consummation of the Closing). There are  no restrictions, agreements,
promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings  with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby other than those expressly  set forth in
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 

 

11.6 _Modifications,  Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be
modified or  amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed
by the Company  (prior to consummation of the Closing), Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment
to  _Schedule 1.1(b)(i)_ shall also require the written consent of each

behalf of any Stockholder) may, only by an instrument in writing, waive 
compliance by any other party or parties hereto with any term or provision 
hereof on the part of such other party or parties hereto to be performed or 
complied with. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any  right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single  or
partial exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance 
of steps to enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further
exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The waiver
by  any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision hereof shall not
be  construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. The rights and  remedies
of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any  rights
or remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.

 

 

11.7 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in one or more

transmitted by telecopy, telefax or other electronic transmission service
shall  be considered original executed counterparts for purposes of this
Section 11.7,  provided that receipt of copies of such counterparts is
confirmed.

 

 

11.8 _GOVERNING  LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT AND (UNLESS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
THEREIN) EACH  OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT APPLY TO
CONTRACTS MADE  AND PERFORMED ENTIRELY IN SUCH STATE.

 

 

11.9 _Severability_. To  the fullest extent that they may effectively do so
under applicable law, the  parties hereto hereby waive any provision of law
which renders any provision  of  this Agreement invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect. Such  parties further agree that any provision
of this Agreement which,  notwithstanding the preceding sentence, is rendered
or held invalid, illegal  or  unenforceable in any respect in any
jurisdiction shall be ineffective, but  such  ineffectiveness shall be
limited as follows: (a) if such provision is  rendered or held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in such jurisdiction only  as  to a particular
Person or Persons or under any particular circumstance or  circumstances,
such provision shall be ineffective, but only in such  jurisdiction and only
with respect to such particular Person or Persons or  under  such particular
circumstance or circumstances, as the case may be; (b) without  limitation of
clause (a), such provision shall in any event be ineffective  only  as to
such jurisdiction and only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality  or 
unenforceability, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in
such  jurisdiction shall not render invalid, illegal or unenforceable such
provision  in any other jurisdiction; and (c) without limitation of clause
(a) or (b),  such  ineffectiveness shall not render invalid, illegal or
unenforceable this  Agreement or any of the remaining provisions hereof.

 

 

11.10 _Submission  to Jurisdiction; Waiver_ _of Jury Trial_. Each party to
this  Agreement, for himself, herself or itself and his, her or its
Affiliates, hereby  irrevocably and unconditionally:
