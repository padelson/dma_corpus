shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement.

(" _Columbia State Bank_ "), with Columbia State Bank as the surviving bank
(the " _Bank Merger_ ," and together with the Merger, the " _Mergers_ ").

D. The parties intend that the Mergers, taken together, shall be treated as a
single integrated transaction and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

Agreements_ "), each dated as of the date hereof and substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with Parent.

F. As an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, each of the
members of the Company Board of Directors has simultaneously herewith entered
into a Voting and Non-Competition Agreement or Voting and Non-Solicitation
Agreement (collectively, the " _Voting Agreement_ ") or a Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Agreement, each dated as of the date hereof and
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1, B-2 or B-3,
respectively; and

 

G. As an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain officers
of the Company have simultaneously herewith entered into an employment
agreement or amendment to such officers existing employment or severance
agreement, each dated as of the date hereof and substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C-1, C-2, C-3 or C-4, respectively.

 

H. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Washington Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ ") and the Idaho Entity
Transactions Act (the " _IETA_ ") at the Effective Time, the Company shall
merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger and shall continue its existence under the Laws of the State of
Washington. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall cease.

 

(b) Subject to the proviso in Section 8.4, Parent may at any time change the
method of effecting the combination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax
consequences of the Merger to shareholders of the Company or (iii) impede or
delay in any material respect consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, the parties will execute and cause articles of
merger (" _Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Washington (" _Washington Secretary_ ") as provided in Section
23B.11.050 of the WBCA and a statement of merger (" _Statement of Merger_ ")
relating to the Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Idaho (" _Idaho Secretary_ ") as provided in Section 30-18-205 of the
IETA. The Merger shall become effective at such time as such certificates of
merger have been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The
term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective in accordance therewith.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the WBCA and
IETA.

 

1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company or Parent or the shareholders

owned

 



-2-  by shareholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 30-1-1321 of the Idaho Business Corporation Act
(the " _IBCA_ "), to the extent required under Idaho Law (each a "
_Dissenting Share_ " and collectively " _Dissenting Shares_ ", and together
with any Treasury Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to
the provisions of Section 2.1: (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration, (ii) cash in an amount equal to
the Per Share Consideration (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "), or (iii)
a unit consisting of a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Per Share Exchange Ratio and cash equal to the Per Share Cash Amount (such
unit, " _Per Share Mixed Consideration_ ", and together with the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon. At the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent or the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries
(other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) (" _Treasury Shares_ "), and, subject to Section
1.4(i), any Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the Merger and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Warrants_. Pursuant to the Principal Shareholder Support Agreements,
immediately prior to Closing, each warrant to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock, issued by the Company on January 23, 2012 that is then
outstanding and unexercised (each a " _Company Warrant_ ") shall be exchanged
for an amount of cash equal to the product of (a) the Per Share Consideration
less the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock with respect to such
Company Warrant and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of such Company Warrant. Upon such exchange and
in accordance with the terms of the Principal Shareholder Support Agreements,
each Company Warrant shall then be canceled and retired without any conversion
thereof, and no other payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(d) _TARP Warrants_.

 

(i) Prior to Closing, Parent and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate to
negotiate the purchase on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "
_TARP Purchase_ ") from the United States Department of the Treasury (the "
_Treasury Department_ ") of the warrant to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock issued to the Treasury Department on December 19, 2008 (the " _TARP
Warrant_ "). If the TARP Purchase shall have occurred prior to Closing, on the
Closing Date, the TARP Warrant shall be canceled, and no payment or
distribution shall be made in consideration therefor.

 



-3- (ii) If the TARP Purchase shall not have occurred prior to Closing, then on
the Closing Date, the TARP Warrant shall, in accordance with the terms of the
TARP Warrant, cease to represent a warrant to purchase Company Common Stock
and will be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase Parent Common
Stock with such adjustments to the number of Parent Common Stock for which
the warrant is exercisable and the exercise price in accordance with the terms
of the TARP Warrant, and Parent will assume such warrant subject to its terms.

 

(e) _Outstanding Parent Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Parent
Common Stock and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(ii) Each share of Parent Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of
Parent Preferred Stock and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Aggregate Number of Shares_ " means the product of (i) the Per Share
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the Company Diluted Shares.

" _Company Diluted Shares_ " means the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including Company Restricted Stock Awards other than the Forfeited Company
Restricted Stock Awards), excluding shares issuable upon exercise of the
Company Warrants and the TARP Warrants, assuming delivery of cash in respect
of the exercise price thereof.

" _Parent Average Closing Price_ " means the daily closing volume
weighted average price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market (based on "regular way trading") for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days starting on the twenty-fifth (25th) trading day before the
Effective Time.

" _Per Share Cash Amount_ " means $2.2930.

" _Per Share Consideration_ " means the sum rounded to the nearest ten
thousandth of the Per Share Cash Amount and the product of the Per Share
Exchange Ratio and the Parent Average Closing Price.

" _Per Share Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.6426.

" _Per Share Stock Consideration_ " means a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of the Per
Share Consideration divided by the Parent Average Closing Price.

 



-4- (g) _Effect of Conversion_. All of the shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each non-certificated share of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of
fractional shares, into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted pursuant to this
Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c).

(h) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Per Share Exchange Ratio.

 

(i) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(i) No later than ten (10) days following the Closing, to the extent required
under applicable Idaho Law, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
provide each record holder of Company Common Stock who shall have properly
asserted appraisal rights under Section 30-1-1321 of the IBCA with a written
appraisal notice and form pursuant to Section 30-1-1322 of the IBCA.

(ii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the
applicable consideration for such shares set forth in this Agreement, if any,
but the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such
appraisal rights as are granted by the IBCA and the IETA (the " _Idaho Acts_
"). If a holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock under the Idaho Acts shall thereafter
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the
right to appraisal with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, then,
as of the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such share of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed as of the Effective Time to have been
converted into and represent only the right to receive, in accordance with
Section 1.4, the Merger Consideration for such shares set forth in this
Article I.

 

(iii) The Company shall comply in all respects with the provisions of the IBCA
with respect to the Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to the Idaho Acts,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the Idaho Acts and received by the Company in
connection therewith and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to

 



-5-  demands for appraisal under the Idaho Acts. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands without the prior written consent
of Parent.

1.5 _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (A) each award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under any
Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is then
outstanding (other than any Forfeited Company Restricted Stock Awards) shall
become fully vested and non-forfeitable and shall be converted into the right
to receive and shall become exchangeable for the right to receive, at the
election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of
Section 2.1, the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share Cash
Consideration or the Per Share Mixed Consideration (less applicable
withholding and other taxes, if any) and (B) each Forfeited Company Restricted
Stock Award shall be forfeited by the holder thereof and cancelled without
any consideration or payment in respect thereof. The Company shall take all
actions that may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 1.5, including, providing notice of vesting to the holders of Company
Restricted Stock Awards (other than Forfeited Company Restricted Stock Awards)
and obtaining consent from the holders of Forfeited Company Restricted Stock
Awards, in each case to the extent required by the applicable Company Stock
Plan and award agreement under which such Company Restricted Stock Awards
were granted.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Amended
and Restated 2012 Stock Option and Equity Compensation Plan, the 1999 Director
Stock Option Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan, and " _Forfeited Company Restricted Stock Award_ "
means each award of restricted Company Common Stock set forth on Section
1.5(B) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

1.6 _Company Stock Options_. The Company shall take all actions that may be
reasonably necessary or that the Company reasonably considers appropriate to
provide that (A) each holder of an option to purchase Company common stock
granted under any Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") (whether
or not then vested or exercisable) shall be provided with written notice at
least 60 days prior to the Option Termination Date pursuant to which all
outstanding Company Stock Options held by such holder shall become fully
vested and may be exercised by such holder beginning on the date of the
notice through the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing (the "
_Option Termination Date_ ") in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement under which such Company
Stock Options were granted and (B) to the extent that any Company Stock
Option is not so exercised prior to the Option Termination Date, such Company
Stock Options shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without any
consideration or payment in respect thereof.

1.7 _Company Board Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any necessary resolutions
to effectuate the provisions of Sections 1.5 and 1.6.

 



-6- 1.8 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Parent, as amended (the " _Parent
Articles_ "), as then in effect, will be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent (the "
_Parent Bylaws_ "), as then in effect, will be the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.9 _Parent Board of Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall consist of the persons serving on
the Board of Directors of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus
the member of the Board of Directors of the Company selected pursuant to
Section 6.13. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Parent shall
be the officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and such
officers shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

1.10 _Bank Merger_. On the Closing Date and immediately following the
Effective Time, in accordance with the applicable Laws of Washington and the
applicable Laws of Idaho, Panhandle State Bank will be merged with and into
Columbia State Bank in the Bank Merger, with Columbia State Bank surviving
the Bank Merger and continuing its existence under the Laws of the State of
Washington, and the separate corporate existence of Panhandle State Bank
ceasing as of the effective time of the Bank Merger. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the parties shall execute and cause to be filed applicable
articles or certificates of merger and such other documents as are necessary
to make the Bank Merger effective (the " _Bank Merger Certificates_ ")
immediately following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE II

 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Election and Proration Procedures_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause an election statement permitting each holder of Company
Common Stock the ability to elect consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
and subject to 2.1(e) (the " _Election Statement_ ") to be mailed with the
Proxy Statement on the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to each holder
of record of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company
Shareholder Meeting (the " _Record Date_ ").

(b) Subject to allocation in accordance with this Section 2.1(b) and Section
2.1(c), each record holder of Company Common Stock (other than in respect of
Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election
Deadline will be entitled (1) to elect to receive in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock (other than Forfeited Company Restricted Stock Awards)
(A) Per Share Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ "), (B) Per Share Stock
Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ "), or (C) Per Share Mixed Consideration
(a " _Mixed Election_ ", and shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which a Mixed Election is made,

 



-7-  collectively, " _Mixed Election Shares_ ") or (2) to indicate that such
record holder has no preference as to the receipt of Per Share Cash
Consideration, Per Share Stock Consideration or Per Share Mixed Consideration
for each such share (a " _Non-Election_ "). Shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which a Non-Election is made (including shares with respect
of which such an election is deemed to have been made pursuant to this Section
2.1) (collectively, " _Non-Election Shares_") will be deemed to be, in whole
or in part, shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Mixed
Election has been made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each Mixed Election Share and each Non-Election Share shall be, as
of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Mixed
Consideration.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and in addition
to the last sentence of Section 2.1(b), the rights of holders of Company
Common Stock to make elections in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
will be subject to the following principles of allocation:

 

(i) _Number of Stock Elections Less Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If
after application of Section 2.1(b) with respect to Mixed Elections and Non-
Elections the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect
to which Stock Elections are made (collectively, " _Stock Election Shares_ ")
is less than an amount equal to the quotient of (x)(I) the Aggregate Number
of Shares less (II) the product of the Per Share Exchange Ratio and the
aggregate number of Mixed Election Shares and Non-Election Shares, divided by
(y) the Per Share Stock Consideration (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ "),
then:

(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the shares of Company Common
Stock with respect to which a Cash Election is made (collectively, " _Cash
Election Shares_ "), other than Cash Election Shares representing Dissenting
Shares, pro rata to the holders of such Cash Election Shares in accordance
with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of
Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of all
Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion
Number, and each such allocated Cash Election Share (each, a " _Converted
Cash Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

 

(C) each Cash Election Share that is not a Converted Cash Election Share will
be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration.

 



-8- (ii) _Number of Stock Elections Greater Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If
after application of Section 2.1(b) with respect to Mixed Elections and Non-
Elections, the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares is greater than the
Stock Conversion Number, then:

 

(A) each Cash Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares pro
rata to the holders of such Stock Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock
Election Shares (each, a " _Converted Stock Election Share_ ") so that the
difference of (1) the number of Stock Election Shares minus (2) the number of
the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock
Conversion Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration; and

(C) each other Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election
Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 

(iii) _Number of Stock Elections is Equal to the Stock Conversion Number_. If
after application of Section 2.1(b) with respect to Mixed Elections and Non-
Elections, the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares is equal to the Stock
Conversion Number, then:

 

(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

(B) each Cash Election Share and Non-Election Share will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration.

(d) Parent shall make available one or more Election Statements as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and
Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(e) To be effective, an Election Statement must be properly completed, signed
and submitted to the Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the later of the date of the Company Shareholder
Meeting and the date that the parties believe to be as near as practicable to
five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or such other
time and date as the

 



-9-  Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "). Any
Election Statement may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Statement at or prior to the Election Deadline. Upon any such
revocation, unless a duly completed Election Statement is thereafter submitted
prior to the Election Deadline and otherwise in accordance with this Section,
such shares shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Statement, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Statements, and any good faith decisions of Parent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Statement. To the extent the holder of Dissenting Shares submits an
Election Statement, such holders election shall have no effect, the Exchange
Agent will disregard such Election Statement, and the Dissenting Shares shall
be converted in accordance with Section 1.4(i).

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable proration processes consistent with the foregoing
and as shall be determined in good faith by Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to Company.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall (a) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent,
which Person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to
an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the
Effective Time, shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.4(a), and an amount in cash to make the payments pursuant to Section 1.4(a),
plus, (B) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (such amount in cash and Parent
Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

2.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (" _Exchanged Shares_ "), along
with, in each case, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s))) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

 



-10- (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder
of Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after such surrender
in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary practice, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the
Exchanged Shares represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall represent
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without
interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to, this Article II.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby,
in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article
II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are not registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash
Consideration plus any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange
therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares formerly representing such Exchanged Shares shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar
taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination
of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Exchanged Shares such amounts as the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law, with respect

 



-11-  to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Exchanged Shares in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Warrants that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of such Company Common Stock or
Company Warrants that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company as of the one (1) year anniversary of
the Effective Time will be transferred to Parent. In such event, any former
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares, and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such

 



-12-  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

No representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article III (other
than the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2, 3.8 and 3.11(d),
which shall be true and correct in all respects with respect to it) shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect, and the Company shall not be deemed to have
breached any representation or warranty, in each case for all purposes
hereunder, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact,
circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or
taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with
such representation or warranty contained in Article III, would cause the
representation or warranty not to be true in all material respects. Subject to
the foregoing, except as Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) _Organization_. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Idaho. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary. The Company is duly registered as a
bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (" _BHC Act_
").

(b) _Articles and Bylaws._ True, complete and correct copies of the Articles
of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Articles_ "), and the Bylaws
of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been publicly filed by the Company and made
available to Parent. The Company Articles and Company Bylaws made available to
Parent are in full force and effect.

(c)  _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes any Subsidiaries of such Subsidiaries), the ownership interest
of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of
any other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary (other than Intermountain
Statutory Trust I and Intermountain Statutory Trust II), and a description of
the business of each Subsidiary (or, in the case of

 



-13-  a Subsidiary that the Company considers to be "inactive," a statement to
that effect and a description of the business previously conducted by such
Subsidiary). Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly incorporated or duly
formed, as applicable to each such Subsidiary, and validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (ii) has
the requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary. There are no restrictions on
the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or distributions
to the Company, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated
entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all such regulated entities. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the BHC Act,
except that when such term is used with respect to an entity that is not a
bank holding company, the meaning shall nonetheless be deemed to apply to such
entity. The deposit accounts of each of its Subsidiaries that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened. True, complete and correct copies of the articles
of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary
of the Company as in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement
have been provided to Parent. Other than the Subsidiaries of the Company, the
Company does not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own any equity
securities or similar interests of any entity or any interests of any entity
or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 41,000,000 shares

hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been accrued on the

_Multiple Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer

Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA.

 

(g) There does not exist, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates following the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has
engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212

as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at
no expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time
all plans or arrangements providing for post-retirement welfare benefits.

 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there are no pending or threatened
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted, threatened or instituted,
or to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of circumstances exists which may
reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit against the Employee Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee
Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary
correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect
that would qualify for correction under any such program. No audit or other
proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
and associated Treasury Department guidance has been operated in compliance
with, and is in documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS
regulations and guidance thereunder. No compensation payable by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has been reportable as nonqualified deferred
compensation in the gross income of any individual or entity, and subject to
an additional tax, as a result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code
and no arrangement exists with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan that would result in income inclusion under Section 409A(b) of the Code.

 

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or together with any
other event or events, will (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, golden parachute, forgiveness of indebtedness or
otherwise) becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan, whether or not
such payment is contingent, (ii) increase any payments or benefits otherwise
payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits including, but not
limited to, the acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of any equity
awards, whether or not contingent, (iv) result in any limitation on the right
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan or related
trust, (v) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle or (vi)
limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation, to

 



-25-  merge, amend or terminate any of the Employee Benefit Plans. There is no
agreement, contract or arrangement to which the Company is a party that could,
individually or collectively, result in the payment of any amount that would
not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code, as determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code. Except as set forth on Section
3.11(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no Employee Benefit Plan
provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A
of the Code, or otherwise.

(l) Each individual who renders services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other non-
employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax
reporting and under Employee Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized.

3.12  _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company knows of no
reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not
be obtained on a timely basis.

3.13 _Opinion_. The Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion
of Sandler ONeill + Partners, LP that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the

Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

3.14 _Company Information_. The information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by the Company or its representatives for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4, or in any application,

Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the
Proxy Statement relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and other

there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to result in any claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There
is no outstanding injunction, order, writ, award, judgment, settlement,

paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith) and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such
licenses, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened in writing, except
in each case where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or
authorization, such fees or assessments or such suspensions or cancellations
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied with, and are not in default or violation of any, applicable Law
relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

4.10 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no reason
why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis.

 

4.11 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or in any application, notification
or other document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The portions of the
Proxy Statement relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries and other portions
within the reasonable control of Parent and its Subsidiaries will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. The Form S-4 will comply in all material respects
with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 



-44- 4.12 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no suit, action, investigation, claim,
proceeding or review pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against or affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the current or
former directors or executive officers of it or any of its Subsidiaries and
there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
result in any claims against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is no outstanding injunction, order,
writ, award, judgment, settlement, arbitration ruling, decree or regulatory
restriction imposed upon or entered into by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
the assets of it or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

4.13 _Accounting and Internal Controls_.

(a) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom). Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain
internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could
have a material effect on its financial statements. Parent has designed and
implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

 

(b) Parents management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Parent has previously disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee
of its board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal
controls over financial reporting.

 



-45- (c) Since January 1, 2012, (A) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had
or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
written claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or written claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
it or any of its officers or directors to its board of directors or
any committee thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

4.14 _Related Party Transactions_. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no transactions or series of related transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings, nor are there any currently proposed
transactions or series of related transactions, between Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director or
executive officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5%
or more of the Parent Common Stock (or any of such persons immediate family
members or Affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of Parent) on the other hand,
that are required to be disclosed in a proxy statement pursuant to Section 14
of the Exchange Act and are not so disclosed.

 

4.15 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this
Article IV, Neither Parent nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and Parent hereby disclaim any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, Neither Parent nor other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty to the Company or any of its affiliates or
representatives with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget or prospect information relating to Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or (ii) except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent in this Article IV, any oral or
written information presented to the Company or any of its affiliates or
representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of Parent,

contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person
has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to the
Company

 



-46-  whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Company
in Article III hereof, including any implied representation or warranty as to
the accuracy available to Parent or any of its representatives. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent acknowledges that no
representations or warranties are made with respect to any projections,
forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect information that may have been made
available to Parent or any of its representatives.

August 22, 2014, and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement and a prospectus will
be included. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and the Company
shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders.
Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities Law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

(b) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
possible, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals, and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make all initial requisite regulatory filings on or before August 15, 2014
and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (other than any
notice to the Federal Reserve under its regulations, which will be filed in
accordance with the timing contemplated by such regulations). The Company and
Parent shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws, all the non-confidential information relating to the Company
or Parent (excluding any confidential financial information relating to
individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to,
any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations (collectively
the " _Approvals_ ") of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary
or advisable to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to such Approvals and
the completion of the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall consult with
the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

 



-52- (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4
will, at the time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto,
if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
(ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Companys meeting of
its shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, as applicable.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following
the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or restriction
is to be taken or implemented), to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
(measured on a scale relative to the Company), a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or materially restrict or impose a material burden on Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
with respect to the business or operation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such
party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval may be materially delayed.

 



-53- 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees to cooperate with the other
and use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable on its part under this Agreement or under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof. 

6.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of
Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Laws or
federal or state banking Laws (other than reports or documents that the
Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law), (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request and (iii) access to the necessary information (including
the Companys own good faith estimates as available and third-party reports,
if any, commissioned by the Company at Parents request) in order to prepare a
good faith estimate of the potential impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code with respect to amounts potentially payable to senior executives of the
Company in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall
furnish such reasonable information about it and its business as
is reasonably relevant to the Company and its shareholders in connection with
the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent
such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration to the
existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between
the parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. In addition to the foregoing, on an every other week
basis, the Company shall provide Parent with a listing of all new and renewed
loans and loan modifications, loan payoffs and loan purchases in
the preceding two weeks.

(b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the parties dated April 3, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect or
be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants of
the other party set forth in this Agreement.

 



-54- 6.4 _Shareholder Approval_. The Company agrees to take, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the Form S-4
is declared effective), a special meeting or meetings of its shareholders
duly called and held for such purposes (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ")
to consider and to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section
6.9(b)-(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall at all times prior to
and during such special meeting recommend such approval and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit such approval by its shareholders (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, unless this Agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms,
this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the Companys shareholders
at the Company Shareholder Meeting whether or not (x) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have effected an Adverse Change of Recommendation or (y)
any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or
announced or otherwise submitted to the Company or any of its advisors. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the prior
written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder
Meeting (A) if on the date on which the Company Shareholder Meeting is
originally scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company shall adjourn the Company Shareholder
Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10)
days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together
with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval, (B) after
consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company
Shareholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement, or (C) after consultation with the Company, for a
single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days, to solicit additional
proxies if necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Parent may
require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Shareholder
Meeting once for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days (but prior
to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date) to
solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall
not change such record date or establish a different record date for the
Company Shareholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Articles or the
Company Bylaws.

6.5  _Nasdaq Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall file with
Nasdaq any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

 



-55- 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who is actively
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") while employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time with: (i) base salary no less favorable than the
base salary provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than employee benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated
employees of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that until such time as Parent
shall cause Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit plans of
Parent, a Continuing Employees continued participation in the Employee
Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this
sentence (it being understood that participation in Parent benefit plans may
commence at different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan).
Accordingly, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that from the
Closing Date through the next open enrollment date for Parents group health,
dental, vision and life insurance plans, the Continuing Employees shall
continue to be covered by the Companys group health, dental, vision and life
insurance plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall terminate,
effective as of the Effective Time, its plans and programs with respect to
long term care and health savings accounts.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, maintain without amendment the severance policy of Company and its
Subsidiaries applicable to Continuing Employees as of the date hereof (the "
_Company Severance Plan_ ") and provide each Continuing Employee who is not
party to an individual employment, severance or change of control agreement at
the time of his or her termination of employment whose employment is
terminated (other than under circumstances that constitute a termination for
"cause") with the severance payments and/or benefits, if any, to which the
Continuing Employee would have been entitled under the Company Severance Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account the Continuing
Employees length of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided
in Section 6.6(b).

 

(b) Upon Continuing Employees enrollment in Parents employee benefit plans,
such Continuing Employees will, consistent with the provisions of Section
6.6(a) above, become participants in all Parents employee benefit plans,
practices, and policies on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated
employees of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior
service credit for each of Continuing Employees service with the Company,
except as expressly provided otherwise herein, shall be given by Parent with
respect to all Parents retirement plans, employee benefit plans, practices,
and policies to the extent that such crediting of service does not result in
duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits under any defined
benefit. If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in any
Parent employee benefit plan, practice, or policy that provides medical,
hospitalization or dental

 



-56-  benefits, Parent shall (A) use commercially reasonably best efforts to cause
any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under
such Parent benefit plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
their health plans applicable to Continuing Employees, deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan on or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, Parent shall assume the written agreements of Continuing
Employees, on the one hand, and the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, as set forth in Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) If requested in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Parent
to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any Employee Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. 

(e) From and after the date hereof, prior to making any written or oral
communications to officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or other employment-related
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, independent contractor or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee Benefit Plan,
Parent Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan,
Parent Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii)
confer upon any current or former employee, independent contractor or other
service provider any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), or constitute
or create an employment or other agreement with any employee, independent
contractor or other service provider.

 



-57- 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent they are
indemnified on the date hereof, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will provide directors and
officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse
the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (providing only for
the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also
include Side B coverage for the Company) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as
that coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the
aggregate for such six (6)-year period, an amount in excess of 150% of the
aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for any
such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance called for by this Section
6.7, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 150%
of the current annual premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and
directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the Surviving Corporations
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance. Prior to
the Effective Time and in lieu of the foregoing, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy for
directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in the
prior sentence and fully pay for such policy prior to the Effective Time, at
an aggregate cost up to, but not exceeding 150% of the current annual premium
for such insurance.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.7(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation
thereof; provided that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.7(a) unless and to
the extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation is actually and
materially prejudiced as a consequence.

 



-58- 6.8 _Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

6.9  _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company agrees that none of it or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective officers, directors and employees will, and will cause its
and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, representatives, advisors
and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any Company
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort to attempt or make or
implement a Company Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time after the date hereof and prior to, but not after, obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide
Company Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or is reasonably expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Board of Directors may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes
in good faith (and based on the advice of outside legal counsel) that failure
to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that prior to providing
any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso or engaging in any negotiations, it shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less restrictive
in the aggregate to the counterparty than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and which expressly permits the Company to comply
with its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9. Subject to the foregoing
and Section 6.9(c) below, the Company will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject
to applicable Law, to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any Person (other than Parent and
its affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. The
Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise
Parent following receipt of any 

 



-59-  Company Acquisition Proposal, any discussions or negotiations are sought to
be initiated or continued or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal
and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent promptly apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of any such request, inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal, or
all amendments or proposed amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being
understood that for the avoidance of doubt that no such communications to
Parent shall be deemed an Adverse Change of Recommendation). The Company
agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any confidential or
nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
may be provided to any other Person in connection with any Company
Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to Parent.

(c) (i) None of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall: (A) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance
with, Section 6.9(c)(ii)(B) hereof, make any Adverse Change of Recommendation;
or (B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.9(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.9(b)
relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal made to the Company.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if the
Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_
that:

(A) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (and based
on the advice of outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions
would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

 

(B) the Company provides Parent prior written notice at least five (5)
Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the
Board of Directors of the Company has received a Company Superior Proposal
and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to effect an Adverse Change of
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), as
applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for such Adverse Change of
Recommendation or termination, including the material terms of the
Company Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being
understood for the avoidance of doubt that such Notice of Superior Proposal
shall not be deemed an Adverse Change of Recommendation);

 



-60- (C) during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company negotiates in
good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to
enable Parent to make an improved offer that is at least as favorable to the
shareholders of the Company so that such Company Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and

(D) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period (or such earlier time that
Parent advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to amend
this Agreement), the Board of Directors of the Company, after taking into
account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed
to by Parent after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action
pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. As used in
this Agreement, " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange
offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner more than 24.9% of the voting power in, or more than
24.9% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any public announcement of a proposed
plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreements to engage in
any of the foregoing, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary
course. As used in this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means an
unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to be reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into
account all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Law, and
after taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
agreed to by Parent; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Company Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 24.9%" in the
definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

 



-61- 6.10 _Takeover Laws_. No party will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge
the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Laws becomes applicable to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, the
parties shall take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

6.11 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
hereof, the Company will furnish to Parent, (a) consolidated financial
statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations
and stockholders equity) of it or any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent
available) as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management
reports showing actual financial performance against plan, and (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, any reports provided to its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and
risk management of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to a failure of a condition in Article VII.

 

6.13 _Parent s Board of Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parents
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall recommend to Parents
Board of Directors one Person from the Board of Directors of the Company to

as of June 30, 2014 through the Effective Time, with personal connections to
the local civic and business community of the Company, and shall have
qualified as an "independent" director of Parent under applicable
Nasdaq rules and otherwise meet any qualifications under Parents Bylaws and
applicable Laws. Upon approval of such Person by Parents Board of Directors,
such director shall be invited to join the Boards of Directors of Parent and
Columbia State Bank effective as of the Effective Time. Such director shall
be entitled to compensation, indemnification and expense reimbursement in
connection with his or her role as a director to the same extent as other
directors on such Boards of Director of Parent and Columbia State Bank. Upon
Closing or promptly thereafter, Columbia State Bank shall form an advisory
board and invite members of the Companys Board of Directors as shall be
mutually agreed between Parent and the Company to join such advisory board on
further terms and conditions to be determined by Columbia State Bank prior to
Closing.

governing indentures and/or applicable governing documentation and subject to
and contingent upon regulatory approval.

(a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) the
consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (in such form and content as mutually agreed by the
parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of
such third parties to effect a smooth transition in accordance with the
parties timetable at or after the Effective Time. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent in minimizing the extent to which any contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are a party will continue in effect
following the Effective Time, in addition to complying with the prohibitions
in Section 5.2.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.15(a), the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing
and other processing support or outside contractors to assist Parent in
performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion
of the data and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to Parents production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure
that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective
Time) mutually agreed by the parties, subject to any applicable Laws,

be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary
business activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

to the termination of the Companys obligations from the agreements set forth
in Section 6.15(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

best efforts to facilitate the TARP Purchase. The Company shall provide, and

agreement with the U.S. Treasury as may be necessary to effect the TARP
Purchase and as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall make all
determinations with respect to the price proposed for the TARP Purchase. Prior

on Parent or the Company, in each case required to consummate the
transactions 

 



-65-  contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger,
shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all
statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired (all such

registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations shall contain any
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

Company at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
Effective Time (except that representations and warranties that by their
terms speak specifically as of the date of this Agreement or another date
shall be true and correct as of such date); provided, however, that no
representation or warranty of Parent (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in (i) Section 4.2(a), which shall be true and correct
except to a de minimis extent (relative to Section 4.2(a) taken as a whole),
(ii) Sections 4.1(a), 4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.7, which shall be true and correct
in all material respects, and (iii) Section 4.8, which shall be true and
correct in all respects) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes
hereunder as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance
inconsistent with such representation or warranty, unless such fact, event or
circumstance, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or
circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty of Parent has
had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent; provided, further, that for purposes of determining whether a
representation or warranty is true and correct for purposes of this Section
7.3(a), any qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality
(including the terms "material," "materially," "in all material respects,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar terms or phrases) in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded; and the Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to the foregoing effect.

material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer or the
Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

(c) _Regulatory Approvals_. All Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall have been
obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting
periods in respect thereof shall have expired.

a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

breach, either individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by such
party, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be,
and which is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the
party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured
within such time period (provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein);

 

(iv) _No Company Shareholder Approval_  if the Company Shareholder Approval

therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the

Agreement, in each case in a manner that caused the failure to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting, or at any

-68- (e) _Parent Average Closing Price Decline_  By Company, by written notice to
Parent on the Business Day immediately following the Determination Date,
effective as of the date that is three (3) Business Days following the date of
such written notice, in the event that:

proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of
this Agreement and the Determination Date); and

(ii) The number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by
$26.2041 (the " _Closing Price Change Ratio_ ") is less than the number
obtained by (a) dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price (the
" _Index Change Ratio_ ") and then (b) subtracting 0.175.

 

If Company elects to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and provides
such written notice to Parent, then within two (2) Business Days following
Parents receipt of such notice, Parent may elect by written notice to Company
to adjust the Merger Consideration by increasing the Per Share Cash Amount
dollar for dollar by the Pricing Differential. If Parent makes such election
to increase the Cash Consideration, no termination will occur pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) and this Agreement will remain in effect according to its terms
(except as the Per Share Cash Amount has been increased).

 

For purposes of this Section 8.1(e), the following terms have the meanings
indicated below:

 

" _Determination Date_ " means the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately prior
to the Effective Date.

" _Determination Period_ " means the period beginning on the day that is
twenty (20) consecutive trading days prior to the Determination Date and
ending on the Determination Date.

" _Final Index Price_ " means the average closing price of the KBW Regional
Banking Index as quoted on Bloomberg.com (KRX:IND) during the Determination
Period.

 

" _Initial Index Price_ " means $76.75, which is the twenty (20) day average
closing price of the KBW Regional Banking Index as quoted on Bloomberg.com
(KRX:IND) ended on July 18, 2014.

" _Pricing Differential_ " means the amount of the difference between (A)
$13.8920 and (B) the Per Share Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Average
Closing Price.

 



-69- 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the Company, Parent, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement,
or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
that (i) Sections 6.3(b), 8.2, 8.3, and 9.3 through 9.11 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) neither the Company nor Parent shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
knowing breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of the
Company, shall include the loss to the Companys shareholders of the economic
benefits of the Merger).

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement) shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3(b).

 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) (Company Superior Proposal) or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(c) (No Company Recommendation), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee,
in immediately available funds, in the amount of $5,500,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer to an account specified by Parent
promptly, but in any event prior to or concurrently with a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or no later than two (2) Business Days after the
date of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c).

 

(ii) In the event that any Person shall have made a Company Acquisition
Proposal, which proposal has been publicly announced, disclosed or proposed
and not withdrawn, and:

(1) thereafter this Agreement is terminated:

 

(a) by either party pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) (Delay), or Section
8.1(b)(iv) (No Company Shareholder Approval); or

(b) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) (Breach); and

 

(2) within twelve (12) months after such termination of this Agreement, a
Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated or any definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
entered into (provided that for

 



-70-  purposes of the foregoing, the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.9(d) except that the
references to "more than 24.9%" in the definition of Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer to an account specified by Parent prior to the earlier of the
execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of,
such Company Acquisition Proposal. In no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) _Liquidated Damages_. The Company and Parent acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement. The amounts
payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in
the event of termination of this Agreement under such applicable section. In
the event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable under
this Section 8.3, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs
and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount,
and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for
the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
such shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions
and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency

 



-73-  determines that any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Washington, without
giving effect to its principles of conflicts of Laws. The parties hereto agree
that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,

hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from
present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each
party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

 

9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy that may arise under this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, is likely to involve complicated and
difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in

relating to, this Agreement or any documents referred to in this Agreement, or

nor Parent shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to,
or otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic information to a
third party, concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or
disclosure by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement, statement or disclosure by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by Law or by the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq.

 

9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
each of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except for Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are
entitled at Law or equity.

9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. 

(a) Before entry into this Agreement, the Company delivered to Parent a
schedule (a " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") which sets forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Article III or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means
information set forth by the Company in the applicable paragraph of the
Company

 



-75-  Disclosure Schedule or any other paragraph of its Company Disclosure
Schedule (so long as it is reasonably clear from the context that the
disclosure in such other paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).

__[ _REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK_ ] __

 



-76- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by
