those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or
such other date, time or place as is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. One (1) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article

respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later
time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein

be in compliance with  _Section 5.8_) the certificate of incorporation and

_Section 5.8_).

ARTICLE II __

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.6_, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and the Dissenting Shares),
together with the associated Company Rights, shall thereupon be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive from
Parent an amount in cash equal to $0.72, without interest, and subject to any
withholding in accordance with _Section 2.3(g)_ (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the 

 



3  Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by
certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_ without
interest (subject to any withholding in accordance with _Section 2.3(g)_).

 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, or the Company, each outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Warrants_ ")
shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such
canceled Company Warrant shall, upon surrender of such canceled Company
Warrant, be entitled to receive from Parent, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Warrant and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash (without interest, and subject to any withholding in accordance with
_Section 2.3(g)_) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time, __multiplied by__ (ii) the Merger Consideration
(such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Warrant Consideration_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, any such canceled Company Warrant shall no
longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle
such holder to the payment of the Warrant Consideration. Promptly following
the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than the date on which the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders), the Company
shall deliver written notice, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, to
each holder of a Company Warrant, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Warrant, informing such holders of the effect of the
Merger on the Company Warrants. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such notice prior to delivery of such
notice to the holders of Company Warrants. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all necessary actions to permit the cancelling and exchange
of the Company Warrants contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 2.2_.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the purpose of making payment of the Merger Consideration and, subject
to _Section 2.3(h)_, the Warrant Consideration to holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Warrants, respectively, and enter into an agreement,
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with the Paying Agent relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent a
cash amount in immediate available funds sufficient for the Paying Agent to
make all of the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_ and, subject to
_Section 2.3(h)_, _Section 2.2_ (such cash amount, the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent
solely in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America or
(ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest. Any interest and other income from such investments shall become
part of the Exchange Fund held by the Paying Agent for purposes of paying the
Merger

 



4  Consideration and, subject to _Section 2.3(h)_, the Warrant Consideration.
No investment by the Paying Agent of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent or
the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_ and
Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_. No investment
by the Paying Agent of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the
Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.3(h)_, Parent agrees to make available
to the Paying Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash to pay the
Merger Consideration and the Warrant Consideration as contemplated by this
_Article II_ without interest.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, subject to any withholding Taxes in accordance with
_Section 2.3(g)_, the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share
of Company Common Stock surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.3_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_.
The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
upon the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article
II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry

 



5  Shares that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_
, and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article
II_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration or Warrant
Consideration, that may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock
or Company Warrant held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration
or Warrant Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts are
required to be deducted and withheld from such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the applicable taxing authority,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



6 (h) _Alternative Payment Procedure for Company Warrants_. Prior to the
Closing, the parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith and
consult with the Paying Agent and the Warrant Agent for Company Warrants
regarding the payment procedure for Company Warrants. Following such
consultation and if mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, the parties
may use the Warrant Agent to process payment of the Warrant Consideration to
holders of Company Warrants, in which case Parent shall, at or prior to the
Effective Time, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Warrant
Agent (rather than the Paying Agent) a cash amount in immediate available
funds sufficient to pay the Warrant Consideration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3_.

 

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding

entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "

entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the

withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn

Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
_Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon and less any withholding Taxes in
accordance with _Section 2.3(g)_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt

") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not
then vested or exercisable) shall at the Effective Time automatically (and
without any further action being required on the part of the holders thereof)
be canceled and terminated at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to any applicable
withholding in accordance with _Section 2.3(g)_) equal to the product of (x)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective

 



7  Time, __multiplied by__ (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
__over__ the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that if
the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan that is subject to specified vesting criteria (each, a share of "
_Restricted Stock_ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
treated in accordance with _Section 2.1_. In addition to any other
withholding rights of the Company, any withholding Taxes arising from such
vesting may be withheld from the consideration otherwise payable with respect
to such shares pursuant to _Section 2.3(g)_.

 

(c) Each restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into a vested right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration (without
interest, and subject to any withholding in accordance with  _Section
2.3(g)_) and shall be paid in accordance with the award agreement governing
such Company RSU.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions
to permit the treatment of the Company Options, Restricted Stock and Company
RSUs contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.5_. No later
than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the payment
obligations under this _Section 2.5_. All payments required under this
_Section 2.5_ shall be made by the Surviving Corporation to the individual
recipients through its payroll processing system as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing.

 

Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the (a) aggregate
number of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, (b) aggregate
number of shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon the exercise of
any Company Warrants or Company Options, or (c) number of Company RSUs
outstanding shall occur as a result of (i) any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, (ii) any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, or (iii) any issuance of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock upon the exercise or exchange of Company Rights following a
Triggering Event (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement), then the amount
of the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so that the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration payable by Parent to all security holders of
the Company pursuant to this _Article II_ (including the Company Warrants,
Company Options, Restricted Stock and Company RSUs) is not affected by any
such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.6_

of Company Common Stock shall be issued under the ESPP after the date hereof.

possible material violation of any Law applicable to their businesses,
operations, properties or assets.

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 3.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and are in
compliance with, all material licenses, franchises, permits, certificates,
approvals, restrictions and other authorizations (" _Permits_ ") from
Governmental Authorities required by Law or otherwise necessary or advisable
for the conduct of their respective businesses and operations as they are now
being conducted or the ownership or use of their respective properties and
assets (collectively, with all pending applications therefor and amendments,
modifications and renewals thereof, " _Company Permits_ ") (other than those
Company Permits under Environmental Laws, which are governed exclusively by
_Section 3.12_); other than any failure to hold or be in compliance with a
Company Permit that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions or be material to the operation of the Companys business. There
has occurred no violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under or, to the Knowledge of the Company, Event, that with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any revocation, non-
renewal, adverse modification or cancellation of, any Company Permit, other
than any such violations, defaults or Events that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions or adversely affect the
operation of the Companys business in any material respect, nor would any
such revocation, non-renewal, adverse modification or cancellation result from
the consummation of the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice or other written communication from
any Governmental Authority that any Company Permit will be terminated or
adversely modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and the Company has no Knowledge of any
reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or non-renewal.

(b) _Section 3.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
following information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries: (i) a
materially correct description of the amount of any unused and unexpired net
operating losses, unused and unexpired investment or other credits, unused and
unexpired foreign Tax credits and excess charitable contributions of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for federal income Tax, applicable state
income tax, and alternative minimum Tax purposes (including dates of
expiration of such items for each of such purposes) as of December 31, 2013
and, utilizing reasonable assumptions given the fact that such information is
not determined as of the closing of a taxable year, as of September 30, 2014
(assuming (x) the taxable year of the Company ended on such date but
allocating deductions computed on an annual basis such as depreciation

 



18  and amortization pro rata based on the number of days in the current taxable
year prior to such date divided by 365 and (y) such other items as are set
forth on _Section 3.9(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) (A)
the date of each ownership change (as defined in Section 382(g)(1) of the
Code) experienced by the Company that could have an effect on the ability to
utilize the items described in clause (i), (B) the consolidated section 382
limitation (as defined in Section 382(b)(1) of the Code) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as a result of each such ownership change, and (C) the
amount, if any, of consolidated net unrealized built-in gain (as defined in
Section 382(h)(3) of the Code) of the Company on the date of each ownership
change, and (iii) a materially correct description of the Tax basis in the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the aggregate, and of the
assets comprising the Transferred Assets (other than any shipping containers),
in each case for federal income Tax purposes as of December 31, 2013 and,
utilizing reasonable assumptions given the fact that such information is not
determined as of the closing of a taxable year, as of September 30, 2014
(assuming (x) the taxable year of the Company ended on such date but taking
into account deductions such as depreciation in the manner provided above
and (y) such other items as are set forth on _Section 3.9(b)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). Other than the effect on such net operating
losses and basis of (w) ordinary course business operations for the period
from and after January 1, 2014, (x) amortization and depreciation of asset
Tax basis under applicable Law for such period (assuming amortization and
depreciation computed on an annual basis is prorated on a daily basis as
described above), (y) transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement or (z) such items set forth on
_Section 3.9(b)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no
material change in the items listed in clause (i) and clause (iii) of this
_Section 3.9(b)_ since December 31, 2013, other than changes taken into
account in arriving at the estimate of tax attributes as of September 30, 2014
referred to in clause (i) above. To the Knowledge of the Company, since May
3, 2012, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has undergone an
ownership change under Section 382 and/or Section 383 of the Code (or any
comparable provisions of state, local and foreign Law). The depreciation and
amortization amounts and years reflected on _Section 3.9(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule under the heading "Non-Hawaii Depreciation and
Amortization Rollout as of December 31, 2013" reflects in all material
respects the amount of depreciation and amortization of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than assets attributable to the Hawaii
Business) owned as of the date to which such schedule speaks that would be
claimed during each year beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31,
2019, utilizing reasonable assumptions given the fact that such information is
forward-looking, assuming (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries continue to
hold such assets in the ordinary course during such period, (y) that such
assets do not become worthless during such period and (z) such items as are
disclosed on _Section 3.9(b)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) " _Taxes_ " shall mean all (x)
federal, state, local or foreign taxes, charges, fees, imposts, levies or
other assessments, including but not limited to all income, alternative
minimum, gross receipts, capital, sales, use, ad valorem, value added,

whatsoever and all interest, penalties, fines, additions to tax or additional
amounts imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection

 



19  with any of the foregoing, and (y) liability in respect of any items
described in clause (x) above payable pursuant to Contract (other than a
commercial Contract, a principal purpose of which is not the allocation or
sharing of any Tax), assumption, successor or transferee liability, or
operation of law, including Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law); and (ii) " _Tax Returns_ " shall mean any
return, report, claim for refund, election, certificate, estimate, information
return or statement or other similar document relating to, or filed or
submitted or required to be filed or submitted with any Governmental Authority
with respect to, Taxes, including any schedule, attachment or supplement
thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

 

Section 3.10 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of all material Company Plans (the " _Disclosed
Company Plans_ "). The Company has made available to Parent, to the extent
applicable, current, correct and complete copies of (i) each Disclosed Company
Plan, (ii) the three most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be
filed with the IRS with respect to each Company Plan (if any such report was
required), (iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company
Plan for which such summary plan description is required (together with any
summary of material modifications, if applicable), (iv) each trust agreement
and insurance or group annuity contract relating to any Company Plan, and (v)
all material documents and written correspondence relating to each Company
Plan received from or provided to the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the IRS or any other Governmental Authority
since January 1, 2012.

 

(b) Each Company Plan has been established, maintained, funded and
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and
in compliance in form and in operation with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Actions (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course) with respect to, or any Liens filed against or with
respect to, any Company Plans, other than claims made in the ordinary course
of business which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material. All
contributions required to be made by the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been timely made in compliance with applicable Law with respect to all Company
Plans, and there are no material unfunded obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan that are not accurately reflected in
the Companys financial statements and accrued in accordance with GAAP.

(c) All Company Plans, other than any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) that are "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that are intended to be Tax qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Company Pension Plan_ ") have received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS on which the Company may currently
rely, or has filed a timely application therefor. The Company has made
available to Parent a correct and complete copy of the most recent
determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as
well as a correct and complete copy of each pending application for a
determination letter, if any. To the Knowledge of the Company, no fact exists
or Event has occurred since the date of such letter or letters from the IRS
that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of the qualified
status of any such Company Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

 



20 (d) Except as set forth on _Section 3.10(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any trade or business, whether
or not incorporated, that together with the Company would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (including any entity
that during the past six (6) years was a Subsidiary of the Company) (each
such entity, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has now or at any time within the
previous six (6) years contributed to, sponsored, or maintained a
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a plan subject
to section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or section 412 of the Code. The Company
and each ERISA Affiliate have satisfied the minimum funding standards under
Section 412 or Section 430 of the Code or Section 302 or Section 303 of
ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal
liability with respect to a complete or partial withdrawal from any Company
Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA). No Company Plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as such
term is defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Section 3.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions will not, either alone or in combination with another
Event, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) entitle any current
or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company
to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment from the
Company or any of its Affiliates under any Company Plan, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or
otherwise enhance any benefit due any such employee, officer, director or
consultant, or (iii) otherwise trigger any material obligations or penalties
under, breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, any Company Plan (other than any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA)). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company is in material breach of or material default under the terms of any
Company Plan. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company
Plan is in material breach of or material default under the terms of any
Company Plan.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
Contract, arrangement or plan (including any Company Plan) that has resulted
or would result, separately or in the aggregate, in connection with the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other Events), in the
payment of any "excess parachute payments" to any "disqualified individual",
in each case within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. There is no
Contract, plan or other arrangement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party which provides for a gross-up in respect of taxes or
other penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

(g) All premiums or other payments that are required to be paid have been
timely paid with respect to each such Company Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, whether or not such
Company Plan is subject to ERISA) or are accurately accrued and reflected in
the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Except as
set forth on _Section 3.10(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Company Plan provides health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured),
with respect to current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service,
other than health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the
Code, the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee or
director.

 



21 (h) No fiduciary or party in interest of any Company Plan has participated in,
engaged in or been a party to any transaction that is prohibited under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 408 of ERISA, respectively, or has otherwise acted
or failed to act with respect to any Company Plan in a manner, in either
case, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any material liability under ERISA or any other applicable
Law.

 

(i) With respect to each Company Plan that is not subject exclusively to
United States Law (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required by applicable
Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or pursuant to any other
contractual obligation (including contributions to all mandatory provident
fund schemes) have been timely made in accordance with applicable Law or
accurately accrued and reflected on the Companys financial statements in
accordance with GAAP; (ii) from and after the Closing, such funds, accruals
or reserves under the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans shall be used exclusively to
satisfy benefit obligations accrued under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plans or else
shall remain or revert to Parent and its Affiliates in accordance with the
terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan or applicable Law; and (iii) each
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

 

(j) For each Company Plan which is a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, the Company has complied in all material
respects with the notice and continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
as amended, and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations
thereunder.

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any legally
binding plan or commitment to create any additional Company Plans or modify
or change any existing Company Plans that would affect any employee or
terminated employee of the Company or any employee or terminated employee
providing services to the Company.

Schedule or with respect to any Company Plan (which subject is addressed in
_Section 3.10_ above), the execution of this Agreement and the consummation

Section 4.14 _Investigation and Reliance; No Other Representations or
Warranties_.

 

(a) Parent is a sophisticated purchaser and has made its own independent
investigation, review and analysis regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Transactions, which investigation, review and analysis were conducted
by Parent together with expert advisors, including legal counsel, that it has
engaged for such purpose. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that, to
the Knowledge of Parent, it and its Representatives have received access to
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than the Transferred Assets, the
Transferred Liabilities or the Acquired Entities, which it and its
Representatives have desired or requested to review, and that it and its
Representatives have had an opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company, other than the
Transferred Assets, the Transferred Liabilities or the Acquired Entities.

(b) Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information (including any due diligence materials made
available in the data room, in connection with management presentations, or
in other form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent and its
Representatives except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ , and
neither the Company, its Representatives, nor any other Person shall be
subject to any liability to Parent or any other Person resulting from the
Companys making available to Parent, or Parents use of, such information.
Parent has not relied and is not relying on any statement, representation or
warranty, oral or written, express or implied (including any representation or
warranty as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose), made by
the Company or its Representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article
III_ , all of which terminate at the Closing. Parent acknowledges and agrees
that the representations and warranties in _Article III_ are the result of
arms length negotiations between sophisticated parties and such
representations and warranties are made, and Parent is relying on such
representations and warranties, solely for the purposes of

 



35   _Section 6.2(a)_ hereof and acknowledges that the representations and
warranties in _Article III_ expire at the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty regarding any
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as any forward-looking business plan information, regarding the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations. Parent, on its behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives, acknowledges that Parent
and its Affiliates are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, other forward-looking information and forward-looking
business plan information furnished to them by the Company and its
Representatives (including the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions),
and expressly waives any and all claims relating to such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, and such business
plans. Parent has no Knowledge or reason or reason to believe that any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company are untrue, incomplete or
inaccurate as of the date hereof.

(including the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting, proxy statement and

Representatives become aware of any information, facts or circumstances
relating to the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such party shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto so that the Company may file with
the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably possible after the SEC confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, in accordance with
applicable Law and

 



41  the Company Charter Documents, duly call and give notice of, and convene and
hold, a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and such other matters as may be then legally required (including
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay or
postpone convening the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) with the consent of
Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of
votes as may be necessary in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.

(c) The Company shall, through the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof), but subject to the right of the Company Board to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_, (i)
recommend to its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and, unless there has been a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use all reasonable lawful
action to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall provide
Parent with such information with respect to the solicitation of the Company
Stockholder Approval as is reasonably requested by Parent. 

Section 5.3 No _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and
other Representatives to, immediately cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person or group of Persons with respect to any
Alternative Proposal and (ii) until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date (if any) on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and employees and other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, (B)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to
notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_)
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public material
information in connection with, any Alternative Proposal, or (C) enter into
any Contract or agreement in principle with respect to an Alternative
Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives
receives an Alternative Proposal, the Company, the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) and their Representatives may engage in
negotiations and discussions with, or furnish any information and other
access to, any Person making such Alternative Proposal and any of its
Representatives (including potential sources of financing) if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal and financial advisors, that such Alternative

 



42  Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that prior to furnishing any material non-public information to
any such Person, the Company receives from the Person making such Alternative
Proposal an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Upon the receipt of any such
Alternative Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing,
provide Parent a copy of any such Alternative Proposal made in writing and
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and communicate in writing
the material terms of such Alternative Proposal to Parent. The Company will

material negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal.

Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) take any action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a temporary

14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, in each case, that includes reaffirmation of
the Company Board Recommendation and a reaffirmation of the approval by the
Company Board of this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions, or (D)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, to the
stockholders of the Company an Alternative Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar definitive Contract providing for an Alternative Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ only if (i) the Company Board (or
a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company provides Parent prior written
notice of its intent to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking such
action, which notice shall include the material terms of the Superior
Proposal, the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies
of any proposed transaction Contracts and related material documents with
respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it
being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in itself be
deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that any material revision
or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice
and, in such case, all references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section
5.3(d)_ shall be deemed to refer to three (3) Business Days instead); (iii)
during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company
negotiates, and causes its legal counsel and financial advisors to negotiate,
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith and, if agreed between the
Company and Parent, to make such modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal

 



43  would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; (iv) Parent has not, within
such four (4) Business Day period, made a written, binding and irrevocable
offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (v) the Company Board, after taking
into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, continues to believe, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. 

(e) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 5.3(e)_, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the

Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation

to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , that neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the applicable requirements of _Section 5.3(d)_ shall have been
satisfied.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ written Alternative Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock from a financial point of view than the Transaction, taking into
account, to the extent applicable, the legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in accordance with _Section
5.3(d)_) that the Company Board considers relevant.

Governmental Authority; (iii) vigorously resist and contest any Action,
including any Antitrust Proceeding, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed

avenues of administrative and judicial appeal; and (iv) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, and fully
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment
of any fee, penalty or other consideration or make any other concession,
waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection with obtaining any
consent without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act, if applicable, with respect to the Transactions
as soon as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after
the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree to a different date), (B)
supply as soon as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or pursuant to any
civil investigation demand, subpoena or similar request from the
Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice, and (C) use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with
this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions
thereof) as soon as practicable and (ii) each party agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions consistent
with this _Section 5.4_ as necessary to obtain any other necessary Permit or
other actions or nonactions from each Governmental Authority as soon as
practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, obligations relating to "reasonable
best efforts" and "as soon as practicable" in this _Section 5.4_ shall,
among other things, mean using reasonable best efforts to be prepared to
complete a certification of compliance with any request for additional
information issued by the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission
in connection with the Transactions (" _Second Request_ ") as soon as
practicable.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable
Laws and reasonable guidance from each partys antitrust counsel relating to
the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall each have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with
the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws, the instructions of any Governmental Authority
and reasonable guidance from each partys antitrust counsel relating to the
exchange

 



45  of information, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions and the Precedent Transaction, including promptly informing the
other of, and/or furnishing the other with copies of, notices or other
material communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental
Authority and/or third party with respect to such transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including 
_Section 5.1(b)_, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to
require, Parent or Merger Sub to agree to or effect (i) any direct or indirect
sale, charter (in whole or any portion), lease, change or limitation
in operation, divestiture, license, holding separate or other disposition of
any Vessel (whether or not acquired hereunder); (ii) any action that would
reasonably be expected to impair the value of the Transactions to Parent in
any material respect; or (iii) any action that would reasonably be expected
to have any adverse effect on Parents (or any of its Subsidiaries) existing
assets or businesses as conducted as of the date of this Agreement or as of
the Closing Date. 

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. In addition, the Company
shall not approve or issue and release any press release with respect to the
Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement without the prior
written approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Following such initial press release(s), Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions and/or the Precedent Transaction
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after as much advance notice and
consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.5_ shall not apply to any release or public
statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with
an Alternative Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto or (b) in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal announcements to their
respective employees and other stockholders that are not inconsistent in any
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Notification of Certain
Matters_. 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, financial statements, forecasts and other financial data, Tax Returns,
Contracts, litigation files and other records and the Company shall furnish
promptly such other documents and

 



46  information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties as Parent and its Representatives may reasonably request, which
shall include, without limitation, in-person meetings and conference calls
between operational and functional business unit personnel of Parent and the
Company, as reasonably requested by Parent, to prepare and make arrangements
for Closing and post-Closing matters; _provided_ , that Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment after consultation with outside
counsel, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
have no obligation to provide access for, and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates or Representatives shall have the right to perform, any sampling or
analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials, effluent, indoor air or
other environmental media commonly known as Phase II environmental assessment
work. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to
the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of December 27,
2013, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Company shall not, and Parent and Company shall
cause their respective Representatives not to, use such information for any
purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. No investigation
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_ or information provided, made available or
delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

(b) Until the Closing, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other
in writing of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any
other substantive notice or communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, (iii) any Action commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the
Transactions, or (iv) any Event, fact, change, condition, circumstance or
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any Event (A) that (x) with respect to any
representation or warranty that is qualified as to materiality, Non-Hawaii
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality qualification
contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (y) with
respect to any representation or warranty that is not qualified as to
materiality, Non-Hawaii Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, renders or would reasonably be expected to render any
representation or warranty of such party set forth in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (B) that results or would
reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such party to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or Contract
(including any condition set forth in _Article VI_ ) to be complied with or
satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_ or information provided shall affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or

 



47  remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.
Without limiting the foregoing, five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with (x) an updated _Section 3.16(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule setting forth any and all Contracts that, as of
the date of such supplement, would have been required to be set forth on
_Section 3.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule had the date of this
Agreement been the date of such supplement and (y) updated _Sections 3.2(a)_
and _(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule setting forth such information
that, as of the date of such supplement, would have been required to be set
forth on _Sections 3.2(a)_ and _(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule had
the date of this Agreement been the date of such supplement. Such supplement
shall not be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty made
in this Agreement or have any effect for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ or the compliance
by the Company with any covenant set forth herein (other than this _Section
5.6_). Each party acknowledges and agrees that the failure to notify the other
party of any breach of a representation or warranty or to provide the
disclosure supplement pursuant to this  _Section 5.6(b)_ on its own shall be
treated only as a breach of the applicable representation or warranty for
purposes of _Article VI_ and not a breach of a covenant or obligation in this
_Section 5.6(b)_.

 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each (a)
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and
(b) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to the
Transactions, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
current and former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
any actual or threatened Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative) (each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to their
position with the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in
whole or in part to the Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of
liability, exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as
provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary Charter
Documents, if applicable, listed on  _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (B) any indemnification agreements listed on _Section 5.8_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule with an Indemnitee, which shall in each case
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after
the Effective Time until six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving

 



48  Corporation to include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors
and officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnitees no less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the
Company Charter Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except
as required by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the coverage
provided by the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time either through the Companys existing insurance provider or
another provider reasonably selected by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_
, _however_ , that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the
Company may purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the
aggregate amount which the Surviving Corporation would be permitted to spend
during the six-year period provided for in this _Section 5.8(b)_, that
provides coverage no materially less favorable than the coverage described
above.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.8_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this  _Section 5.8_ applies unless (A)
such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 5.8_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.8_).

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in, and review and comment on all material filings
or responses to be made by the Company in, the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company or any of its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Contribution,
Assumption and Purchase Agreement, and no such settlement of any stockholder
litigation shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any

 



49  settlement which (a) does not include full release of Parent and each of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
any of its Affiliates), (b) imposes any restriction, injunction or other
equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and any of its Affiliates), or (c)
involves anything other than the payment of monetary damages and attorneys
fees not to exceed $5,000,000 individually or in the aggregate. Each of Parent
and the Company shall notify the other promptly (and in any event within
forty-eight (48) hours) of the commencement of any such stockholder
litigation of which it has received notice.

Section 5.10 _Exemption from Section 16_. The Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect
to such equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is or will
be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) This _Section 5.11_ shall apply only to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding
those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are defined as "Hawaii
Employees" (including for the avoidance of doubt, Hawaii Employees of Sea-
Logix or HSI) under the Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement ("
_Company Employees_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , only _Sections 5.11(d)_ ,
_(f)_ and _(g)_ shall apply to Company Employees who are Represented
Employees. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, (i)
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Company Employee, both
(A) annual base salary or base wages, and (B) annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities, that are no less favorable than such compensation
arrangements in effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide other employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (including equity
awards or other forms of long-term incentive compensation) provided to the
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose
employment terminates during the one (1) year period following the Effective
Time with severance benefits at levels no less favorable than and pursuant to
the terms of the Companys current severance policies or, if more favorable,
then as required by applicable local Law.

(b) Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or another of its
Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted
under applicable Law, to provide that for all purposes (including purposes of
vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits but not for
purposes of defined benefit pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans
of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee
after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "),
each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Disclosed Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to

 



50  participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
(or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or another of its Subsidiaries to)
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Disclosed Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Company Employee, Parent (or the Surviving Corporation or another of
Parents Subsidiaries) shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions
were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or another of its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Disclosed
Company Plans to any Company Employee for the period ending at the Effective
Time and any additional period at or after the Effective Time during which
such Disclosed Company Plan remains in effect, and Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control," "change of control," "corporate transaction" or similar term under
each such Disclosed Company Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to each Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement to or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or is bound, each such applicable collective
bargaining agreement (each, a " _Represented Employee_ ") shall govern such
Represented Employees terms and conditions of employment (including
compensation and benefits) for so long as such collective bargaining agreement
remains in effect in accordance with, or as otherwise required by, applicable
Law. 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that each employee listed on _Section
5.11(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have "good reason" (or
other similar term) to terminate employment immediately after the Effective
Time and that any notice requirement or cure provision is hereby waived.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A)
maintain any particular Company Plan or

 



51  any other benefit plan, program or arrangement or (B) retain the employment
of any particular employee for any specified period of time, or (iii) prevent
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company
Plan or any other benefit plan, program or arrangement.

(g) Nothing in this  _Section 5.11_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any
current or former Company Employee, any participant in any Company Plan, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment of
any Person with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates.

 

(h) The Company shall terminate all of its cash bonus and similar cash-based
incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements set forth on _Section
5.11(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Incentive Plans_
") immediately prior to the Effective Time and provide Parent, no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, with a schedule by
individual recipient of any and all payments to be made thereunder based on
(i) for the quarterly bonus, the actual performance for the Companys then
current fiscal quarter through the Effective Time and pro-rated for the
number of days worked in the fiscal quarter during which the Effective Time
occurs and (ii) for the full year bonus (without duplication of the amount
payable pursuant to the preceding clause (i)), the actual performance for
the Companys then current fiscal year through the Effective Time and pro-
rated for the number of days worked in the fiscal year during which the
Effective Time occurs. For avoidance of doubt, any payments are to be made
only to recipients who are Company Employees, and no payments shall be made
in connection with or following the Closing under any Company Incentive Plan
for performance based on any period of time other than the fiscal quarter
during which the Closing occurs. All payments required to be made under the
Company Incentive Plans in connection with this _Section 5.11(h)_ shall be
made as soon as practicable following the Effective Time by the Surviving
Corporation through its payroll processing system.

 

(i) To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, if requested by Parent
prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, such other
Company Plans as Parent requests.

Section 5.12  _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)
cause Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 



52 Section 5.14 _Treatment of Existing Indebtedness_.

 

(a) As part of the Transactions, the Company shall redeem all outstanding
Secured Notes on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Secured Notes
and the applicable Secured Notes Indentures (the " _Redemption_ "). Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with each other in connection with the Redemption. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to effect the Redemption in accordance with
the terms of the Secured Notes Indentures, including, without limitation,
Section 3.01, Section 3.03 and Section 3.05 of each of the Secured
Notes Indentures, and shall send the required notices of redemption in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (collectively, the "
_Redemption Notices_ ") on or before the date specified by Parent in writing,
which date shall be on or after the date of termination or expiration of all
waiting periods applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act. The Redemption
Notices shall provide that Redemption shall occur on the Closing Date but may
be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. Concurrently with the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause, or cause its Subsidiaries to cause,
to be redeemed all outstanding Secured Notes in accordance with the Redemption
Notices and the terms and conditions of the Secured Notes Indentures,
including Section 3.07 of each of the Secured Notes Indentures. On the Closing
Date substantially contemporaneously with the Redemption, all Liens securing
Indebtedness related to the Secured Notes shall be released pursuant
to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to Parent.

(b) As part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall, on or before the date specified by Parent in writing (which
date shall be at least thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof),
commence a tender offer and Consent Solicitation for all of the outstanding
Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture
(the " _Tender Offer_ "). The purchase price offered to holders of the
Convertible Notes in the Tender Offer shall be 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and the
Tender Offer shall contain the other terms and conditions set forth in
_Section 5.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(i) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with the Tender
Offer. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent or its
Representatives shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Tender Offer, any related letters of transmittal, notice
and other related documents (collectively, the " _Debt Offering Documents_ ")
and such documents shall be compliant with the terms of the Convertible Notes
Indenture and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the Debt Offering Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Convertible
Notes in connection with the Tender Offer shall be subject to the prior review
and comment by each of the Company and Parent and/or their Representatives,
and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The consummation of the
Tender Offer will not be a condition to the Closing. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Debt Offering Documents so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any

 



53  material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and/or disseminated to the respective holders of the Convertible
Notes (subject to this _Section 5.14(b)_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.14(b)_, the Company shall comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law
to the extent such Law is applicable in connection with the Tender Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this
_Section 5.14(b)_, the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall
not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such compliance.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Consent Solicitation_ " shall mean a
solicitation of the Requested Consents from the holders of the Convertible
Notes, and " _Requested Consents_ " shall mean the consents of holders of the
specified percentage in principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the
amendments to the Convertible Notes Indenture as described in _Section
5.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Promptly upon the receipt of the
Requested Consents with respect to the Convertible Notes Indenture, the
Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture reflecting the amendments to
such indenture approved by such Requested Consents and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the trustee for the Convertible Notes to promptly enter
into such supplemental indenture (including using its reasonable best efforts
to deliver, and to cause its counsel to deliver, any required certificates and
opinions of counsel that will be reasonably required by the trustee in
connection with such supplemental indenture). Neither the receipt of the
Requested Consents nor the execution of the supplemental indenture referred to
in the preceding sentence shall be a condition to the Closing.

 

(iii) The Companys and the Surviving Corporations obligation to accept for
payment and pay for the Convertible Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender
Offer shall be subject to the conditions that (x) the Merger shall have
occurred (or Parent and the Company shall each be satisfied that the Closing
will occur substantially concurrently with such acceptance and payment and/or
exchange), (y) there shall be no Order prohibiting the consummation of the
Tender Offer, and (z) such other conditions as are customary for transactions
similar to the Tender Offer.

 

(iv) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and any dealer-manager under
any dealer-manager agreement for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and

Release Documents):

(i) Mortgage Release Documents in recordable form and
appropriate documentation releasing any recorded Liens on the Vessels;

(ii) payoff letters to effect the full repayment and discharge of the Company

clause (a) of the definition thereof), such Company Credit Facility and
related notes, guaranties, security agreements and other instruments
supporting the repayment of such Company Credit Facility shall be terminated
(except for obligations that by the terms of such Company Credit Facility
survive such termination), and (C) stating that all Liens on the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing the obligations under such Company

and the Secured Notes referred to in clause (a) of the definition thereof),
released;

(iii) Lien release documentation with respect to the Company Credit

to each of the Non-Hawaii Vessels with respect to which a mortgage was filed
securing the obligations under such Secured Indebtedness, in recordable form,
(B) a UCC termination statement for any financing statement filed in
connection with such Indebtedness, and (C) unconditional releases of any
other Liens granted pursuant to the terms of such Indebtedness or pursuant to
any document executed and delivered in connection with such Indebtedness,
including in respect of any cash collateral or other accounts held by the
lenders of such Indebtedness (it being understood that such satisfactions, UCC
termination statements and releases shall be conditioned on receipt of the
applicable Payoff Amounts described in _Section 5.14(c)(ii)_ above and the
redemption of the applicable Secured Notes, as the case may be);

(iv) termination amendments with respect to any financing statements filed in
connection with the foregoing Secured Indebtedness with respect to equity
interests of Companys Subsidiaries, in each case in customary form and

55 (d) On the Closing Date, upon payment by Parent of funds equal to amount of
the relevant Payoff Amount, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (x) apply such funds to pay in full the Payoff Amount with
respect to each Company Credit Facility in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Payoff Letter (or direct the payment of a portion of the Payoff
Amount to be transferred by wire transfer directly to the agent for such
Company Credit Facility or otherwise in accordance with the applicable Payoff
Letter) and (y) use reasonable best efforts to take all other necessary
actions to facilitate and effect the termination and release of all Liens on
the Companys assets and the assets of the Companys Subsidiaries securing the
obligations under Company Credit Facilities, including using reasonable best
efforts to negotiate and obtain the releases with respect to vessel mortgages
and UCC financing statements filed in connection with such Company Credit
Facility described in _Section 5.14(c)_); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to cause such
termination or release unless the Closing shall occur concurrently therewith
and the Company or its Subsidiaries have received funds from Parent to pay in
full the Payoff Amount in connection with each Company Credit Facility (or
the Payoff Amount for each Company Credit Facility shall have been transferred
by wire transfer directly to the agent for such Company Credit Facility or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable Payoff Letter) and, in the case
of the $20M Term Loan, pay in full the debt and other outstanding obligations
owed by the Company and its Subsidiaries under the $75M Term Loan and the
Secured Notes referred to in clause (a) of the definition thereof.

(e) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
Parent (i) duly completed and executed Payoff and Lien Release Documents in
customary form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and (ii) if
required by the trustee for the Convertible Notes, a copy of the opinion of
counsel of the Company addressed to the trustee with respect to the Merger
contemplated by Article V of the Convertible Notes Indenture so long as all
conditions set forth therein have been satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event Parent determines not to effect the Closing on the basis of the
failure of the Company to deliver the documents required to be delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.14(e)_, such determination
shall not constitute a breach by Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement and shall not entitle the Company to recover any Losses or
seek specific performance under _Section 8.9_. The parties further agree that
if the Company fails to deliver any of the documents required to be delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.14(e)_, then the Closing
shall be delayed up to ten (10) days until the Company makes such deliveries.
The failure to deliver any of the documents contemplated by the first sentence
of this  _Section 5.14(e)_ shall not constitute a breach by the Company of
its obligations under this Agreement and shall not entitle Parent to recover
any Losses or seek specific performance under _Section 8.9_; _provided_ that
the Company has complied with _Section 5.14(c)_ above. In the event Parent
fails to give effect to the Closing solely on the basis that the lenders of
any Secured Indebtedness would not release the Liens on the Companys assets
upon receipt of full repayment of such Secured Indebtedness, such failure
shall not itself constitute a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their
obligations in this Agreement and shall not entitle the Company to seek
specific performance under  _Section 8.9_.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, (i) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
Representatives shall be permitted to purchase or offer or commit to purchase
all or any portion of the Convertible Notes and (ii) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to purchase or offer or commit to purchase
all or any portion of the Convertible Notes (including pursuant to the Tender
Offer) for consideration in the aggregate not in excess of $2,000,000.

 



56 (g) In the event that the Convertible Notes for any reason remain outstanding
as of the Closing Date, Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection
with the suspension of covenants under the Convertible Notes Indenture and
related security documents, in each case in accordance with the Fifth
Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 11, 2014 to the Convertible Notes
Indenture.

 

Section 5.15 _Company Rights Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to provide that the Final Expiration Date
(as such term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement) shall occur
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any payment being made in
respect thereof.

 

Section 5.16 _Certain Actions_.

 

(a) Each of the actions set forth on _Schedule 5.16(a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ shall
be taken by the applicable parties referred to therein and on or by such
dates as indicated therein, in each case subject to the terms, qualifications
and limitations set forth on the applicable schedule, if any. In addition,
during the period from the date hereof until the Closing, each party shall
comply with its obligations on _Schedule 5.16(a)(iii)_.

(b) At substantially the same time as circulated to management, between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent the
Companys monthly "Financial Package" in a form substantially similar to the
monthly Financial Packages that the Company has previously made available to
Parent; _provided_ , that such monthly Financial Packages shall not include
information regarding the Acquired Hawaii Business.

 

Section 5.17 _Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement_.

 

(a) The Company shall consult with Parent with respect to, and provide Parent
an opportunity to review and comment upon, the Preliminary Closing Statement
(as defined in Section 1.4(a) of the Contribution, Assumption and Purchase
Agreement), and the Company shall consider for inclusion in such statement
comments reasonably proposed by Parent, prior to delivery of the
Preliminary Closing Statement to Pasha. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall keep Parent currently apprised of any differences between the Company
and Pasha with respect to the computation of any of the items in the
Preliminary Closing Statement and the resolution of any such differences.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall perform, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities) to perform, in all
material respects, their respective obligations required to be performed under
the Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub may allege any breach or anticipated breach of
this covenant or seek any remedy or exercise any right (including any remedy
or right under _Section 8.9_) on the basis of any breach or anticipated
breach by the Company of this covenant unless and until the Contribution,
Assumption and Purchase Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms,
and the Companys liabilities under this

 



57  covenant shall be limited to liabilities arising out of any willful and
material breach of the Contribution, Assumption and Purchase Agreement by the
Company. In addition, prior to the Closing, the Company shall not amend,
waive or otherwise expressly modify (or agree to amend, waive or otherwise
expressly modify) any term, provision or requirement of the Contribution,
Assumption and Purchase Agreement in a manner that would or would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the Company in any material respect.

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been
consummated on or before the End Date was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_
, _further_ , that the End Date shall be extended by up to thirty (30) days
(as necessary) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_
shall be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such
party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company Stockholder
Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained; or

terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ and (B)
cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date or, if 

 



61  capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent stating Parents
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_
and the basis for such termination; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ if

(ii) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ and (B)
cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date or, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days
following receipt of written notice from the Company stating the Companys
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_
and the basis for such termination; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any representation,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
closing conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ not being
satisfied; or

 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if, in order to
enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal in accordance with

pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void (other than _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_,
_Article VIII_ and _Section 5.6_, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section 7.3_
(including the limitations on liability contained therein, including _Section

Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and enter into any transaction
that is a Superior Proposal immediately upon payment of the Termination Fee
and those Parent Expenses for which Parent has provided documentation (it
being understood that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the
Company from its obligation to pay the remainder of the Parent Expenses
pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_).

will be satisfied by providing redacted copies of vendors monthly fees and
expenses) for, each Parent Expense within forty-five (45) days after delivery
of Parents notice of termination or Parents receipt of the Companys
termination notice, as applicable. The failure of Parent to provide such
documentation for one or more Parent Expenses shall not affect the Companys
obligation to pay any other Parent Expenses for which Parent has provided such
documentation, and the Company shall pay any such other Parent Expenses as
and when Parent provides such documentation in accordance with this _Section
7.3_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses on more than one (1)
occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions in the event any such payments become due and payable, and,

liability to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives under this Agreement.
