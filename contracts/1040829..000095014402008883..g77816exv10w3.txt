which evidence the nature and source of all Pre-Closing Receipts sufficient to
prepare royalty statements. Buyer will be responsible for the payment of all
royalties to Writers, Artists and Producers and for all sums actually payable to
third-party income participants and holders of Outside Interests which result
from the Pre-Closing Receipts and for Writer advances required by the Songwriter
Agreements, and the Pre-Closing Receipts will be reduced by any amount Sellers
have expended therefor. Buyer recognizes that Sellers may pay royalty advances
to Writers for royalties already received by the Business (but do not anticipate
paying other royalties) and required Writer advances. On the Closing Date,
Sellers shall pay to Buyer the net amount of all Pre-Closing Receipts, net of
the reductions described above, by cashier's check, bank wire transfer or other
form approved by Buyer (the "Pre-Closing Receipt Payment"), and Sellers shall
certify that the Pre-Closing Receipt Payment equals the net amount of all
Pre-Closing Receipts by setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of
receipts, reduced by any royalty payments or other payments to third parties
made by Sellers as permitted hereunder. In addition, as a reimbursement of a
portion of Sellers' expenses incurred in respect of the Business after the
Cut-off Date, Buyer shall pay to Sellers at Closing $40,000 per week (pro-rated
for any partial weeks) beginning on the Cut-off Date and ending on the Closing
Date), limited to eight weeks (not including employee costs relating to
processing of royalty payments for periods prior to and including the Cut-off
Date). At Closing, Sellers shall pay to Buyer $300,000 for cash due to Writers
and third parties for amounts received by the Business prior to the Cut-off Date
in settlement of the MP3 action.

      2.5 THE CLOSING. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Sellers in
Nashville, Tennessee commencing at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the third business
day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of

      2.7 ASSUMED CONTRACTS.

            (a) Assumed Contracts. Buyer shall assume at the Closing, effective
      as of the Effective Date, the obligations of Sellers under all the
      contracts and agreements of Sellers relating to the Business, including
      those listed on Schedule 2.7(a) hereto (the "Assumed Contracts").

            (b) Consents. Each Seller shall promptly request and use its
      reasonable efforts to obtain consent to the assignment to Buyer of
      material Assumed Contracts requiring consent (collectively, the "Contract
      Consents"). If any Contract Consent is not obtained, such Assumed Contract
      shall not be assigned to Buyer. Sellers shall, to the extent practicable,
      keep the relevant Assumed Contract in effect and give Buyer the benefit of
      such Assumed Contract to the same extent as if it had not been excluded
      from the Assets, and Buyer shall perform the obligations under such
      Assumed Contract on behalf of Sellers to the extent that such obligations
      would have existed if such Assumed Contract had been assigned to Buyer. If
      after the Closing Date such Contract Consent is obtained, Buyer shall
      assume such Assumed Contract as of the date of such Contract Consent.
      Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign any
      agreement or other instrument that is by its terms nonassignable without
      the consent of the other party thereto.

      2.8 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. For federal Tax purposes, the Purchase
Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated to the Assets in a manner
to be agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers within sixty (60) days after the Closing
consistent with the Treasury Regulations under Section 1060 of the Code. Sellers
and Buyer further agree to cooperate in preparing and filing Form 8594 to be
filed with the IRS reflecting the agreed-upon allocation and acknowledge and
agree that such allocation was determined by arm's length negotiations and that
none of them will take a position on any Tax Return, before any governmental
agency charged with the collections of any Tax, or in any judicial proceeding,
that is inconsistent with such allocation. Sellers will cooperate with Buyer in
filing an election under Section 338(a) of the Code (a "Section 338 Election")
relating to the acquisition of the shares of the Subsidiaries; provided, that
notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement to the contrary, that (i) all
Taxes that result from the 338 Election shall be paid by the Buyer, and the
threshold set forth in Section 8.6(b) shall not apply, and (ii) Sellers' Tax
liability attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not be greater if such 338 Election is made than if such 338 Election were not
made. Sellers shall have no obligation to cooperate in the filing of an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code.

            (a) Each of the Compositions is an original creation of the Writer
      and protectable under the copyright laws of the United States, is subject
      to protection of the Universal Copyright Convention and the Beme Union,
      where applicable, and does not infringe the copyrights of any musical
      composition or other work the rights to which are owned by any other
      Person. No Composition is defamatory or violates the civil rights of any
      Person or any right of privacy or publicity.

            (b) Each of the Record Assets is the original work of its author
      and, except for Masters first fixed before February 15, 1972, protectable
      under the copyright laws of the United States and does not infringe the
      copyrights of any other works the rights to which are owned by any other
      person.

            (c) To the extent that any Composition or Record Assets was acquired
      from any Person, such Persons have warranted and represented to Sellers
      (and have agreed to indemnify Sellers as a result of any breach of such
      warranty or representation), in writing, that such Compositions or Record
      Assets are original and do not infringe upon any other works or violate
      the rights of any other Person; such representations and warranties,
      indemnities and all underlying agreements are assignable and the benefits
      and enforcement of such representations, warranties, indemnities and
      agreements shall inure to Buyer and its Affiliates hereunder.


                                       22
<PAGE>
            (d) Sellers have not received any notice of infringement or conflict
      with the asserted rights of any other Person in respect of any of the
      Compositions or Record Assets.

            (e) Sellers administer, own or co-own each of the Compositions and
      the Record Assets.

            (f) All of Sellers' and the Subsidiaries' Copyright Interests in the
      Compositions and the Masters are fully assignable.

            (g) At Closing, there will be no Security Interests in, liabilities,
      claims or encumbrances or liens on the Publishing Assets or Record Assets.

            (h) Sellers have not received any material advances for use of the
      Compositions or the Masters before they would otherwise have become due,
      outside of the Ordinary Course of Business.

      4.17 UNRECOUPED ADVANCES TO SELLERS. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.17,
as of the date of such schedule there are no advances paid or payable to Sellers
which are recoupable from or chargeable against income derived from the
Compositions.

      4.18 LIMITATION OF PAYMENTS. The execution hereof and the consummation of
the transaction contemplated hereby shall not cause Buyer to be required to make
any payments of any nature to acquire the Compositions or other Assets except as
specifically provided for in this Agreement, or as set forth on Schedule 4.18.

      4.19 LICENSES AND SUBPUBLISHING AGREEMENTS. Except as so indicated on
Schedule 4.19, none of Sellers has issued any material Licenses in respect of
any of the Publishing Assets which: (a) provide for no consideration to be paid
to Sellers or their assigns; or (b) grant exclusive rights to any user of the
Publishing Assets; or (c) purport to govern all or a substantial number of the
Compositions or, in the case of Sellers or Sellers' Affiliates, purport to
govern a substantial number of their respective Compositions; or (d) was issued
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business. Schedule 4.19(c) constitutes true
and correct copies of all material Subpublishing Agreements to which Sellers or
the Subsidiaries are a party.

      4.20 HISTORICAL NPS AND NRR. The aggregate NPS and NRR for the period
commencing on January 1, 1999 and ending on March 31, 2002 (set forth on
Schedule 4.20 attached hereto) is $27,396,818, and Sellers warrant and represent
that the Compositions and Record Assets generated all of the aggregate NPS and
NRR specified on such Schedule, except as designated on such Schedule. The NPS
and NRR does not include any payments of Gross Revenues which have been
accelerated to a time earlier than the time at which such payment otherwise
would have been made so as to prematurely include such payments in an accounting
period with a view toward distorting the NPS for such period. The books and
records of the Business reflecting the revenues from the Compositions and the
Record Assets for the period beginning January 1, 2002, up to and including the
Closing Date, are and will be complete and correct in all material respects, and
have been and will be prepared on an accrual basis pursuant to GAAP consistently
applied and in the Ordinary Course of Business. The aggregate NPS and NRR set
forth on Schedule 4.20 reflects all revenues earned from the exploitation of the


                                       23
<PAGE>
Compositions and Record Assets as well as all royalties, obligations and
contractual benefits of whatsoever kind or nature which have been paid (or
provided for) to the Writers, holders of any Outside Interest or other Persons
during that period and said statement of aggregate NPS and NRR is true and
accurate in all material respects. There are no revenues reflected on the
statement of aggregate NPS and NRR annexed hereto as Schedule 4.20 (except as
set forth thereon) which were derived from any assets of Sellers, of whatsoever
nature, other than the Compositions and Record Assets.

      4.21 NAMES. Sellers own all rights in and to the Names. Sellers covenant
that, following the Closing Date, neither Sellers nor any successor-in interest
of Sellers, or any Person owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by Sellers
or any successor-in-interest of Sellers, will use any of the Names or any
confusingly similar derivation of the Names in connection with the exploitation
of musical compositions or sound recordings anywhere in the world.

      4.22 TOP 120 SONGS. The Top 120 Songs and/or revenue interests based on
NPS and NRR for the five year and one quarter period ended March 31, 2002
provided during due diligence and listed on Schedule 4.22 (the "Top 120 Songs")
attached hereto represent approximately 62.79 percent of the average annual
aggregate NPS and NRR, net of foreign subpublishers fees, for the period from
January 1, 1999 to March 31, 2002. The figures for Sellers' Publisher's
Copyright Interest, Publisher's Performance Collection Percentage, Publisher's
Performance Retention Percentage, Publisher's Non-performance Collection
Percentage and Publisher's Non-Performance Retention Percentage interest set
forth on such schedule are true and correct in all material respects.

      4.23 RENEWAL RIGHTS. Sellers have acquired the renewal term copyright
rights in and to the Top 120 Songs, except as listed on Schedule 4.23 attached
hereto.

      4.24 NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Sellers have received no notices of
termination of transfers for the Top 120 Songs pursuant to Sections 203(a) and
304(c) of 17 U.S.C., other than notices received from Hank Williams, Jr. with
respect to the extended renewal term of copyright in compositions authored by
his late father, Hiriam "Hank" Williams.

      4.25 SCHEDULE OF COMPOSITIONS AND MASTERS. Schedule 4.25 contains a true
and correct list of all Compositions, including the title, authors, copyright
owner(s) and percentage ownership interests, and Masters. Since January 1, 2001,
there have been no assignments of Compositions or Masters other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

      4.26 SONGWRITER AGREEMENTS. Schedule 4.26 contains true and complete
copies of the Songwriter Agreement or Acquisition Document pursuant to which
Seller acquired its rights in each of the Top 120 Songs.

      4.27 TRADEMARKS AND DOMAIN NAMES. Attached hereto as Schedule 4.27 is a
complete list of registered trademarks, pending patent applications and, to
Sellers' Knowledge, domain names included in the Assets.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may take actions to dividend cash to
Affiliates, or take other corporate actions to convert intercompany receivables
into equity of subsidiaries or owned entities or otherwise pay off or cancel
intercompany accounts prior to Closing. In addition, Sellers may take any and
all actions necessary or advisable in order to convert to limited liability
companies prior to the Closing Date.

upon two business days notice and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of Sellers and the Subsidiaries, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), contracts, and
documents of or pertaining to each of Sellers and the Subsidiaries. Buyer will
treat and hold as such any Confidential Information it receives from Sellers and

Confidentiality Agreement.

      5.6 NOTICE OF DEVELOPMENTS. Sellers will give prompt written notice to
Buyer of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of the

notice to Sellers of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of
Buyer's representations and warranties in Article 3.

      5.7 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. Sellers shall not, and shall not authorize or
permit any of the Subsidiaries or any of their or the Subsidiaries' officers,
directors, employees or agents to, directly or indirectly, solicit, knowingly
encourage, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any non-public information to any Person (other than Buyer or any of
their affiliates or representatives) concerning, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposal or inquiry relating to any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, sale of 10% or more of any of the
Sellers' assets, sale of 10% or more of the shares of capital stock or other

other action and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly all
required consents, approvals, authorizations, exemptions and waivers of the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
shall cooperate with Sellers (including taking all actions requested by Sellers
to cause early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act)
and provide to Sellers such information as Sellers may reasonably require to
make such filings and notifications and prepare such applications required by
the HSR Act. Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer (including taking all actions
requested by Buyer to cause early termination of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act) and provide to Buyer such information as Buyer may reasonably
require to make such filings and notifications and prepare such applications
required by the HSR Act. Buyer shall pay all filing fees of Buyer and Sellers
payable in connection with the filings under the HSR Act.

                                   ARTICLE 6.

      The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the
Closing:

      6.1 GENERAL. In case at any time after the Closing, any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties will
take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the
sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under Article 8). Sellers acknowledge and
agree that from and after the Closing, Buyer will be entitled to possession of
all documents,


                                       26

to the resolution of audit claims, Buyer agrees to resolve such claims

any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior

Parties will cooperate with such Party and such Party's counsel and cause its
Affiliates so to cooperate in the contest or defense, make available their
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their books and records as
shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, at the sole cost
and expense of the contesting or defending Party or Affiliate (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article 8).

      6.3 TRANSITION. Seller will not take any action that is designed or
intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,

      6.5 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS. Buyer agrees to offer employment to at
least 7 employees of Sellers and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date on
terms and at a salary and benefit level commensurate with "Sony/ATV/Nashville"
employment policies. Buyer will consider hiring, on a preferred basis, other of

shall cease participating in Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans, but Sellers shall
be responsible for benefits for periods prior to the Closing Date, subject to
the reimbursement provisions herein.

      6.6 BULK SALES. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers are not complying with the
provisions of the bulk sales or similar laws of any and all states, and Buyer

      8.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All of the representations

      8.2 INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS FOR BENEFIT OF BUYER. In the event Sellers
breach (or in the event any third party alleges facts that, if true, would mean
any Sellers have breached) any representations, warranties, covenants or

to the terms hereof, each Seller jointly and severally agrees to indemnify Buyer
from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences Buyer may suffer

arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach (or the
alleged breach) regardless of when the Adverse Consequences may occur.

      8.3 INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS FOR BENEFIT OF SELLERS. In the event Buyer

                                       29
<PAGE>
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer contained herein,
and provided Sellers issue a Claim Notice within any survival period, then Buyer

entirety of any Adverse Consequences Sellers may suffer through and after the
date of the claim for indemnification resulting from, arising out of, relating
to, in the nature of or caused by the breach (or the alleged breach).

      8.4 PROCEDURE FOR MATTERS INVOLVING THIRD PARTIES.

            (a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified
      Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give
      rise to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the
      "Indemnifying Party") under this Article 8, then the Indemnified Party
      shall promptly issue a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party with respect
      thereto.

            (b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the
      Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
      reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the
      Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within 30
      days following the receipt of the Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party
      will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any
      Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
      arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third
      Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
      Third Party Claim actively and diligently.

            (c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of
      the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (i) the
      Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
      expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
      Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
      into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
      prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
      unreasonably withheld and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to
      the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
      Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
      Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, except the
      Indemnifying Party may consent to the entry of judgment or settlement
      without the consent of the Indemnified Party if the judgment or settlement
      is solely for money damages.

            (d) In the event any of the conditions in Section 8.4(b) is or
      becomes unsatisfied, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
      consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
      respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
      appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain
      any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii)
      the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
      periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
      (including attorneys' fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party
      will remain responsible for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party
      may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of,
      or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this
      Article 8.


                                       30
<PAGE>
            (e) Notice of Claim. A Party suffering Adverse Consequences or a
      Party that determines that any occurrence or claim may result in Adverse
      Consequences that gives or could give rise to a claim for indemnification
      under this Article 8 shall promptly notify each other Party thereof in
      writing (a "Claim Notice") in accordance with Section 11.7. The Claim
      Notice shall contain a brief description of the nature of the Adverse
      Consequences suffered and, if practicable, an aggregate dollar value
      estimate of the Adverse Consequence suffered. No delay in the issuance of
      a Claim Notice shall relieve any Party from any obligation under this
      Article 8, unless and solely to the extent such Party is thereby
      prejudiced.

      8.5 LIMITATIONS ON SELLERS' INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY.

            (a) Ceiling: Sellers' collective aggregate liability for
      indemnification claims under this Article 8 shall not exceed the amount of
      the Purchase Price for Claim Notices delivered until the date that is nine
      months after the Closing Date (the same day of the month) (the "First
      Period"). Sellers' collective aggregate liability for Claim Notices
      delivered from the date that is nine months after until the date that is
      eighteen months after the Closing Date (the same day of the month) (the
      "Second Period") shall not exceed one-half of the Purchase Price, minus
      the dollar amount with respect to Claim Notices delivered during the First
      Period. Sellers' collective aggregate liability for Claim Notices
      delivered from the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date
      until the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Third Period") shall
      not exceed one-fourth of the Purchase Price, minus the dollar amount with
      respect to Claim Notices delivered during the First Period and the Second
      Period.

            (b) Basket/Threshold: No Seller shall have any liability for
      indemnification claims under this Article 8, unless and until the
      aggregate Adverse Consequences claimed under Section 8.2 exceed One
      Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (excluding all Adverse Consequences less than
      Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)) and then only for an amount by
      which such Adverse Consequences exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).
      This threshold does not apply to Writer audit claims in excess of
      $1,000,000 to be paid by Sellers under Section 2.2(a)(iii).

            (c) Period: No indemnification shall be available after the date
      that is three years after the Closing Date, except in respect of Adverse
      Consequences relating to Claim Notices delivered prior to such date.

      8.6 LIMITATIONS ON BUYER'S INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY.

            (a) Ceiling: Buyer's aggregate liability for indemnification claims
      under this Article 8 shall not exceed the amount of the Purchase Price for
      Claim Notices delivered during the First Period. Buyer's aggregate
      liability for Claim Notices delivered during the Second Period shall not
      exceed one-half of the Purchase Price, minus the dollar amount with
      respect to Claim Notices delivered during the First Period. Buyer's
      aggregate liability for Claim Notices delivered during the Third Period
      shall not exceed one-fourth of the Purchase Price minus the dollar amount
      with respect to Claim Notices delivered during the First Period and the
      Second Period; provided that the limit in this


                                       31
<PAGE>
      Section 8.6(a) shall not apply to any failure to close and pay the
      Purchase Price as required hereunder.

            (b) Basket/Threshold: Buyer shall have no liability for
      indemnification claims under this Article 8, unless and until the
      aggregate Adverse Consequences claimed under Section 8.3 exceed One
      Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (excluding all Adverse Consequences less than
      Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)) and then only for an amount by
      which such Adverse Consequences exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);
      except this threshold shall not apply to any failure to close and pay the
      Purchase Price as required hereunder or to pay the Assumed Liabilities.

            (c) Period: No indemnification shall be available after the date
      that is three years after the Closing Date, except in respect of Adverse
      Consequences relating to Claim Notices delivered prior to such date.

      8.7 DETERMINATION OF ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. The Parties shall take into
account the time cost of money (using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate)
and Tax benefits and/or consequences in determining Adverse Consequences for
purposes of this Article 8.

      8.8 BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP BY
SELLERS; DAMAGE CALCULATION. Sellers recognize that Buyer employs unique and
special resources in exploiting the assets Buyer owns or in which Buyer has an
interest and that the purchase price paid by Buyer for the Assets hereunder is
based upon Buyer's determination of the future income Buyer could derive from
the Assets by employing Buyer's unique and special resources. Accordingly, each
party agrees that it is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the
extent of the detriment which would be caused in the event of any material
breach of the warranties or representations of Sellers contained in this
Agreement with respect to the Compositions or Masters or of any interest therein
and the sale, assignment and transfer to Buyer of all of Sellers' right, title
and interest therein as provided for in this Agreement. To avoid the problem of
quantifying damages in any such event, if any of the Compositions or Masters or
any interest therein is not effectively transferred to Buyer by virtue of a
defect in Sellers' title therein or other breach of a warranty or representation
of Sellers contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, failure
to effect transfer resulting from any claim that an Asset or the exploitation
thereof infringes on some other party's rights, provided the claim concerned has
been settled with Sellers' consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, or reduced to final judgment; it being understood that Buyer shall
have no obligation to appeal any adverse judgment), then Sellers and Buyer agree
to fix compensatory damages in an amount equal to the average annual NPS/NRR
attributed to the Compositions or Masters in question (or portion thereof not so
transferred) for the thirteen (13) quarters ending March 31, 2002 (computed by
dividing the total NPS/NRR for such periods by 3.25), multiplied by eighteen
(18). (It is understood that such compensatory damages shall be reduced by the
amount of any income received by Buyer with respect to such Asset after the
Cut-off Date and not paid to a third party, including, without limitation,
songwriters, Artists, other royalty participants or the owner(s) of the work
infringed by such Asset.) Such end product shall, in the absence of fraud,
constitute Buyer's sole compensatory damages for such breach, subject to Section
8.5(b) above.


                                       32

      8.9 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnification provisions in this Article 8 shall be the exclusive
remedy of Buyer if and after the Closing has occurred with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 9.
                                   TAX MATTERS

      9.1 TAX PERIODS.

            (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Cut-off Date. Sellers shall
      prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
      Returns for the Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
      Cut-off Date which are filed after the Cut-off Date. Sellers shall pay or
      cause to be paid when due any and all Taxes due on each such Tax Return.

            (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Cut-off Date.
      Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
      any Tax Returns of the Subsidiaries for all periods which begin before the
      Cut-off Date and end after the Cut-off Date, and shall pay when due the
      Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. Buyer shall permit Sellers to review and
      comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing. Sellers shall indemnify
      Buyer for Taxes paid in respect of such Tax Returns equal to the portion
      of such Taxes that relates to the portion of the taxable period ending on
      the Cut-off Date. For purposes of this Section 9.1(b), in the case of any
      Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax
      period that includes (but does not end on) the Cut-off Date, the portion
      of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
      Cut-off Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
      the relevant Tax period ended on the Cut-off Date. All determinations
      necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
      manner consistent with prior practice of the Subsidiaries.

      9.2 REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. Any Tax refunds of the Subsidiaries that are
received by Buyer and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or the
Subsidiaries and any Subsidiary become entitled that relate to Tax periods of
the Subsidiaries or portions thereof ending on or before the Cut-off Date shall
be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any
such refund or credit and shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount
of any such credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto less the
allocated portion of direct costs incurred.

      9.3 CERTAIN TAXES. Seller and Buyer agree that inasmuch as the Assets
purchased hereunder include substantially all the operating assets of Sellers,
the sale and purchase of the Assets, other than the motor vehicles and the real
property, may be exempt from sales and use taxes or other transfer taxes in the
jurisdictions in which the Assets are located pursuant to the bulk sale or
occasional sale provisions in the applicable statutes in such jurisdictions, and
Buyer and Sellers shall treat the transfer of the Assets provided for herein as
a bulk or occasional sale for all purposes; provided, however, that to the
extent it shall be determined after the date of the Agreement that, through no
fault or misrepresentation on the part of Sellers, the sale by Sellers, and the
purchase by Buyer of all or any portion of the Assets (including the vehicles
and the real


                                       33
<PAGE>
property) is subject to a sale, use or other transfer tax or recording tax, then
such tax shall be paid by Buyer. The parties shall cooperate with each other in
the preparation, execution and filing of any Tax Returns that may be required in
connection with such Taxes and any related filing fees, notarial fees and other
costs.

      9.4 COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS. Sellers, Buyer and the Subsidiaries shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns for the Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request),
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Buyer, Sellers and the Subsidiaries agree to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and to the extent notified
by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority.

      9.5 TAX AUDITS.

            (a) Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
      the Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
      relating to Tax Returns for periods ending prior to the Cut-off Date and
      to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, that, (i) Buyer
      shall be entitled to participate in any such audit or proceeding at its
      own expense, and (ii) Sellers shall not be entitled to settle any claim
      for Taxes that would adversely affect the liability for Taxes of Buyer or
      the Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
      shall not be unreasonably withheld. If any Taxing Authority asserts a
      claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes or affects any Tax for
      which Sellers are responsible hereunder, Buyer shall, promptly upon
      receipt by Buyer or the Subsidiaries of notice thereof, inform Sellers
      thereof.

            (b) Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
      the Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
      relating to Tax Returns for periods ending after the Cut-off Date and to
      employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, that Sellers shall
      be entitled to participate, at their own expense, in any Tax audit or
      administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax Return for any
      period that begins before and ends after the Cut-off Date.

                                  ARTICLE 10.
                                   TERMINATION

      10.1 TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:

            (a) Buyer and Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
      consent at any time prior to the Closing;


                                       34
<PAGE>
            (b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
      Sellers at any time prior to the Closing

                  (i) in the event Sellers have breached any representation,
            warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in any material
            respect, Buyer has notified Sellers of the breach, and the breach
            has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice
            of breach; or

                  (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
            October 31, 2002, by reason of the failure of any condition
            precedent under Section 7.1 (unless the failure results primarily
            from Buyer itself breaching any representation, warranty, or
            covenant contained in this Agreement).

            (c) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
      Buyer at any time prior to the Closing

                  (i) in the event Buyer has breached any representation,
            warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement in any material
            respect, Sellers have notified Buyer of the breach, and the breach
            has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice
            of breach; or

                  (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
            October 31, 2002, by reason of the failure of any condition
            precedent under Section 7.2 (unless the failure results primarily
            from Sellers breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
            contained in this Agreement).

      10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. If any Party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any
other Party (except for any liability of any Party then committing willful
default or willful breach); provided, however, that the confidentiality
provisions contained in Section 5.5 and Section 6.4 shall survive termination.
In the event that Buyer breaches its obligation to close and pay the Purchase
Price pursuant to the terms hereof, Sellers would suffer irreparable damage and
therefore shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. If any Party terminates this
Agreement other than as permitted by Section 10.1, the non-breaching party would
suffer irreparable damage and therefore shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity.

                                  ARTICLE 11.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      11.1 PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. No Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of Buyer
and Sellers; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
determines in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other Parties prior to
making the disclosure).


                                       35

      11.2 NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

      11.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and, except as
provided in Section 6.4, supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or
representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they
relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.

      11.4 SUCCESSION AND ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors

of Buyer and Sellers; provided, however, that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of
its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (b)
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in
any or all of which cases Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder).

      11.5 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
