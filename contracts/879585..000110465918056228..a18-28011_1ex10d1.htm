Project. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fair market value of the
Company Assets as of the Closing Date, and the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to the Sellers beneficial ownership interests in each Tax Equity
Partnership and the portion of the Purchase Price not so allocated to the
Sellers beneficial ownership interests in a Tax Equity Partnership, in each
case for the purposes of determining the tax consequences of the Transactions
(including the application of Section 1060 of the Code to such transactions)
shall be as set forth on a schedule to be prepared and finalized in accordance
with this _Section 2.6_ (the " ** _Allocation Schedule_** "), which shall
employ a valuation methodology to be agreed by the parties (the " **
_Allocation Methodology_** "). Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall prepare a draft Allocation Schedule employing the Allocation
Methodology and deliver such draft Allocation Schedule to the Seller for the
Sellers review. The Seller shall have thirty (30) days thereafter to dispute
such draft Allocation Schedule in accordance with the Allocation Methodology,
with any failure to dispute during this time deemed acceptance of such draft
Allocation Schedule. In the event of any dispute regarding the draft
Allocation Schedule, the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if the Seller and the Buyer are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within
thirty (30) days after the Sellers notification of dispute to the Buyer, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm employing the
Allocation Methodology (with the Buyer and the Seller each bearing fifty
percent (50%) of the associated fees and expenses), which resolution will be
deemed final and binding to the Buyer and

 



      
 

 



 

the Seller. In the event of any adjustment to the purchase consideration
(including any liabilities of the Company Group Entities that are treated as
consideration for Tax purposes), including as a result of any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller
a revised Allocation Schedule prepared in accordance with the Allocation
Methodology reflecting such adjustment. Neither the Seller nor the Buyer will
take a position on any Tax Return, before any Authority, or in any judicial
proceeding that is in any way inconsistent with the Tax treatment set forth
above or the Allocation Schedule (as finalized), unless otherwise required
pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code,
and the Seller and the Buyer shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with such Tax treatment and the Allocation Schedule (as finalized).

 



 

Section 2.7 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) If the Closing Date occurs on or before November 5, 2018, after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall (i) on or before twenty-five (25) Business Days
following the first Calculation Date (as defined in and pursuant to Section
7.1(d) of the Note Purchase Agreement) to occur after the Closing Date, file
the necessary compliance certificates with the Collateral Agent (as defined in
the Note Purchase Agreement) and (ii) on or before the next Business Day after
such Calculation Date, instruct the Collateral Agent (under and as defined in
the Note Purchase Agreement) to pay to the Seller the Cash on Hand
Reimbursement Amount in accordance with the Collateral Agency, Intercreditor
and Account Agreement (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement); _provided_
, that if as a result of circumstances that existed prior to the Closing Date
the conditions to the provision of such compliance certificates are not
satisfied, then the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, at
the sole cost and expense of the Seller and subject to the Sellers full
cooperation, to cause such conditions to be satisfied and to file such
compliance certificates as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

(b) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer will
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller an unaudited
statement (the " ** _Closing Statement_** "), which shall set forth (i) the
Buyers good faith calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment and the Cash
on Hand Adjustment, and (ii) the corresponding calculation of the Purchase
Price, together with reasonable supporting calculations and documentation
therefor. The Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance with the
applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement (including _Exhibit D_).

 



 

(c) Upon receipt from the Buyer, the Seller shall have thirty (30) days to
review the Closing Statement. If the Seller disagrees with the Closing
Statement or any calculation included therein, the Seller may, on or prior to
the last day of such thirty (30)-day period, deliver a notice to the Buyer
(the " ** _Notice of Objection_** "), which sets forth its objection to the
Closing Statement. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or
amounts with which the Seller disagrees and include a detailed explanation of
the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set
forth the Sellers calculation of the disputed amounts based on such
objections. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, the Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed with the Buyers calculation of all items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement. The Buyer shall provide the Seller
and its Representatives with any information reasonably requested by the
Seller and shall give the Seller and its Representatives access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the personnel, properties, books
and records

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company Group Entities (including work papers of accountants and other
advisors, if any) for the purpose of their review of the Closing Statement in
accordance with this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(d) Unless the Seller timely delivers the Notice of Objection to the Buyer,
the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Buyers calculation of all
items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the Closing Statement
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Seller timely
delivers the Notice of Objection to the Buyer, the Buyer and the Seller shall,
during the thirty (30) days following the date of such delivery or any
mutually agreed extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts. If, at the end of such
period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, the Buyer and the Seller are
unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer
their disagreements to a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller (the " ** _Independent
Accounting Firm_** "). If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to so agree,
each shall select a nationally recognized independent accounting firm and
those two firms shall select a third such firm, in which event " **
_Independent Accounting Firm_** " shall mean the third such firm. The Buyer
and the Seller shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm promptly to
review this _Section 2.7_ and to determine, solely with respect to the
disputed items and amounts so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any,
the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. The
Buyer and the Seller shall make available to the Independent Accounting Firm
all relevant books and records and other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after its retention, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a report which sets forth its
resolution of the disputed items and amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Independent Accounting Firm assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by the Seller
or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by the Buyer. The
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. After the Independent Accounting Firms final
determination of the disputed items and amounts, no Party shall have any
further right to make any claims against any other Party in respect of the
Closing Statement or any calculation included therein. The Buyer and the
Seller shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred under this
_Section 2.7_. The Independent Accounting Firm shall allocate its fees, costs
and expenses between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the value of the matters
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.

 



 

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, the Purchase Price, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, whether by acceptance or as a
result of the dispute resolution process set forth herein shall be the " **
_Final Purchase Price_** ". Promptly, and in any event no later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day, after such determination: (i) if the Final Purchase Price
is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, the Buyer will pay such excess
amount to the Seller; and (ii) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, the Seller will pay such deficit amount to the
Buyer. Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_
shall be made by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
recipient of such payment at least one Business Day prior to such payment. Any
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_ shall be treated for Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. As of the Effective Date, the Buyer is not
aware of any obligation to withhold and deduct any Taxes from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement. However, the Buyer
shall be entitled to withhold such amounts as required to the extent any such
withholding is required by applicable Law, _provided_ that the Buyer shall
first give the Seller reasonable prior written notice of its intent to deduct
or withhold any such Taxes, together with an explanation of the basis for such
deduction or withholding. The Buyer shall consider in good faith any proposal
reasonably made by the Seller to mitigate or eliminate such withholding Taxes.
In the event the Buyer has withheld Taxes from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall provide to Seller evidence
that it has remitted such Taxes to the appropriate Authorities to the extent
such evidence is reasonably available or obtainable. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Seller.

liability company validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware, and is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
other jurisdiction where the actions to be performed by it under this
Agreement and the other Seller Documents make such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or licensed would not have a material adverse effect on the Sellers ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Seller
Documents. The Seller has all the requisite limited liability company power
and authority to conduct its business with respect to the ownership of the
Company Interests and the Projects and to own the Company Interests and the
Projects.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Company Existence and Powers_. Each Company Group Entity is a

liability company power and authority to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted. Each Company Group Entity is duly qualified or licensed to do

company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to be executed by it in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, the " ** _Seller Documents_** ") and to perform the obligations

performance of its obligations under the Seller Documents does not require any
qualification, licensing or approval by any foreign jurisdiction. The Seller
has taken all action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
other Seller Documents, as applicable, to consummate the Transactions and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and no other action or

the Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract (other than the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements,
applicable tax equity buyout documents, and customary indemnification or
reimbursement provisions in loans, leases and other commercial agreements no
significant purpose of which is related to Taxes) or otherwise by operation of
Law.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.16(d)_ , no audit or other proceeding
by any Authority is pending, and no Authority has given written notice of any
intention to commence an audit or other proceeding, or assert any deficiency
or claim for additional Taxes against any Company Group Entity. There is no
threatened audit or proposed deficiency for unpaid Taxes with respect to any
Company Group Entity. No written claim (or, to the Sellers Knowledge, a claim
made in person or by telephone by an authorized representative of an
Authority) has ever been made by an Authority in a jurisdiction where a
Company Group Entity does not file Tax Returns that such Company Group Entity
or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. Neither the Seller nor any Company Group Entity (or any
Affiliate or direct or indirect owner of the foregoing) has applied to the IRS
or any state tax authority for any Tax ruling (or any comparable ruling from

Project. No power of attorney has been granted with respect to any Taxes of
any Company Group Entity.

has at all times been properly treated as a disregarded entity for U.S.
federal and state income tax purposes, and no election has been filed with
respect to each such Company Group Entity so as to cause it to be treated as
an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

either a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal and state income
tax purposes, and no election has been filed with respect to each such Tax
Equity Partnership so as to cause it to be treated as an association taxable
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(g) Each Tax Equity Partnership has made a valid election under Section 754 of
the Code.

 



 

(h) Cash Grants were awarded and ITC was claimed with respect to the Projects
as identified on _Schedule 5.16(h)_. There is no fact, circumstance, or
occurrence that would cause the Cash Grant received by any Company Group
Entity to be disallowed, reduced (other than for reason of sequestration),
recaptured, or treated as resulting in income subject to tax as a result of an
excessive Cash Grant award. There is no fact, circumstance, or occurrence that
would cause the ITC claimed with respect to any Project owned by any Tax
Equity Partnership or its Subsidiaries to be disallowed, reduced, or
recaptured. Neither the Seller nor any Company Group Entity has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant in the Tax Equity Documents. No part of
the assets, property or equipment of any Company Group Entity is tax-exempt
use property within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code or subject to
the alternative depreciation system within the meaning of Section 168(g) of
the Code. There is no fact, circumstance, or occurrence that would cause the
federal income tax depreciation deductions of any Tax Equity Partnership to be
disallowed or deferred.

Section 6.1 _Corporate Existence and Powers_. The Buyer is a limited liability
company validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, and has all the requisite limited liability company power and
authority to conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own,
lease and operate its assets.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Authority_. The Buyer has all requisite limited liability company

hereunder and thereunder. The Buyers performance of its obligations under the
Buyer Documents does not require any qualification, licensing or approval by
any foreign jurisdiction. The Buyer has taken all action necessary to execute
and deliver this Agreement and the other the Buyer Documents, as applicable,
to consummate the Transactions and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and no other action or proceeding on the part of the Buyer is

Buyer. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller of
this Agreement and of the Buyer Documents, this Agreement and the other Buyer
Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the Buyer,

respective Affiliates; _provided_ , the Buyer and the Seller agree that (a)
Section 14 of the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby revised such that the

Section 7.2 _Buyer Confidential Information_.

 



 

(a) _Buyer Confidential Information_. The Seller acknowledges that the Buyer
Confidential Information is valuable to the Buyer and, as of the Closing Date,
the Seller agrees not to disclose any Buyer Confidential Information other
than to its employees, agents, representatives and consultants who have a need
to know such information and which have executed non-disclosure agreements
consistent with the terms hereof or who are otherwise bound by confidentiality
consistent with the terms hereof, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer. For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Buyer Confidential Information_**
" shall mean any and all information related to the Buyer, the Company
Interests, the Company Group Entities and the Projects. Information shall not
be deemed to be the Buyer Confidential Information if it has become generally
known or available within the industry or the public through no act or
omission of the Seller.

 



 

(b) _Duty to Maintain Confidentiality_. The Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, maintain any Buyer Confidential Information in confidence and
shall not disclose it or cause it to be disclosed by the Seller or any third
party without the Buyers prior express written consent except as permitted in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding _Section 7.2(b)_, the Buyer
Confidential Information may be disclosed if required by any Authority or by
applicable Law or stock exchange rule; _provided, however_ , that (i) if the
Buyer Confidential Information is submitted under any and all applicable
provisions for confidential treatment and (ii) if the Seller is permitted to
do so, the Buyer shall be given written notice of the requirement for
disclosure promptly after such disclosure is requested, so that it may take
whatever action it deems appropriate, including intervention in any proceeding
and seeking a protective order or an injunction, to prohibit such disclosure.
If the Buyer Confidential Information is disclosed under the provisions of
this _Section 7.2(c)_, the Seller shall notify the Buyer of the same in
writing not later than five (5) Business Days following the disclosure.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.3 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall
issue any public announcement or other statement with respect to the financial
terms of this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior consent of the
other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless compliance with applicable Law or stock exchange rule
(including in connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this
Agreement and the Transactions from any Authority) does not allow for such
prior written consent; _provided, however_ , that the Buyer and the Seller
shall have the right without obtaining such consent to include public
information (excluding information that has been made public by a Partys
breach of its confidentiality obligations owing to the other Party) concerning
the Projects in its marketing materials, and, _provided, further_ , that (a)
each Party may disclose, without the consent of the other Party, the name,
location and size of the Projects and that the Seller sold the Projects, and

may otherwise be available, the non-breaching Party may, in its sole
discretion, issue public announcements that the non-breaching Party shall deem
to be appropriate in its sole discretion to supplement, correct or amplify the
announcement or statement made by the breaching Party. In no case shall either
Party disclose (in any public or other statement, marketing materials, or
otherwise) the identity of the other Party or its direct or indirect owners
without the other Partys prior written consent.

necessary to assist the Seller in making any filings or applications with any

Section 7.7 _Access Prior to Closing_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Date until the earlier of termination of this Agreement
or the Closing, the Seller shall give the Buyer reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, to all properties, books,
records and key management personnel of or pertaining to the applicable
Company Group Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not:
(i) interfere with the day-to-day operations of the Company Group Entities;
(ii) require the

 



       
 

 



 

Seller or the Company Group Entities to provide access or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would contravene any applicable
Law or Contract, would relate to commercially sensitive information, or would
result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product protection; or
(iii) include any sampling or testing for or regarding any environmental
matters without the Sellers prior written consent. Any information disclosed
prior to the Closing Date will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement will govern. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company
Group Entities may designate any competitively sensitive information made
available to the Buyer under this Agreement as "outside counsel only" and such
information shall be given only to the outside counsel of the Buyer and may
not be shared with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives (other than such outside counsel).

 



 

(b) The Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses, claims and causes
of action for personal injury, death or property damage occurring on or to
such property of the Company Group Entities as a result of the Buyer or its
Representatives entry onto or conduct while on the premises of the Company
Group Entities or any of their respective Affiliates. The Buyer agrees to
comply fully with all rules, regulations and instructions issued by the Seller
or any of its Affiliates regarding the actions of the Buyer and any of its
Representatives while upon, entering or leaving any such property.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer will pay one hundred percent (100%) of
any Transfer Taxes. Accordingly, if the Seller (or its Affiliates) is required
by Law to pay any portion of the Transfer Taxes, the Buyer will promptly
reimburse the Seller for such portion of the Transfer Taxes it pays, which
shall be, solely for tax purposes, treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price to the extent allowed by Law. The Party required by Law to file a
Transfer Taxes Tax Return or other documentation will do so within the time
period required by Law and provide to the other Parties a copy of the Tax
Return or other documentation, but will first alert the other Parties in
writing of the need to file such Tax Return or other documentation in case
there is any disagreement about whether Transfer Taxes are owed and the
Parties will work in good faith to resolve any disagreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Buyer will be solely responsible for any Taxes (including
Transfer Taxes) arising from any action to dissolve, terminate or restructure
the Company Group Entities or the Projects after the Closing or to convey,
distribute or transfer any assets, properties or other rights to or from the
Company Group Entities after the Closing.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. The Seller will
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
of the Company Group Entities for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (each such period, a " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Period_** ") that are
required to be filed (taking into account all properly obtained extensions)
after the Closing Date (each, a " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Return_** "). For each
such Pre-Closing Tax Return, the Seller will permit the Buyer to review and
comment on such Pre-Closing Tax Return prior to filing (or delivering for
filing by the Buyer) and will consider in good faith any revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Buyer. Without duplication of any
right to recovery herein, for any such Pre-Closing Tax Returns reporting Taxes
imposed on a Company Group

 



      
 

 



 

Entity and for which a Company Group Entity is primarily liable under Law, the
Seller shall reimburse the Buyer for such Taxes paid by or on behalf of a
Company Group Entity reflected on such Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Seller
shall have the right to control and represent the Company Group Entities with
respect to any Tax claims or audits for Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that with respect to the Tax Equity
Partnerships, Seller shall have such right only to the extent expressly
permitted by the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements (subject to the Buyers
reasonable cooperation and exercising its rights under the Tax Equity
Partnership Agreements in favor of the Seller (as such rights pertain to such
Tax claims or audits)); _provided, further_ , that with respect to any such
Tax claims or audits, (w) the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably and
timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
such Tax claim or audit, (x) the Buyer shall have the right to participate in
(but not to settle) any such Tax claim or audit at its expense, (y) the Seller
shall not settle any such Tax claims or audits without the consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (z) the Buyer shall to the extent it has the power to do so cause
the Company Group Entities to promptly, file any powers of attorney or other
documents required or reasonably requested by the Seller to allow the Seller
to represent the Company Group Entities in such Tax claims or audits.

 



 

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. The
Buyer shall cause the Company Group Entities to prepare or cause to be
prepared, in a manner consistent with past practice, and, if applicable, in a
manner consistent with _Section 7.11, _and file or cause to be filed any Tax
Returns for the Company Group Entities for Tax periods that begin on or before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle Period_**
"). The Buyer shall permit or shall cause the Company Group Entities to permit
the Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing and to make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Seller. For all purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes for any Straddle Period, the amount of
Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed to be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not
described in (i) above (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or
related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed in connection
with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as
if such taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date. Without
duplication of any right to recovery herein, for any such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns reporting Taxes imposed on a Company Group Entity and for which a
Company Group Entity is primarily liable under Law, the Seller shall reimburse
the Buyer for such Taxes paid by or on behalf of a Company Group Entity
reflected on such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period allocable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. The Buyer shall have the
right to represent the Company Group Entities with respect to any Tax claims
or audits with respect to all Straddle Periods; _provided, however_ , that
with respect to any such Tax matters other than with respect to each Tax
Equity Partnership and its Subsidiaries, (w) the Buyer shall keep the Seller
reasonably and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and
nature of any such Tax claim or audit, (x) the Seller shall have the right to
participate in (but not to settle) any such

 



      
 

 



 

Tax claim or audit at its expense, (y) the Seller shall not settle any such
Tax claims or audits without the consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, further,_ that
with respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships, the Buyer shall have such rights
only to the extent expressly permitted by the Tax Equity Partnership
Agreements and the Sellers rights under this _Section 7.9(b)_ shall apply
only as to such rights of the Buyer under the Tax Equity Partnership
Agreements.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) The Parties will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, and with respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships
only to the extent expressly permitted by the Tax Equity Partnership
Agreements, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_ and any audit, litigation or other action with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation will include (upon another Partys request and at such
requesting Partys sole cost and expense) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably available to the solicited Party and
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other action and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties
agree (to the extent such books and records are within their possession) (A)
to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company Group Entities relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Buyer, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Tax Authority and (B) to give the other Parties reasonable written
notice and with respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships only to the extent
expressly permitted by the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements, prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
Buyer so requests, the Seller will allow the Buyer (at the Buyers expense) to
take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(ii) The Parties further agree, upon request and at the expense of the
requesting Party, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including without
limitation with respect to the Transactions).

 



 

(iii) The Parties further agree that if any tax claim, audit or other Action
relating to Taxes is brought or asserted or threatened to be brought or
asserted with respect to the Company Group Entities for which the Seller may
be individually responsible or in respect of which indemnity may be sought
from the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer or its Affiliates shall
notify the Seller in writing as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty (20) days after the notification of such asserted, pending or
threatened Action); _provided, however_ , that the failure of the Buyer to
give timely notice hereunder shall relieve the Seller of its indemnification
obligations hereunder only if, and only to the extent that, such failure
caused the Buyer Damages for which the Seller is obligated to be greater than
they would have been had the Buyer given timely notice; _provided, further,_
that with respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have such obligation only to the extent expressly permitted by the Tax
Equity Partnership Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds_.

 



 

(i) All refunds of Taxes of the Company Group Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as
determined in accordance with the same principles provided in _Section
7.9(b)_) (whether in the form of cash received from the applicable Authority
or a direct credit against Taxes) shall be for the benefit of the Seller;
_provided_ that with respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships, only to the
extent expressly permitted by the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements and only
to the extent such refund is actually distributed by the Tax Equity
Partnership to the applicable Management Company, which distribution the Buyer
shall in good faith make commercially reasonable efforts to cause.

 



 

(ii) To the extent that the Buyer or a Company Group Entity receives a refund
that is for the benefit of the Seller as provided in and subject to _Section
7.9(d)(i)_, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such refund, net
of (A) any Taxes; and (B) any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Buyer
or the Company Group Entities or any of their Affiliates incur with respect to
such refund. The net amount due to the Seller shall be payable ten (10) days
after receipt of the refund from the applicable Authority (or, if the refund
is in the form of tax credit in lieu of a refund, ten (10) days after such
credit is actually utilized by the Buyer or a Company Group Entity, as
applicable, to reduce a tax liability).

 



 

(e) _Other Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) The Buyer shall not make or cause to be made any extraordinary
transaction, event, or effect as of the Closing Date (other than the purchase
and sale of the Company Interests) that could reasonably be expected to
increase the amount of Taxes directly imposed on the Seller or its Affiliates
or for which the Seller is required to indemnify the Buyer or the Companies
under this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer, the Companies and their Affiliates shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Seller (A) file (except in the manner set forth
in _Section 7.9(b)_), re-file or amend any Tax Returns of the Company Group
Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (B) make any
voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period, or (C) change any accounting method or adopt any convention
that shifts taxable income from a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after
the Closing Date to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date or shift deductions or losses from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to a period beginning
(or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that with
respect to the Tax Equity Partnerships, Buyer, the Companies and their
Affiliates shall have such obligation only to the extent expressly permitted
by the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements.

 



 

(iii) To the extent permitted under the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements, the
Seller and the Buyer shall cause (and to the extent not able to directly cause
under the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements, shall cooperate and in good faith
make commercially reasonable efforts to cause) each Company Group Entity that
is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the
time of the Closing to use the interim closing of the books method permitted
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.706-1(c)(2)(i) in applying Section 706(d)
of the Code (together with all comparable provisions of state and local income
tax law) to the

 



      
 

 



 

transfer of the Company Interests contemplated by this Agreement for the
purpose of determining the allocations of taxable income, gains, loss,
deduction and other items to any relevant Company Group Entitys members for
its taxable year including the Closing Date for federal income tax purposes
(as well as state and local income tax purposes to the extent based on federal
income tax purposes).

 



 

Section 7.10 _Transition Services Agreement_. Seller shall, or shall cause its

intentional breach of this Agreement prior to such termination; _provided,

_Section 7.2_ and _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX

except that (a) the representations and warranties of each of the Buyer and
the Seller relating to Taxes shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for the Tax at issue plus sixty (60) days,
(b) representations in _Section 5.8_ (Environmental Matters) shall survive
until the third anniversary of Closing Date, and (c) the Fundamental

performed at or prior to the Closing shall terminate as of the Closing and the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement required to be performed
following the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
terms. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, claims for Buyer
Damages under _Section 9.2(a)(iv_) that arise under or in connection with any
Tax Equity Document, including in respect of any surviving indemnity
obligation thereunder, may be brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party until the
later of (x) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the
Tax at issue (if any) plus sixty (60) days or (y) the last date on which the
Firstar may bring such claim under the Tax Equity Partnership Agreements plus
sixty (60) days.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By the Seller_. Subject to _Section 9.3_ and without duplication of any
rights to recovery or indemnity set forth herein, the Seller shall indemnify,
defend, save and hold harmless the Buyer and its employees, officers,
directors, managers, partners, stockholders, members, Affiliates (including,
from and after the Closing Date, each Company Group Entity),

 



      
 

 



 

fiduciaries, controlling Persons and agents and each of the employees,
officers, directors, managers, partners, stockholders, members, Affiliates,
fiduciaries, controlling Persons and agents of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the " ** _Buyer Indemnified Parties_** ") from and against any
and all Losses (whether arising out of direct claims or third-party claims),
including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts paid in investigation,
defense or settlement of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " ** _Buyer
Damages_** "), incurred in connection with or arising out of or resulting from
(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Sellers Representations, (ii) any breach
or violation by the Seller of the Sellers Covenants, (iii) without
duplication of any right to recovery herein, any failure by the Seller to
reimburse the Buyer or its Affiliates for any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Taxes for the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date or any other Taxes for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to
_Section 7.9(a)_ and _(b)_ or any "imputed underpayment" within the meaning
of Section 6225 of the Code of any Company Group Entity with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date or (iv) any claims, actions or suits made by third-parties
(before or after the Closing Date) against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to the extent related to the acts or omissions of (x) the Seller with respect
to a Company Group Entity or Project prior to the Closing or (y) a Company
Group Entity prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no claim for indemnification shall be brought
until the total Buyer Damages for which the Seller would be liable hereunder
exceeds in the aggregate an amount equal to $650,000 (the " ** _Indemnity
Threshold_** "), in which case the Seller shall be liable for the full amount
of Buyer Damages (starting at the first dollar of Buyer Damages), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers liability shall be limited as set forth in
_Section 9.3_; _provided_ , _further_ , that such limitation shall have no
application to any claim to recover Buyer Damages resulting from the Sellers
fraud or willful misconduct, the breach or inaccuracy of any the Sellers
Fundamental Representations, the breach or inaccuracy of _Section 5.16_ (Tax
Matters), or any breach or violation by the Seller of the Sellers Covenants
under _Section 7.9_ (Certain Tax Matters); _provided_ , _further_ , that
solely for purposes of determining whether Indemnity Threshold has been
satisfied in accordance with this _Section 9.2(a)_, each of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein or in the
Transaction Documents that contain any qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar affect shall be deemed to have
been given as though there were no such qualifications. Any request for an
indemnity payment hereunder shall be accompanied by a statement, certified to
by an officer of the Buyer, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such
request, including the Buyers then-current estimate of each item of Loss for
which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _By the Buyer_. Subject to _Section 9.3_ and without duplication of any
rights to recovery or indemnity set forth herein, the Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, save and hold harmless, the Seller, its Affiliates, and their
respective employees, officers, directors and managers (collectively, the " **
_Seller Indemnified Parties_** ") from and against any and all Losses (whether
or not arising out of direct or third-party claims), including reasonable
attorneys fees and amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of
any of the foregoing (collectively, the " ** _Seller Damages_** "), incurred
in connection with or arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any Buyers Representation, or (ii) any breach or violation of
any covenant or agreement of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement, (iii) any
failure of the Buyer, on or after the Closing Date, to pay, reimburse, perform
or discharge any liabilities of the Company Group Entities as and when due,
except to the extent they are subject to the Sellers obligations under

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.2(a)_ or would have been so subject but for the expiration of the
relevant claim filing period, or (iv) any claims, actions or suits made by
third-parties (after the Closing Date) against the Seller or any of its
Affiliates to the extent related to the acts or omissions of the Buyer with
respect to a Company Group Entity or Project after the Closing for such
Company Group Entity or Project; except to the extent they are subject to the
Sellers obligations under _Section 9.2(a_) or would have been so subject but
for the expiration of the relevant claim filing period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no claim for
indemnification shall be brought until the total Seller Damages for which the
Buyer would be liable hereunder exceeds in the aggregate an amount equal to
the Indemnity Threshold, in which case the Buyer shall be liable for the full
amount of Seller Damages (starting at the first dollar of Seller Damages),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyers liability shall be limited as set
forth in _Section 9.3_; _provided_ , _further_ , that such limitation shall
have no application to any claim to recover Seller Damages resulting from the
Buyers fraud or willful misconduct or the breach or inaccuracy of any the
Buyers Fundamental Representations or any breach or violation by the Buyer of
the Buyers covenants under _Section 7.9_ (Certain Tax Matters); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that solely for purposes of determining whether Indemnity
Threshold has been satisfied in accordance with this _Section 9.2(b)_, each
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein or in the
Transaction Documents that contain any qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar affect shall be deemed to have
been given as though there were no such qualifications. Any request for an
indemnity payment hereunder shall be accompanied by a statement, certified to
by an officer of the Seller, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such
request, including the Sellers then-current estimate of each item of Loss for
which the Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Claim Notices; Defense of Claims_.

 



 

(i) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party believes that a
claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this _Article IX_
(whether or not the amount of Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable),
such Indemnified Party shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving
written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which
indemnification is sought as promptly as practicable (and if the Indemnified
Party has been served with a the citation or summons such Claim Notice shall
in any event be provided within ten (10) Business Days of such service) (a "
_Claim Notice_ "); _provided, however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified
Party to give timely notice hereunder shall relieve the indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations hereunder only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure caused the Buyer Damages or the Seller Damages (as
applicable) for which the indemnifying Party is obligated to be greater than
they would have been had the Indemnified Party given timely notice.

 



 

(ii) Within thirty (30) days following receipt of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the relevant Indemnified Party in writing if
the Indemnifying Party disputes that all or a portion of such Indemnity Claim
is subject to indemnification hereunder, specifying the portion, if
applicable, so disputed. If the Indemnifying Party does not dispute such
Indemnity Claim within such thirty (30) days it shall be deemed to have
disputed that such Indemnity Claim is subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in any such
Indemnity Claim that relates to a third-party claim and to which it agrees is
subject to indemnification hereunder, and to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Such Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Action and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such Action or
shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party in any such Action in either case, promptly and no more than
thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt of notice pursuant to the
preceding sentence or such shorter period of time as shall be reasonable under
the circumstances, (iii) the named parties to any such Action (including any
impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that
there involves an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and the indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies
the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at
the reasonable expense of the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such Action on behalf of such
Indemnified Party) or (iii) such action could reasonably be expected to result
in the imposition of criminal liability, in which each of the foregoing cases
the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying for separate counsel
for the Indemnified Party; _provided, however_ , that if there is more than
one Indemnified Party and it is practical for all such Persons to be
represented by common counsel, the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible
for paying for more than one law firm to represent the Indemnified Party,
regardless of the number of Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume (or fails to assume) the defense of such Action, or at
any time fails diligently to pursue such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to assume the defense of such action with counsel of its own
choice, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any such Action effected without its
written consent (unless such consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), but if settled with its written consent or without its written
consent (if such written consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such
Action, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such
indemnified parties from and against any Losses by reason of such settlement
or judgment. The Indemnified Party shall not be required to consent to the
settlement of any Action unless such settlement fully releases the Indemnified
Party from all obligations and liabilities in connection with such Action and
provides solely for the payment of money, to be paid solely by the
indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and subject to the following sentence, from and after Closing the
indemnification obligations of the Parties contained in this _Section 9.2_
(and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy, entitlement and recourse of the Parties hereto, their
Affiliates, successors and assigns with respect to any and all claims for the
Buyer Damages or the Seller Damages, as applicable, sustained or incurred
arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation or warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, including any claims with
respect to environmental, health or safety matters (other than claims arising
from fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation by the
indemnifying Party or its Affiliates); and each Party hereby expressly waives
and disclaims, and agrees that it shall not

 



      
 

 



 

assert, any right, remedy (including the remedy of rescission) or claim in
respect of any such breach or Losses based on any cause or form of action
whatsoever, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, except as and to the
extent permitted in this _Section 9.2_; _provided, however_ , that (i) the
Parties may seek to enforce the provisions of this Agreement by injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief, (ii) either Party may seek any
and all judicial relief with respect to any default by another Party of any of
its obligations to pay any amounts due and owing to such Party under this
Agreement, and (iii) such limitation shall not affect the remedies available
to the parties to the Ancillary Agreements, which remedies shall be governed
by the terms of the Ancillary Agreements. Nothing in this _Section 9.2(d)_ is
intended to constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that any Party (or
its respective Affiliates) may have to assert claims against third parties
(other than Affiliates of the Parties).

 



 

(e) _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 



 

(i) Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue and collect on any recovery available under any insurance policies;
_provided,_ that no Indemnified Party shall be required to initiate a legal
proceeding in connection with such efforts and the indemnifying Partys
obligations to indemnify hereunder shall not be delayed on account of such
efforts subject to the provisions set forth below regarding subsequent
recoveries. The amount of Losses payable under this _Article IX_ by the
indemnifying Party shall be reduced by any and all amounts actually recovered
by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of any actual costs incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery or increases in
insurance premiums paid by the Indemnified Party solely as a result of such
recovery). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying Party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification up to the amount received by
the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in collecting such amount.

 



 

(ii) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable hereunder. In the event that an Indemnified Party fails to use
commercially reasonable efforts to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the
indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such Loss that
reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnified Party made such
efforts. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after an
Indemnified Party acquires knowledge of any fact or circumstance that results
in or reasonably would be expected to result in an indemnified Loss for which
the indemnifying Party may have an obligation to provide indemnification
hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall notify the indemnifying Party promptly
and implement such reasonable actions as the indemnifying Party shall request
for the purposes of mitigating the possible Losses arising therefrom. The
failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the
extent that the Indemnified Party is prejudiced by such failure.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) All Losses incurred pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement
will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price solely for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The amount of any
indemnity payment not constituting an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
income Tax purposes in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will
be grossed up and paid on an after-tax basis (employing the marginal federal,
state and local income tax rates then applicable to the Buyer (or if the Buyer
is a flow-through tax entity, the rates applicable to each of its direct or
indirect owners that are regarded entities for tax purposes and that are not
flow-through tax entities) as reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party).

 



 

(g) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article IX_, at the election of the
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable
and subject to applicable Law and limitations imposed by any relevant
Contracts, assign to the Indemnifying Party all of its claims for recovery
against third Persons as to such Losses, whether by insurance coverage,
contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

 



 

(h) _[Intentionally omitted.]_

 



 

(i) _Indemnity Credit Support_. The Sellers obligations for Buyer Damages
hereunder shall be paid as follows: first, from a draw or call upon the
Indemnity Credit Support up the full amount available thereunder; and second,
if the Indemnity Credit Support has been exhausted or such claim is made
following the release of the Indemnity Credit Support, as the case may be, the
Buyer shall be entitled to pursue recovery against the Seller directly for
such Buyer Damages subject to the other limitations set forth herein.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary which may be contained herein: IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, REMOTE, UNFORESEEABLE,
SPECULATIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT LOSSES OR DAMAGES (IN TORT, CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE) UNDER OR IN RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, in each of the foregoing
cases except to the extent the foregoing are components of third-party claims
in respect of which an Indemnified Party is entitled to protection under this
Article IX, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be included as Losses
herein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including
_Section 9.2_, except in the case of fraud, willful misconduct, breach of a
Fundamental Representation, the aggregate Buyer Damages to which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled hereunder shall not exceed the Indemnity
Cap and the aggregate Seller Damages to which the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled hereunder shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap. The provisions
of this _Section 9.3_, together with the provisions of _Section 9.2_ and the
limited remedies provided in this _Article IX_, were specifically bargained-
for between the Buyer and the Seller and were taken into account by the Buyer
and the Seller in arriving at the Purchase Price and in agreeing to the
specific representations and warranties set forth herein. No past, present or
future Representative, Affiliate, agent, or attorney of the Company Group
Entities, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort)

 



      
 

 



 

for any obligations or liabilities of the Company Group Entities, the Seller
or any of their Affiliates arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
sale and purchase of the Company Group Entities, including, any alleged non-
disclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Persons.

MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 10.1 _No Partnership or Joint Venture_. The Parties hereto do not
intend to create a partnership or joint venture by virtue of this Agreement.
No Party shall owe any fiduciary duty to any other Party by virtue of this
Agreement or any other Seller Document or Buyer Document or otherwise.

assignments by the Buyer to its Affiliates, or (ii) any collateral assignments
by Buyer to a financing party or any such financing partys collateral agent
or similar agent.

Section 10.9 _Delivery by PDF_. This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, to
the extent signed and delivered by means of electronic transmission in
portable document format (pdf), shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original Contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any Party, each other Party shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to the other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of
electronic transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature was transmitted or communicated through such means as a defense to
the formation of a Contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Invalidity_. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to
herein (other than a requirement to make payments hereunder), shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any
other such instrument.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Titles_. The recitals to this Agreement and the titles,
captions or headings of the Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be entitled to indemnification, with
full rights of enforcement as though each such Person were a signatory to this
Agreement. Except as provided in this _Section 10.12_, there shall be no
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Cumulative Remedies_. All rights and remedies of either Party
hereto are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such
Party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more
rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent
exercise of other rights or remedies.

 



 

Section 10.14 _No Merger_. This Agreement is a fully integrated complete
agreement and is not merged with or extinguished by any other agreement.
