Stock equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio.   (i) The term "Stock Exchange
Ratio" means the  quotient of the Base Consideration Value divided by the
Stock  Value.   (ii) The term "Base Consideration Value" means (w)  $4.09
plus (x) the product of the Stock Value times the Base  Exchange Ratio;
provided, that if the Stock Value is less than  the Floor Price and DHI so
elects, as provided in SECTION  7.1(f), the Base Consideration Value shall be
the sum of (y)  the Adjusted Cash Amount plus (z) the product of the
Adjusted  Exchange Ratio times the Stock Value; provided, further, that  the
sum of (y) and (z) shall not be less than $14.25.   Company Shares for which
a Stock Election has been made are hereinafter  sometimes referred to as the
"Stock Election Shares."   (c) Subject to SECTION 2.1.3(d), for each such
Company Share  with respect to which an election to receive cash has been

Consideration Value. Company Shares for which a Cash Election has been  made
are hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Cash Election  Shares."   (d)
If the Requested Cash Amount exceeds the Cash  Consideration, the Merger
Consideration for each Cash Election Share  shall be cash and DHI Common
Stock as set forth below:   (i) Cash equal to the product of (y) the Base 
Consideration Value times (z) the quotient of the Cash  Consideration divided
by the Requested Cash Amount.   (ii) A fraction of a share of DHI Common
Stock equal  to the quotient of (y) the Base Consideration Value minus the 
cash payable pursuant to SECTION 2.1.3(d)(i), divided by (z)  the Stock
Value.   (iii) The term "Requested Cash Amount" means the  aggregate amount
of cash that would be payable with respect to  Non-Election Shares and Cash
Election Shares before any  adjustments pursuant to SECTION 2.1.3(e) or this
SECTION  2.1.3(d).     5   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc. 
Agreement and Plan of Merger    (iv) The term "Cash Consideration" means
the  difference between (y) the product of $4.09 times the number  of
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other
than shares cancelled pursuant to  SECTION 2.1.2), minus (z) the product of
the number of  Dissenting Shares (immediately prior to the Effective Time) 
times the Base Consideration Value.   (e) If the Requested Cash Amount is
less than the Cash  Consideration, the Merger Consideration for each Stock
Election Share  shall be cash and DHI Common Stock as set forth below:  
(i) Cash equal to the quotient of (y) the Cash  Consideration minus the
Requested Cash Amount, divided by (z)  the number of Stock Election
Shares.   (ii) A fraction of a share of DHI Common Stock equal  to the
quotient of (y) the Base Consideration Value minus the  cash payable pursuant
to SECTION 2.1.3(e)(i), divided by (z)  the Stock Value.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except where DHI has made  an election in
accordance with SECTION 7.1(f), if more than 50% of the  total value of the
Merger Consideration for all the outstanding Company  Shares other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with SECTION  2.1.2 would be cash
(treating all stockholders who give the Company a  timely and proper notice
of intention to exercise appraisal rights as  receiving Merger Consideration
consisting of cash equal to the value of  the Merger Consideration to be
received in the Merger prior to any  adjustment under this SECTION 2.1.3(f)
(or such other amount as the  Board of Directors of DHI determines to be
appropriate at the time,  based on the advice from DHI tax counsel) for each
share as to which  the notice relates, and treating for this purpose the DHI
Common Stock  receivable in the Merger as having a value per share equal to
the  closing price of DHI Common Stock as reported for NYSE Composite 
Transactions on the Closing Date), the cash which a holder of a share  of
Company Common Stock will receive will be reduced on a pro rata  basis with
all other such holders to the amount such that 50% of the  total value of the
Merger Consideration will be cash (treating all  stockholders who give the
Company a timely and proper notice of  intention to exercise appraisal rights
as receiving Merger  Consideration consisting of cash equal to the value of
the Merger  Consideration to be received in the Merger prior to any
adjustment  under this provision (or such other amount as DHI determines to
be  appropriate at the time, based on the advice from its tax counsel) for 
each share as to which the notice relates, and treating for this  purpose the
DHI Common Stock received as having a value per share equal  to the closing
price of DHI Common Stock for NYSE Composite  Transactions on the Closing
Date) and the holders of Company Common  Stock will receive in exchange for
such reduction in cash an amount of  additional shares of DHI Common Stock
obtained by dividing the amount  of such     6   D.R. Horton, Inc. /
Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger    reduction in cash by
the closing price of DHI Common Stock for NYSE  Composite Transactions on the
Closing Date.   2.1.4 SHARE ELECTION.   (a) Each person who, on or prior
to the Election Date, is a  record holder of shares of Company Shares shall
have the right to  submit a Form of Election specifying one of the following:
(i) that  such stockholder desires that all of his or her Company Shares be 
converted into the Base Consideration (such election being hereinafter 
sometimes referred to as a "Base Election"), (ii) that such stockholder 
desires that all of his or her Company Shares be converted into cash 
pursuant to the Cash Election, or (iii) that such stockholder desires  that
all of his or her Company Shares be converted into Stock Election  Shares
pursuant to the Stock Election. A stockholder may not make an  election for
less than all of his or her Company Shares.   (b) DHI shall prepare, subject
to the reasonable approval of  the Company, a form of election (the "Form of
Election") for mailing  with the Proxy Statement. The Form of Election shall
be (i) mailed to  the record holders of Company Shares as of the record date
for the  Company Stockholder Meeting, and (ii) used by each record holder
of  Company Shares to make the Base Election, the Cash Election or the 
Stock Election. The Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts  to
make the Form of Election and the Proxy Statement available to all  persons
who become holders of Company Shares during the period between  such record
date and the Election Date. Any such holder\'s Base  Election, Cash Election
or Stock Election shall have been properly made  only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received at its designated  office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City
time on the business day next  preceding the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (the "Election  Date"), a Form of Election properly completed and
signed and  accompanied by certificate(s) for the Company Shares
("Certificate(s)")  to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in
blank or  otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company  (or by an appropriate guarantee for delivery of such Certificate(s)
as  set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is a member of a 
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust 
company having an office or correspondent in the United States,  provided
that such Certificate(s) are in fact delivered to the Exchange  Agent within
three trading days after the date of execution of such  guarantee of
delivery).   (c) Any Form of Election may be revoked by a record holder of 
Company Common Stock submitting such Form of Election to the Exchange  Agent
only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to  5:00 p.m.,
New York City time on the Election Date. In addition, all  Forms of Election
shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent  is notified in writing
by DHI and the Company that the Merger has been  abandoned or if either the
Company\'s or DHI\'s stockholders fail to  approve the Merger. If a Form of
Election is revoked     7   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc. 
Agreement and Plan of Merger    because the Merger has been abandoned or if
either the Company\'s or  DHI\'s stockholders fail to approve the Merger, the
Certificate(s) (or  guarantee(s) of delivery, if applicable) for the share(s)
of Company  Common Stock, if any, to which such Form of Election relates
shall  promptly be returned to the stockholder submitting the same to the 
Exchange Agent.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a holder of Common
Stock  who does not submit a Form of Election which is received by the 
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Date or who submits a Form of  Election
that is not properly made or who acquires Company Shares after  the date
hereof pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be  deemed to have
made a Non-Election. If DHI or the Exchange Agent shall  determine that any
purported Base Election, Cash Election or Stock  Election was not properly
made, such purported Base Election, Cash  Election or Stock Election shall be
deemed to be of no force and effect  and the holder making such purported
Base Election, Cash Election or  Stock Election shall, for purposes of this
Agreement, be deemed to have  made a Non-Election.   (e) DHI shall have the
sole discretion, which it may delegate  in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, to determine whether Forms  of Election have been properly completed,
signed and submitted or  revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms
of Election. The  decision of DHI (or the Exchange Agent, if applicable) in
such matters  shall be conclusive and binding. Neither DHI nor the Exchange
Agent  shall be under any obligation to notify any stockholder of any
defect  in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange 
Agent shall make all computations contemplated by SECTION 2.1.3(d) and 
SECTION 2.1.3(e) and all such computations shall be conclusive and  binding
on the holders of Company Common Stock.   2.1.5 COMPANY SHARES CANCELLED.
Upon conversion pursuant to SECTION  2.1.3, all Company Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist, and  each holder thereof shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto  other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any other  amounts in accordance with the terms provided
herein. All shares of DHI  Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration shall
be fully paid and  nonassessable.   2.1.6 STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to  purchase Company Common Stock (a "Company
Stock Option") granted under  the Company\'s Amended and Restated 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan or Amended  and Restated 1992 Stock Option Plan (collectively,
the "Company Stock  Plans") other than options granted under Article III of
either Company  Stock Plan ("Director Options"), whether or not then vested
or  exercisable, shall be replaced by the Surviving Corporation with a 
comparable option to purchase DHI Common Stock (a "DHI Stock Option"),  in
accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to  which it was
granted and any stock option agreement by which it is  evidenced, except that
if the holder of such DHI Stock     8   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler
Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger    Option is involuntarily
terminated as an employee of the Surviving  Corporation or any subsidiary
without Cause for Termination (and not on  account of death or disability)
within six months after the Effective  Time such Company Stock Option shall
become exercisable and shall vest  to the extent not theretofore exercisable
or vested as of the date of  termination of employment. It is intended that
the foregoing provisions  shall be undertaken in a manner that will not
constitute a  "modification" as defined in Section 424 of the Code as to any
stock  option which is an "incentive stock option." Each DHI Stock Option 
shall be exercisable for that number of shares of DHI Common Stock  equal to
the number of the Company Shares subject to the corresponding  Company Stock
Option multiplied by the Stock Exchange Ratio, and shall  have an exercise
price per share equal to its exercise price per  Company Share divided by the
Stock Exchange Ratio. DHI and the Company  shall take all such steps as may
be required to cause the transactions  contemplated by this SECTION 2.1.6 and
any other dispositions of equity  securities of the Company or acquisitions
of DHI equity securities in  connection with this Agreement by each
individual who (i) is a director  or officer of the Company, or (ii) at the
Effective Time, will become a  director or officer of DHI, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 of the  Exchange Act. Director Options shall accelerate and become
exercisable,  and subsequently terminate, upon consummation of the Merger,
each as  provided in Article III.A of the Company Stock Plans. Holders of
shares  of Company Common Stock received upon exercise of Director Options 
shall not have the option to elect any form of Merger Consideration  other
than the Base Consideration, and such Company Common Stock shall  be deemed
to be a Non-Election Share and shall be converted into a  right to receive
the Base Consideration.   2.1.7 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Company shall take
all actions necessary  so that (i) no person may participate in the
Company\'s 1998 Stock  Purchase Plan (the "Company Stock Purchase Plan")
except for such  participants participating in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan on  September 1, 2001; (ii) no participant in the Company Stock
Purchase  Plan may change any election or withholding amount made on or
before  September 1, 2001, except to exercise otherwise available rights to 
reduce such participant\'s rate of payroll deduction or terminate such 
employee\'s outstanding purchase rights under the Company Stock Purchase 
Plan; (iii) at least ten days prior to the Closing Date, all  participants in
the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall have received  notice of the Merger and
the right to terminate their outstanding  purchase rights at any time prior
to the Closing Date; (iv) all  outstanding rights to purchase Company Common
Stock pursuant to the  Company Stock Purchase Plan shall have been exercised
as of the close  of business on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date in  accordance with the provisions of the Company Stock Purchase Plan
(the  "Final Exercise"); and (v) the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall 
terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. No participant in  the
Company Stock Purchase Plan shall have the option to elect any form  of
Merger Consideration with respect to shares of Company Common Stock 
purchased in the Final Exercise other than the Base Consideration and,  at
the Effective Time, each Company Share issued upon the     9   D.R.
Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger    Final
Exercise shall be deemed to be a Non-Election Share and shall be  converted
into the right to receive the Base Consideration. DHI shall  be entitled to
deduct from the cash component of the Merger  Consideration to be delivered
to the participants of the Company Stock  Purchase Plan all applicable
withholding taxes attributable to the  exercise of such purchase rights.  
2.1.8 ADJUSTMENT OF BASE EXCHANGE RATIO. If after the date hereof and  prior
to the Effective Time there shall have been a change in the DHI  Common
Stock, by reason of a stock split (including a reverse split) of  the DHI
Common Stock or a dividend payable in the DHI Common Stock, or  any other
distribution of securities to holders of the DHI Common Stock  with respect
to their DHI Common Stock (including without limitation  such a distribution
made in connection with a recapitalization,  reclassification, merger,
consolidation, reorganization or similar  transaction) or otherwise, then the
Base Exchange Ratio, the Stock  Value and the dollar amounts set forth in
clauses (i) through (v), (ix)  and (x) of SECTION 2.1.3(a) shall be
appropriately adjusted; provided,  however, that the aggregate amount of
Merger Consideration shall not be  adjusted below the amount provided for in
this Article 2.   2.1.9 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding SECTION 2.1,
shares of Company  Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective  Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has
properly  exercised his or her demand for appraisal rights under, and
complies in  all respects with, Section 262 of the Delaware Law (the
"Dissenting  Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger  Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled  to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with
the  provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law; provided, however, that 
if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or otherwise shall 
effectively waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment  under
the Delaware Law or a court of competent jurisdiction shall  determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by  Section 262 of the
Delaware Law, then the right of such holder to be  paid the fair value of
such holder\'s Dissenting Shares under Section  262 of the Delaware Law shall
cease to exist and such holder\'s shares  of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been  converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive, without  interest, the Merger Consideration receivable by
Non-Election Shares,  and such shares shall be deemed not to be Dissenting
Shares. The  Company shall give DHI (i) prompt notice of any notices or
demands for  appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received
by the  Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate and direct all 
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices or demands.  The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of DHI, make  any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise  negotiate
any demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company  Common Stock. The
parties acknowledge that the amounts referred to in  SECTIONS 2.1.3(d) and
(f) in respect of Dissenting Shares are included  for tax planning purposes
only and     10   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement
and Plan of Merger    are not intended as a statement as to the value of
the Dissenting  Shares for the purposes of Section 262 of the Delaware
Law.  2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   2.2.1 EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, DHI  shall enter into an agreement with a
bank or trust company designated  by DHI (the "Exchange Agent"), providing
that DHI shall deposit with  the Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for
the benefit of the  holders of the Company Shares, for exchange in accordance
with SECTIONS  2.1.3 and 2.1.4 and this SECTION 2.2 through the Exchange
Agent, (i)  cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount payable pursuant
to  SECTION 2.1, (ii) certificates representing the shares of DHI Common 
Stock issuable pursuant to SECTION 2.1 and (iii) cash in an amount  equal to
the aggregate amount required to be paid in lieu of fractional  interests of
DHI Common Stock pursuant to SECTION 2.2.5 (such cash and  shares of DHI
Common Stock, together with any dividends or  distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the  Effective Time and the cash referred to
in clause (iii) of this SECTION  2.2.1 being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") in exchange  for outstanding Company Shares. Until they are
distributed, the shares  of DHI Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent shall
be deemed to be  outstanding, but the Exchange Agent shall not vote such
shares or  exercise any rights of a stockholder with regard to them.  
2.2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. (a) After the Effective Time, Certificate(s) 
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding 
Company Shares delivered by each holder of record whose shares were 
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and who 
effectively made, or who did not revoke or lose, a Base Election, Cash 
Election or Stock Election, shall be deemed surrendered, and the holder  of
record thereof shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for the 
Certificate(s) delivered with such election, a certificate representing  that
number of whole shares of DHI Common Stock, if any, and cash, if  any, which
such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to the  provisions of SECTIONS
2.1 and 2.2. The Certificate(s) so surrendered  shall forthwith be
canceled.   (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the 
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s)  whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration but
who did not effectively make, or who revoked or lost,  a Base Election, Cash
Election or Stock Election, (i) a letter of  transmittal and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of  the Certificate(s) in
exchange for the Base Consideration. Upon  surrender of such Certificate(s)
for cancellation to the Exchange  Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and  such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange  Agent, the holder of such Certificate(s) shall be
entitled to receive  in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole  shares of DHI Common Stock and cash which such holder
has     11   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and
Plan of Merger    the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
SECTIONS 2.1 and  2.2, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled.   (c) If any cash or any certificate representing DHI Shares
is  to be paid to or issued in a name other than that in which a 
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, a  certificate
representing the proper number of shares of DHI Common  Stock may be issued
to a person other than the person in whose name the  Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be  properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the  person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any  transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of cash or  the issuance of shares of DHI Common
Stock to a person other than the  registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction  of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this SECTION
2.2, each Certificate  shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only  the right to receive upon such surrender the cash, the
certificate  representing shares of DHI Common Stock or cash in lieu of any 
fractional shares of DHI Common Stock, as applicable, as contemplated  by
this SECTION 2.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any  cash so
payable.   2.2.3 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or  other distributions declared or made with respect to DHI Common
Stock  with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder  of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the DHI Common
Stock  represented thereby by reason of the conversion of shares of Company 
Common Stock pursuant to SECTION 2.1.3 and no cash shall be paid to any  such
holder until such Certificate is surrendered or deemed surrendered  in
accordance with this ARTICLE 2. Subject to the effect of applicable  laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid,  without
interest, to the person in whose name the shares of DHI Common  Stock
representing such securities are registered (i) at the time of  such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable to which such holder is  entitled
pursuant to this SECTION 2.2 and (ii) at the appropriate  payment date or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the  proportionate amount of dividends or
other distributions, with (x) a  record date with respect thereto after the
Effective Time, but prior to  such surrender, and (y) a payment date
subsequent to such surrender,  payable with respect to such shares of DHI
Common Stock. If any holder  of converted Company Shares shall be unable to
surrender such holder\'s  Certificates because such Certificates shall have
been lost or  destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit
and  indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably 
satisfactory to DHI.   2.2.4 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY SHARES.
All shares of DHI  Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in  accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 2 (including any
cash paid  pursuant to SECTIONS 2.2.3) shall be deemed to have been issued
and  paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company 
Shares theretofore represented by such     12   D.R. Horton, Inc. /
Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger    Certificates. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented  to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they  shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE 2, except  as otherwise provided by
law.   2.2.5 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing 
fractional shares of DHI Common Stock shall be issued upon the  surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share  interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights  of a stockholder of DHI.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this  Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares exchanged pursuant to the  Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of  a share of DHI Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates  delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without  interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of DHI  Common Stock multiplied by the per share
closing price of DHI Common  Stock as reported for NYSE Composite
Transactions on the Closing Date.  The parties acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu  of issuing fractional shares was not
separately bargained for  consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for  purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting
complexities which  would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares.   2.2.6 TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund  which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for
six  months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to DHI, upon
demand,  and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied  with this ARTICLE 2 shall thereafter look only to DHI for payment
of  cash and DHI Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of DHI 
Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to DHI  Common
Stock, all without interest.   2.2.7 NO LIABILITY. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law,  none of DHI, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any  person in respect of any shares of DHI Common Stock
(or dividends or  distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund  delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned  property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not
have  been surrendered prior to the end of the applicable period after the 
Effective Time under escheat laws (or immediately prior to such earlier  date
on which any Merger Consideration or any dividends or  distributions with
respect to DHI Common Stock in respect of such  Certificates would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any  governmental entity), any such
shares, cash, dividends or distributions  in respect of such Certificates
shall, to the extent permitted by  applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free  and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled  thereto.   2.2.8 INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any  cash included in the Exchange Fund on a
daily basis as directed by DHI.  Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be  paid to DHI.     13   D.R. Horton, Inc. /
Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger    2.2.9 TRANSFER TAXES.
DHI and the Company shall cooperate in the  preparation, execution and filing
of all returns, applications or other  documents regarding any real property
transfer, stamp, recording,  documentary or other taxes and any other fees
and similar taxes which  become payable in connection with the Merger other
than transfer or  stamp taxes payable in respect of transfers pursuant to
SECTION  2.2.2(c) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). From and after the
Effective  Time, DHI shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or 
withholding from any amounts payable to the holders of Company Shares,  all
Transfer Taxes.   2.2.10 RETURN OF MERGER CONSIDERATION. Any portion of the
Merger  Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent to pay for 
Dissenting Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall  be
returned to DHI promptly on demand.   ARTICLE 3   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby represents and warrants to
DHI that, except as set forth in the written disclosure schedule delivered on
or prior to the date hereof by the Company to DHI that is arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in
this ARTICLE 3 (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"):  3.1 ORGANIZATION,

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State

conducted. The Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the nature or character of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or be in
good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has delivered to DHI a complete and correct copy of its Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to the date hereof. As used in this
ARTICLE 3, the term "Company" includes Schuler Residential, Inc. (formerly
known as Schuler Homes, Inc.) as to any period prior to the merger of such
person into the Company on June 21, 2001, including without limitation the
period from April 3, 2001 to June 21, 2001 during which such person was a
subsidiary of the Company, but does not include Schuler Residential, Inc. as
a separate entity from and after the effective time of such merger, including
without limitation the date hereof and the Closing Date.  3.2 ORGANIZATION,
EXISTENCE AND GOOD STANDING OF COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES. The Company\'s Annual

is a corporation, business trust, general or limited partnership or limited
liability company (as so specified) duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as applicable. Each Company Subsidiary has all necessary entity
power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the nature or
character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except for the Company Subsidiaries, the
Company does not, directly or indirectly, own any equity interest in any
other corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, business
organization or limited liability company or other entity, with respect to
which interest the Company or any Company Subsidiary has invested or is
required to invest $100,000 or more, excluding securities in any publicly

Agreement and Plan of Merger    any Company Employee Plan, which would
result in a Company Material  Adverse Effect; (iii) all Company Employee
Plans are in compliance with  the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes (including ERISA  and the Code), orders, or governmental rules and
regulations currently  in effect with respect thereto (including all
applicable requirements  for notification to participants or the Department
of Labor, the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), Internal
Revenue  Service (the "IRS") or Secretary of the Treasury) except as would
not  individually or in the aggregate result in a Company Material Adverse 
Effect, and the Company and each Company Subsidiary have performed all 
obligations required to be performed by them under, and are not in  default
under or violation of any of the Company Employee Plans except  as would not
individually or in the aggregate result in a Company  Material Adverse
Effect; (iv) each Company Employee Plan intended to  qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to  qualify under Section 501(a)
of the Code is so qualified and is the  subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS; (v) all  contributions required to be made to any
Company Employee Plan pursuant  to Section 412 of the Code, or the terms of
the Company Employee Plan  or any collective bargaining agreement, have been
made on or before  their due dates; (vi) with respect to each Company
Employee Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA, no "reportable event" within the
meaning  of Section 4043 of ERISA nor any event described in Section 4062,
4063  or 4041 of ERISA has occurred; (vii) neither the Company nor any 
Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred, nor reasonably expects to incur,  any
liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premium  payments
to the PBGC arising in the ordinary course); (viii) except as  provided by
Sections 204(h), 4041(a)(2) or 104(b)(1) of ERISA, each  Company Employee
Plan can be amended or terminated at any time without  approval from any
person, without advance notice, and without any  liability other than for
benefits accrued prior to such amendment or  termination; (ix) except as set
forth in SECTION 3.15.2 of the Company  Disclosure Schedule, all benefits due
under each Employee Plan have  been timely paid and there is no material
lawsuit or claim, other than  routine uncontested claims for benefits,
pending, or to the knowledge  of the Company, any Company ERISA Affiliate or
Company Subsidiary,  threatened, against any Company Employee Plan or the

have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to any material collective bargaining agreement
or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company

proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees; and (iii) the
Company has no knowledge of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts,
or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary which could reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date
hereof, no executive or management employee of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries intends to terminate his employment in connection
with the Merger.  3.17 RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. Except for this
Agreement, there is no agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any affiliate thereof,
which has or would have the effect of prohibiting the conduct of business by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary as currently conducted, except for any
prohibitions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.  3.18 REAL PROPERTY. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have good and marketable (or indefeasible, in jurisdictions
where the term "marketable" is not customarily used in such a context) title
in fee simple to the real property purported to be owned by them, and, upon
the exercise of any options to acquire real property optioned by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, the Company or such Company Subsidiary will have
good and marketable (or indefeasible, in jurisdictions where the term
"marketable" is not customarily used in such a context) title in fee simple
to such optioned property, in each case free and clear of all liens, charges
and encumbrances, except liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and such
liens or other encumbrances as do not or will not materially interfere with
the present use or intended use by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
or materially affect the value of or the ability to market to customers the
property affected thereby and that do not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries hold valid policies of title insurance issued by reputable title
insurance companies on each parcel of real property owned by them in amounts
equal to the purchase price paid by the Company or such Company Subsidiary at
the time of its acquisition thereof. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has given, nor have they received, any notice or
information indicating that the facts set forth in any surveys or title
insurance policies are untrue or incorrect in any material respect nor has
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries received any notice that a breach or
an event of default exists, and no condition or event has occurred that with
the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both would constitute a breach or
event of default, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or to the
knowledge of the Company, any other person with respect to any material
contracts, covenants, conditions and restrictions, deeds, deeds of    
22   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of
Merger   trust, rights-of-way, easements, mortgages and other documents
granting to the Company or any Company Subsidiary title to or an interest in
or otherwise affecting the real property which is material to the operation
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as presently
conducted or intended to be conducted, except for such breach or event of
default that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no condemnation,
eminent domain, or similar proceeding exists, is pending or threatened with
respect to, or that could affect, any real property owned or leased by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, injunction, order,
decree, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, moratorium, or other action by
a Governmental Entity, or to the knowledge of the Company, pending before or
being considered by a Governmental Entity, which has or would have the effect
of restricting the conduct of business by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as currently conducted or intended to be conducted by them, except
for any restrictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No developer-related charges or assessments
for off-site improvements payable to any public authority or any other person
for public improvements are unpaid (other than those reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet or incurred since the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of the Company\'s business consistent with past practices),
except for charges or assessments as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
the Company, there is no material impediment to obtaining any permits
or governmental approvals required to develop lots or construct homes
on undeveloped real property held by the Company or a Company Subsidiary for
such purpose (the "Company Development Properties"), except for such as is
not reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company Development Properties have access to public streets, and are
serviced (or will be serviced in accordance with "will serve letters" issued
by the appropriate utility provider), in all material respects, by water, gas
and electricity and other services that may be necessary to construct homes
on such properties, and to the knowledge of the Company such utilities and
other services are or will be adequate for the current and intended use of
such property. All material leases pursuant to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary leases from others real or personal property are valid and
in full force and effect and no default or event of default by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries has occurred thereunder, except where the lack of
such validity and effectiveness or the existence of such defaults or event of
defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.  3.19 TAXES.   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax"
or "Taxes" shall mean taxes, fees, levies, duties, tariffs, imposts, and
governmental impositions or charges of any kind, in the nature of taxes,

valorem, net worth, value added, sales, use, service, real or personal
property, special assessments, capital stock, license, payroll, withholding,

Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger   compensation,
unemployment compensation, utility, severance, production, excise, stamp,
occupation, premiums, windfall profits, transfer and gains taxes, including
interest, penalties, additional taxes and additions to tax imposed with
respect thereto, (ii) any liability for payment of amounts described
in clause (i) whether as a result of transferee liability, of being a member
of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group for any period, or
otherwise through operation of law, and (iii) any liability for the payment
of amounts described in clauses (i) or (ii) as a result of any tax sharing,
tax indemnity or tax allocation agreement or any other express or implied
agreement to indemnify any other person. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax
Returns" shall mean returns, reports, and information statements with respect
to Taxes required to be filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority,
domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, consolidated, combined
and unitary tax returns.   (b) Except as provided in SECTION 3.19 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:   (i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have duly and  timely (with due regard to valid extensions properly secured)
filed all  Tax Returns related to Federal income Taxes and all other material
Tax  Returns required to be filed by them prior to the date of this 
Agreement. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all 
material respects as filed (or as validly amended thereafter). Each of  the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has timely (with due regard to  valid
extensions properly secured) paid in full all Taxes it is  required to have
paid, except to the extent of items which have been  adequately reserved
against in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles in the
2001 Company Balance Sheet included in the  Company\'s June 30, 2001 Form
10-Q. The liabilities and reserves for  Taxes reflected in the 2001 Company
Balance Sheet included in the  Company\'s June 30, 2001 Form 10-Q cover all
Taxes for all periods ended  at or prior to the date of such balance sheet
and have been determined  in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and all  Taxes of the Company accrued following the end of the
most recent  period covered by the financial statements included in the
Company\'s  June 30, 2001 Form 10-Q have been accrued in the ordinary course
of  business of the Company and do not materially exceed comparable amounts 
incurred in similar periods in prior years (taking into account any  changes
in the Company\'s operating results).   (ii) The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have at all  times complied in all material respects with
applicable laws pertaining  to Taxes, including, without limitation, all
applicable laws relating  to record retention.   (iii) No Federal income
Tax Return, or material state, local  or foreign Tax Return of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is the  subject of a pending audit or other
administrative proceeding or court  proceeding. Neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries is  aware of any claim by any Tax jurisdiction
that the Company or any  Company Subsidiary has been required to file a Tax
Return, but has  failed to do so. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company  Subsidiaries has requested an extension of time to file any Tax
Return     24   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and
Plan of Merger    not yet filed, nor has been granted any waiver of any
statute of  limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for
the  assessment of, any Tax not yet paid. Neither the Company nor any 
Company Subsidiary has granted a power of attorney that will be  outstanding
on the Closing Date with respect to any material matter  related to Taxes. In
the past two years neither the Company nor any  Company Subsidiary has
entered into any closing agreement with respect  to any Federal income Taxes
or any other material Taxes that has the  effect of materially increasing the
liability for Taxes for any taxable  year of the Company for which Tax
Returns have not been filed.   (iv) All Taxes that were required to be
collected or withheld  by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have
been duly  collected or withheld, and all such Taxes that the Company or any
of  the Company Subsidiaries were required to remit to any taxing authority 
have been duly remitted, except where a failure to collect, withhold or 
remit Taxes does not have a material adverse effect on the Company or  any of
the Company Subsidiaries.   (v) Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is  required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to
Section 481 or  263A of the Code (or similar provisions of other law or
regulation) by  reason of a change in accounting method, nor has the Company
or any of  the Company Subsidiaries received notice that the IRS (or other
taxing  authority) has proposed, or is considering, any such change in 
accounting method. The Company has not taken any action that is not in 
accordance with past practice that could defer a liability for Taxes of  the

have good and marketable (or indefeasible, in jurisdictions where the term
"marketable" is not customarily used in such context) title in fee simple, to
the real property purported to be owned by them, and, upon the exercise of
any options to acquire real property optioned by DHI or any DHI Subsidiary,
DHI or such DHI Subsidiary will have good and marketable (or indefeasible, in
jurisdictions where the term "marketable" is not customarily used in such a
context) title in fee simple to such optioned property, in each case free and
clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances, except liens for Taxes not yet
due and payable and such liens or other encumbrances as do not or will not
materially interfere with the present use or intended use by DHI and the DHI
Subsidiaries or materially affect the value of or the ability to market to
customers the property affected thereby and that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a DHI Material Adverse Effect. DHI and the DHI
Subsidiaries hold valid policies of title insurance issued by reputable title
insurance companies on each parcel of real property owned by them in amounts
equal to the purchase price paid by DHI or such DHI Subsidiary at the time of
its acquisition thereof. Neither DHI nor any DHI Subsidiary has given, nor
have they received, any notice or information indicating that the facts set
forth in any surveys or title insurance policies are untrue or incorrect in
any material respect nor has DHI or the DHI Subsidiaries received any notice
that a breach or an event of default exists, and no condition or event has
occurred that with the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both would
constitute a breach or event of default, by DHI or any DHI Subsidiary, or to
the knowledge of DHI, any other person with respect to any
material contracts, covenants, conditions and restrictions, deeds, deeds of
trust, rights-of-way, easements, mortgages and other documents granting to
DHI or any DHI Subsidiary title to or an interest in or otherwise affecting
the real property which is material to the operation of the business of DHI
and the DHI Subsidiaries, as presently conducted or intended to be conducted,
except for such breach or event of default that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a DHI Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of DHI,
no condemnation, eminent domain, or similar proceeding exists, is pending
or threatened with respect to, or that could affect, any real property owned
or leased by DHI or any DHI Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to
have a DHI Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, injunction, order,
decree, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, moratorium, or other action by
a Governmental Entity, or to the knowledge of DHI, pending before or
being considered by a Governmental Entity, which has or would have the effect
of restricting the conduct of business by DHI or any DHI Subsidiary as
currently conducted or intended to be conducted by them, except for any
restrictions as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a DHI
Material Adverse Effect. No developer-related charges or assessments for off-
site improvements payable to any public authority or any other person for
public improvements are unpaid (other than those reflected on the DHI    
34   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes, Inc.  Agreement and Plan of
Merger   Balance Sheet or incurred since the date of the DHI Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of DHI\'s business consistent with past practices),
except for charges or assessments as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a DHI Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of DHI, there
is no material impediment to obtaining any permits or governmental approvals

SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,

respect to any Third Party Acquisition. The Company shall not, nor shall the

other representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations with or

designees of DHI) concerning, or take any other action designed to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal concerning, any Third Party
Acquisition; provided, however, that (i) nothing herein shall prevent the
Company Board from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to any tender offer or exchange offer; and (ii) the
Company may make inquiry of and participate in discussions with any person or
group who has submitted after the date hereof an unsolicited and unencouraged
Superior Proposal if, and to the extent, the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with and advice from outside legal
counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties and, before making such inquiry or participating in such discussions,
it receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality agreement
with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Letter, which agreement does not provide for any payments
by the Company. The Company shall promptly (but no later than 24 hours
after receipt) notify DHI in the event it receives any proposal or inquiry

foregoing, if the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and advice from outside legal counsel, that it is necessary
to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties, the Company Board may
withdraw or modify its recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or approve or recommend a     39   D.R. Horton, Inc. / Schuler Homes,
Inc.  Agreement and Plan of Merger   Superior Proposal, but in each case
only (i) after providing reasonable written notice to DHI (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising DHI that the Company Board has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
(all in reasonable detail) and (ii) if DHI does not, within three business
days of DHI\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer
which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with a financial adviser of nationally recognized
reputation) to provide as great a value and to be as favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be entitled to enter into any agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless and until this Agreement is terminated by its
terms pursuant to SECTION 7.1. Any disclosure that the Company Board may be
compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a proposal for a Third Party
Acquisition in order to comply with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 will not constitute a
violation of this SECTION 5.2(b); provided that such disclosure states that
no action will be taken by the Company Board with respect to the withdrawal
or modification of its recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or the approval or recommendation of any Third Party Acquisition except in
accordance with this SECTION 5.2(b).   (c) For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition" means the occurrence of any of the
following events: (i) the acquisition of the Company by merger or otherwise
by any person (which includes a "person" as such term is defined in Section

"Third Party"); (ii) the acquisition by a Third Party of all or a substantial
portion of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole; (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of a significant equity
interest in the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether from the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise);
(iv) the adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation or the declaration
or payment of an extraordinary dividend; (v) the repurchase by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of a significant equity interest in the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; or (vi) any other business combination, acquisition,
recapitalization, restructuring or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal to acquire directly
or indirectly for consideration consisting of cash or securities more than
50% of the voting power of Company Shares then outstanding or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company and otherwise on terms which the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consulting with a
financial adviser of nationally recognized reputation) (1) to be from a Third
Party that is financially capable of completing the transaction subject to
the proposal and (2) to provide (if completed) greater value and to be more
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger.  5.3 CONDUCT OF
BUSINESS BY DHI PENDING THE MERGER. DHI covenants and agrees that, during the

in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of DHI Common
Stock;   (c) acquire (by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock
or assets) any corporation, partnership or other business organization or

securities or property) paid exceeds $350,000,000;   (d) issue any shares
of DHI Common Stock (except pursuant to stock options issued under DHI\'s

issuance); and   (e) take, or agree to take, any of the actions described in
SECTIONS 5.3(a) through (d) above, or any action which would make any of
the representations or warranties of DHI contained in this Agreement untrue

from performing or cause DHI not to perform in any material respect its
covenants hereunder.  5.4 SECTION 341(f) CONSENT. DHI hereby acknowledges

may reasonably request to minimize the Tax consequences to the Surviving
Corporation that may result from the filing by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries of such statements of consent, and the acceptance of
such statements of consent by DHI, in connection with the Merger.

terminate this  Agreement under this SECTION 7.1(b)(iii) shall not be
available to any  party who has not complied with its obligations under
SECTION 6.11 and  such noncompliance materially contributed to the issuance

its recommendation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the approval or
recommendation of any Third Party Acquisition except in accordance with

and remedies against such other party in respect of such other party\'s
