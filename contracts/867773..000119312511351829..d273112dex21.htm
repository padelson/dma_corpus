provisions for the appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce. The Closing Statements Arbiter will consider only those items and amounts in Seller&#146;s and Purchaser&#146;s respective calculations

the Closing Date Net Cash and/or the Working Capital Adjustment, as the case may be will be based solely on written materials submitted by Seller and Purchaser (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definition of Working Capital and Net Cash
and the formula for determination of the Working Capital Adjustment included herein. The determination of the Closing Statements Arbiter shall be made in writing to Seller and Purchaser and will be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto pursuant to article 1592 of the French Civil Code, except in the case of manifest error (erreur grossi&egrave;re) by the Closing Statements Arbiter (it being specified, for the avoidance of doubt, that any determination of whether a manifest
error exists shall be made pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.9 (Dispute Resolution and Error)). Purchaser and Seller will not otherwise have any right to, and will not otherwise, institute any Action challenging such determination or with respect to the
matters that are the subject of this Section&nbsp;1.3, except that the foregoing will not preclude an Action to enforce such determination. If the Closing Statements Arbiter&#146;s determination of the Working Capital Adjustment is closer to the
amount initially asserted by Purchaser to the Closing Statements Arbiter, then Seller will pay the costs of the Closing Statements Arbiter, otherwise the costs will be borne by Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and Seller will cooperate with and assist
