This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of December 23, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among SunPower Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(" _Purchaser_ "), Total Gas and Power USA, SAS, a _soci ete par actions
simplifiee_ organized under the laws of the Republic of France (" _Seller_ "),
and Total Energie Developpement SAS, a societe par actions simplifiee
organized under the laws of the Republic of France (" _TED_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in Section
1.3 and Section 8.1.

BACKGROUND

 

Tenesol, a French societe anonyme with a share capital of 14,930,000 whose
registered office is at 12/14 Allee du LevantParc dActivite  69890 La
Tour-de-Salvagny, registered with the Commerce and Companies Registry of Lyon
under number 344 584 818 (the " _Company_ "), is a Subsidiary of TED as of the
date hereof. 

It is contemplated that prior to the closing hereunder, Seller will own all of
the Company Capital Stock.

 

The boards of directors of each of Purchaser and Seller have determined that
the Transactions would be advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, have approved this Agreement and the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_.

At the Closing (a) Seller shall sell, assign and transfer to Purchaser all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (the "
_Shares_ "), free and clear of all Encumbrances and (b) Purchaser shall pay
and deliver, or cause to be paid and delivered, to Seller an amount equal to
$165,375,000 (one hundred sixty-five million three hundred seventy five
thousand United States dollars) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase
Price shall be paid in cash at the Closing to Seller by wire transfer to a
bank account of Seller the details (including full IBAN details) of which
shall have been communicated to Purchaser by Seller at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

Section 1.2 _Closing_.

 

The closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place upon the
later of (a) closing date of the Private Placement or (b) three (3) Business
Days after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in
Article V (except for such conditions that by their nature will be satisfied
at Closing) or at such other time as the parties agree in writing. The
Closing shall take place simultaneously at the offices of Jones Day, Silicon
Valley and Salans, Paris or at such other location(s) as the parties agree.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is herein referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3 _Working Capital and Net Cash Adjustment_.

 

(a) Schedule 1.3(a) sets forth an example calculation of Working Capital as of
November 30, 2011, including the components thereof, on the same basis as
such calculation would be required to be made in

 



1  accordance with this Section 1.3 at Closing assuming the Closing occurred on
such date and assuming the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company as of November 30, 2011 delivered to Purchaser before the date hereof
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are accurate in all respects.

(b) Schedule 1.3(b) sets forth an example calculation of Net Cash as of
November 30, 2011, including the components thereof, on the same basis as such
calculation would be required to be made in accordance with this Section 1.3
at Closing assuming the Closing occurred on such date and assuming the
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of November 30,
2011 delivered to Purchaser before the date hereof have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS and are accurate in all respects.

(c) Purchaser shall, within 120 calendar days after the Closing Date, prepare
and deliver to Seller an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of January 31, 2012 or as the parties otherwise mutually agree (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and: (x) a statement setting forth the calculation
of the Working Capital as of the date of the Closing Balance Sheet, including
the components thereof, as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet (the "
_Closing Date Working Capital_ "), (y) a statement setting forth the
calculation of the Net Cash as of the date of the Closing Balance Sheet,
including the components thereof, as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet
(the " _Closing Date Net Cash_ "), and (z) a statement setting forth the
amount of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, including all documentation
necessary for Seller to verify such information. The " _Working Capital
Adjustment_ " shall be determined as follows: (i) the amount (if any) by
which the Net Cash Target exceeds the Closing Date Net Cash shall constitute a
shortfall that shall be paid by Seller to the Company; and (ii) the amount (if
any) by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing Date Working
Capital shall constitute a shortfall that shall be paid by Seller to the
Company in accordance with Section 1.3(e) (the " _Net Working Capital
Shortfall_ "), _provided_ _that_ , the amount (if any) by which the Closing
Date Net Cash exceeds the Net Cash Target shall constitute an excess that
shall be netted against the Net Working Capital Shortfall. The Closing Balance
Sheet will be prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
Companys audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2010 and Schedules 1.3(a) and 1.3(b) and as otherwise
provided therein. Following the delivery of such statements of Closing Date
Net Cash and Closing Date Working Capital, and the Working Capital
Adjustment, Purchaser will provide Seller and Sellers representatives
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company to the extent
necessary to determine the accuracy of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
statements of Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Net Cash, and will
reasonably cooperate with Seller and its representatives in connection with
their determination of the accuracy of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the statements of Closing Date Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Cash and
the Working Capital Adjustment.

(d) Seller will notify Purchaser in writing of any objections to the
statements of Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Net Cash and to
the Working Capital Adjustment or to the Closing Balance Sheet within 30
calendar days after Seller receives the statements of Closing Date Working
Capital, the Closing Date Net Cash and the Working Capital Adjustment and the
Closing Balance Sheet. If Seller does not notify Purchaser of any such
objections by the end of that 30-day period, then the Closing Date Working
Capital, the Closing Date Net Cash, the Working Capital Adjustment and the
Closing Balance Sheet will each be considered final at the end of the last day
of that 30-day period. If Seller does notify Purchaser of any such objections
by the end of that 30-day period and Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve their differences within 30 calendar days thereafter, then Seller and
Purchaser will instruct their respective accountants to use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such disputed items to their mutual
satisfaction and to deliver a final statement of Closing Date Working Capital,
statement of Closing Date Net Cash, Working Capital Adjustment and Closing
Balance Sheet to Seller and Purchaser as soon as possible. If Sellers
accountants and Purchasers accountants are unable to resolve any such
disputed items within 30 calendar days after the expiration of the 30-day
period during which Seller and Purchaser were unable to resolve their
differences, then the remaining disputed items and the value attributable to
them by each of Seller and Purchaser will be submitted to an internationally
recognized accounting firm mutually agreed by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Closing Statements Arbiter_ ") for resolution, and the Closing Statements
Arbiter will be instructed to determine the final Closing Date Working
Capital, Closing Date Net Cash, Working Capital Adjustment and Closing Balance
Sheet as soon as possible and not later than forty

 



2  (40) Business Days after his appointment. If the Parties cannot agree on an
internationally recognized accounting firm independent of the parties hereto,
to act as Closing Statements Arbiter or if such designated Closing Statements
Arbiter is unable to conduct its mission or refuses, either Purchaser or
Seller shall be entitled to request the appointment of such firm by the
International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the provisions for the
appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the International
Chamber of Commerce. The Closing Statements Arbiter will consider only those
items and amounts in Sellers and Purchasers respective calculations of the
Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Net Cash that are identified
as being items and amounts to which Seller and Purchaser have been unable to
agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Closing Statements Arbiter may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. The Closing Statements Arbiters determination of the Closing
Date Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Cash and/or the Working Capital
Adjustment, as the case may be will be based solely on written materials
submitted by Seller and Purchaser (i.e., not on independent review) and on the
definition of Working Capital and Net Cash and the formula for determination
of the Working Capital Adjustment included herein. The determination of the
Closing Statements Arbiter shall be made in writing to Seller and Purchaser
and will be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto pursuant to
article 1592 of the French Civil Code, except in the case of manifest error
(erreur grossiere) by the Closing Statements Arbiter (it being specified, for
the avoidance of doubt, that any determination of whether a manifest error
exists shall be made pursuant to Section 8.9 (Dispute Resolution and Error)).
Purchaser and Seller will not otherwise have any right to, and will not
otherwise, institute any Action challenging such determination or with respect
to the matters that are the subject of this Section 1.3, except that the
foregoing will not preclude an Action to enforce such determination. If the
Closing Statements Arbiters determination of the Working Capital Adjustment
is closer to the amount initially asserted by Purchaser to the Closing
Statements Arbiter, then Seller will pay the costs of the Closing Statements
Arbiter, otherwise the costs will be borne by Purchaser. Each of Purchaser and
Seller will cooperate with and assist the Closing Statements Arbiter to
determine the final Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Net Cash and
the Working Capital Adjustment.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Closing
Date Working Capital, Closing Date Net Cash and the Working Capital Adjustment
in accordance with this Section 1.3 and provided a Working Capital Adjustment
is payable, Seller will wire transfer to the Company immediately available
funds equal to the amount of such Working Capital Adjustment.

(f) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the following
meanings:

 

(i) " _Working Capital_ " means the Current Assets minus the Current
Liabilities (an example calculation of which, assuming the Closing occurred
on November 30, 2011 and assuming the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of November 30, 2011 delivered to Purchaser
before the date hereof have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and
are accurate in all respects, is attached hereto as Schedule 1.3(a)).

(ii) " _Net Cash_ " means Cash and Cash Equivalents minus the Company
Indebtedness (an example calculation of which, assuming the Closing occurred
on November 30, 2011 and assuming the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of November 30, 2011 delivered to Purchaser
before the date hereof have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are
accurate in all respects, is attached hereto as Schedule 1.3(b)).

(iii) " _Current Assets_ " means without duplication, the sum of the Companys
consolidated receivables ( _cr eances clients_), net inventory ( _stocks_ ),
other receivables ( _autres cr eances_) including prepaid charges,
translation adjustment and deferred tax assets; all as determined in
accordance with IFRS using the same method and methodologies that were used in
the preparation of the Companys audited consolidated financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and otherwise as described in
Schedule 1.3(a).

 



3 (iv) " _Cash and Cash Equivalents_ " means any cash and short term
securities (disponibilites et valeurs mobilieres de placement); all as
determined in accordance with IFRS using the same method and methodologies
that were used in the preparation of the Companys audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and
otherwise as described in Schedule 1.3(a).

(v) " _Current Liabilities_ " means without duplication, the sum of the
Companys consolidated account payables ( _fournisseurs_ ), social debts (
_dettes sociales_ ), fiscal debts ( _dettes fiscales_ ), current accounts (
_comptes courants_ ), other debts ( _autres dettes courantes_ ) and provision
on deferred tax liabilities ( _imp ots differes passifs_); all as determined
in accordance with IFRS using the same method and methodologies that
were used in the preparation of the Companys audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and otherwise as
described in Schedule 1.3(a); _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt
Company Indebtedness will not be included in Current Liabilities.

(vi) " _Net Cash Target_ " means 25,500,000. 

(vii) " _Working Capital Target_ " means 76,000,000.

(x) unless and until Losses have been incurred, paid or properly accrued in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement in an aggregate amount greater
than 3,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ , provided that (i) for the
purposes of meeting the Indemnification Threshold all Losses otherwise giving
right to indemnification (subject to the threshold set forth in Section 7.3(b)
below and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.3(c) below) shall be
included, and (ii) once the Indemnification Threshold has been exceeded, the
Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover for all such Losses from the
first euro, subject to this Article VII; and (y) it being specified that the
total aggregate amount of indemnification of Seller hereunder shall not
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price, as the case may be,
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Indemnification
Cap_ "), provided that to the extent such indemnifiable Losses include Losses
arising with respect to a breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.15(c)(i) (Compliance with Laws; Certain
Business Practices), the Indemnification Cap shall be 

 



29  increased by the amount of Losses attributable to any breach or inaccuracy
under such sub-section up to a maximum amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of
the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Indemnified
Persons will be entitled to recover for, and the Indemnification Threshold and
Indemnification Cap will not apply to, any Losses with respect to any breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in Section 2.1
(Organization and Power), Section 2.2(a), (b) and (f) (Capitalization; Title
to Shares; Subsidiaries), Section 2.3 (Authorization; Enforceability), Section
2.10 (Taxes), Section 2.13 (Related Party Transactions), and Section 2.22

amount of indemnification shall not in any event exceed the total amount of
the Purchase Price, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions set forth
in this Agreement (except in case of fraud or intentional misconduct ("fraude"
or "dol")).

 

(b) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assert any Liability Claim for
Losses under Section 7.1(a)(i) or as specifically provided in Section 7.3(c)
with respect to any individual item or matter, or items or matters arising out
of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless the amount of Losses
with respect to such item(s) or matter(s) exceeds 100,000.

(c) In addition to the limitations in Section 7.3(a) and (b) with respect to
Liability Claims under Section 7.1(a)(i): (A) Liability Claims for Losses
under clauses (ii), (iv), (vi) and (x) of Section 7.1(a) shall be subject to
the threshold described in Section 7.3(b), (B) Liability Claims for Losses
under clauses (ii) and (x) of Section 7.1(a) shall be subject to the
Indemnification Threshold, (C) Liability Claims for Losses under clauses (ii),
(iv), (vi) and (x) of Section 7.1(a) shall be subject to the Indemnification
Cap; (D) Liability Claims for Losses under clauses (iii), (v), (vii), (viii)
and (ix) of Section 7.1(a) shall, together with all other Liability Claims
under this Article VII, not exceed the total amount of the Purchase Price;
and (E) no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assert any Liability Claim
for Losses under clause (viii) or (ix) of Section 7.1(a) with respect to any
individual matter unless the amount of Losses with respect to such matter
exceeds 500,000 (in which case no Liability Claim shall be asserted or
payable in respect of the amount of Losses up to such 500,000 threshold).

(d) Seller shall not be liable hereunder to the extent a Liability Claim is
based on a matter specifically reserved (up to the amount of such reserve) in
the Financial Statements or that will be reserved in the consolidated balance
sheet and income statement of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2011 and that are taken into account in the determination of the Working
Capital Adjustment and as specifically described in the Introduction to the
Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Any deficiency assessed by the tax authorities whose effect is solely to
shift a Tax liability from one fiscal year to another shall not give rise to
indemnification by Seller.

(f) Any indemnification due by an indemnifying party shall be calculated by
taking into account the effect of any related Tax savings actually received
and benefiting to the Indemnified Person; which for the purposes of any
indemnification payment to Purchaser or the Company or its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be the effective tax rate of Purchaser for the year such
indemnification payment is received.

(g) Any amounts actually received by an Indemnified Person under insurance
policies or any other amount compensating the Loss for which the Liability
Claim is made shall be deducted (net of any cost of recovery and any related
retroactive premium adjustments or the net present value in any related future
premium adjustment). If an indemnifying party pays an indemnity in respect of
a Loss and the Indemnified Person subsequently recovers all or part of the
amount of such indemnity from a third party (including insurance companies),
such Indemnified Person, promptly upon recovery thereof, shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to the indemnifying party the amount thereby recovered.

 

(h) Any Loss incurred shall be indemnified only once, notwithstanding the fact
that the event giving rise to the indemnifying partys obligation may
originate from an inaccuracy of several of the representations and warranties
made under Article II hereof or from one or more other provisions of this
Agreement.

 



30 (i) If a Liability Claim is based upon a liability which is contingent only,
no indemnification shall be due unless and until such liability becomes due
and payable.

(j) An Indemnified Person suffering a Loss indemnifiable hereunder shall
take, and shall cause its subsidiaries to take, all commercially reasonable
actions to mitigate any Losses indemnifiable by another party hereunder.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event an Indemnified Person or its
subsidiaries is entitled to recover from a third party any sum which could be
the subject of a Liability Claim, such Indemnified Person shall or shall cause
its subsidiaries to take all reasonable steps in order to enforce its
rights against the relevant third party; provided that such Indemnified
Person shall not be required to take, or refrain from taking, any action
outside the ordinary course of business and nothing herein shall excuse an
indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations hereunder unless and
until the Indemnified Person shall actually have recovered any amount from the
relevant third party.

(k) Seller will not have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or
other right or remedy against Purchaser or the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which Seller may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

(l) Purchasers rights under this Article VII shall not be adversely affected
by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired or capable of being

31  made by Seller in this Agreement (other than Sections 4.1 and 4.2 to which
this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedy), fraud or intentional
misconduct ("fraude" or "dol"), and Purchaser hereby waives any rights to
rescission it may have.

Section 7.6 _Claims for Indemnification_.

At any time that an Indemnified Person discovers an event which it believes
would reasonably be expected to result in a Loss and desires to claim a Loss
under Article VII (a " _Liability Claim_ "), Purchaser will deliver a notice
of such Liability Claim (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to Seller within thirty (30)
Business Days (other than in respect of possible third-party claims pursuant
to Section 7.8 below) of the date on which Purchaser shall have determined
that such event would reasonably be expected to result in a Loss. A Claims
Notice will (A) be signed by an officer of Purchaser, (B) describe the
Liability Claim in reasonable detail and (C) indicate the amount (estimated,
if necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be
paid, suffered, sustained or accrued by the Indemnified Persons. To the
extent that the amount of a Loss is not determinable as of the date of
delivery of a Claims Notice, Purchaser may deliver a Claims Notice stating the
maximum amount of Loss that Purchaser in good faith estimates or anticipates
that an Indemnified Person may pay or suffer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchasers provision of an estimated or anticipated amount of Loss will not
limit the Loss recoverable or recovered by an Indemnified Person. No delay in
or failure to give a Claims Notice by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this
Section 7.4 will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that
Purchaser has under this Agreement or alter or relieve Seller of its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article
VII, except and to the extent that such delay or failure has prejudiced
Seller. Seller shall be entitled to make all necessary investigations
regarding such event and Purchaser shall provide Seller reasonable access to
all documents and persons necessary to carry out such investigation, provided
that Seller shall keep confidential any such documentation and information and
subject to any privilege of Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries in
respect thereto. In the event a claim is brought by Seller against Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) hereunder, the terms of Sections 7.6, 7.7, 7.8 and
7.9 shall apply as if Purchaser were Seller thereunder, and Seller were the
Indemnified Persons, _mutatis mutandis_.

Section 7.7 _Objections to, and Payment of, Claims_.

 

(a) Seller may object to any Liability Claim set forth in such Claims Notice
by delivering written notice to Purchaser of Sellers objection (an "
_Objection Notice_ "). Such Objection Notice must describe the grounds for
such objection in reasonable detail (and such grounds may include not having
been able to conduct or complete its investigation as provided above).

(b) If an Objection Notice is not delivered by Seller to Purchaser within 45
days after delivery by Purchaser of the Claims Notice, such failure to so
object will be an irrevocable acknowledgment by each party to this Agreement
that the Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1
for the Losses set forth in such Claims Notice in accordance with this
Article VII.

(c) If the Claims Notice was delivered by Seller and no Objection Notice was
delivered to Purchaser within 45 days of the delivery of the Claims Notice,
or an Objection Notice was delivered to Purchaser within 45 days of the
delivery of the Claims Notice, but such Objection Notice states that it was,
or admits liability, only with respect to a portion of the Losses claimed in
the Claims Notice, Seller will deliver to Purchaser as soon as practicable
cash having a value equal to (1) the amount of the Losses set forth in such
Claims Notice, if no Objection Notice was delivered to Purchaser, or (2) the
amount of the portion of the Losses set forth in such Claims Notice to which
no objection was made, if an Objection Notice was delivered to Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent that the amount of the Losses
set forth in the Claims Notice (or portion thereof) is an estimate, Purchaser
(on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) will not be so entitled
to receive, and Seller will not be required to deliver, funds in respect of
such portions of such estimated Losses unless and until the amount of such
estimated Losses is finally determined.

 



32 Section 7.8 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

 

(a) If Seller objects in writing to any Liability Claim made in any Claims
Notice within 45 days after delivery of such Claims Notice, Seller and
Purchaser will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each such claim. If Seller and Purchaser
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared
and signed by both parties. Seller will promptly, and in no event later than
five Business Days after Seller and Purchasers entering into such memorandum,
wire transfer to Purchaser immediately available funds equal to the amount of
cash agreed to be delivered to Purchaser in the memorandum.

(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good-faith negotiation and after
30 days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either Purchaser or Seller may
bring an Action against the other to resolve the dispute in accordance with
Section 8.9.

Section 7.9 _Third-Party Claims_.

(a) If Purchaser receives written notice of a third-party claim which
Purchaser believes would reasonably be expected to result in a Loss, Purchaser
will notify Seller of such third-party claim with reasonable promptness and in
any case no later than twenty (20) Business Days (ten (10) Business Days with
regard to Tax matters) after Purchaser or the Company becomes aware of the
occurrence of the event or circumstances giving rise to the claim, or within a
shorter period if the circumstances so demands (in particular with regard to
Tax matters or if urgent action is required). This notification shall include
a full and complete copy of any document received from the third-party and any
other supporting material relevant to the assessment of the third-party
claim in the possession of Purchaser that can readily be provided. Purchaser
shall provide Seller the opportunity to take part at its own cost in, but not
direct or conduct, any defense of such claim Seller may request that counsel
of its choice be involved at its expense in the proceeding alongside counsel
to the Company and/or Purchaser. Seller and its counsel will have access to
any documentation and information required in connection with the proceeding,
provided that they shall keep confidential any such documentation and
information and subject to any privilege of Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect thereto. However, no settlement of any kind shall be
agreed upon without the prior written consent of Seller. If Seller consents
to any such settlement, Seller will not have any power or authority to object
to the amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person for indemnity with respect to such settlement. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, all reasonable costs and expenses of
defense and investigation, including court costs and reasonable attorneys
fees incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Persons in connection with the
defense of any such third-party claim, will constitute Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 7.1.

(b) The following provisions shall apply in respect of the SunR Litigation,
Q-Cells Litigation or any litigation arising out of the matters to which
Section 7.1(a)(viii) relates (collectively, the " _Covered Litigation_ ") and,
in the event Seller determines based on future developments in connection
with any of the litigation described in Section 2.7 of the Disclosure
Schedule, and provided in respect thereof Seller agrees to fully indemnify the
Company in such case against any Liability Claim(s) in respect thereto (or as
otherwise agreed by the parties), in respect of such relevant Liability Claims
(the " _Other Litigation Claims_ "). In respect of the SunR Litigation, and
within thirty (30) Business Days of serving notice on the Purchaser and the
Company of its election to do so in respect of any litigation arising out of
the matters to which Section 7.1(a)(ix) relates and/or any Other Litigation
Claims, Seller shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such Covered
Litigation and/or Other Litigation Claims on its own and at its own expense
(which right to conduct said defense shall include the right to control and
conduct any discussions or negotiations with any party in respect thereof).
In the event of such Seller election, Purchaser shall, or shall procure that
the Company and/or the relevant Subsidiary shall, present all arguments,
submit all pleadings, take all actions, file all counterclaims and
more generally cooperate with Seller and the counsel appointed by Seller. In
the event of such Seller election, Purchaser shall provide, and shall cause
the Company and/or the relevant Subsidiary to provide to Seller all
information or documents in relation to such litigation and related claims
which Seller may reasonably request. In the event of

 



33  such Seller election, Purchaser, the Company and/or the relevant Subsidiary
shall be entitled to retain counsel, at their own expense, to assist in the
defense of any claims that Purchaser elects to defend pursuant to this
Section 7.9(b). Seller shall consult with Purchaser, the Company and/or the
relevant Subsidiary about any strategic decision made in connection with the
proceedings undertaken for the purpose of defending the interests of
Purchaser, the Company and/or the relevant Subsidiary pursuant to such Seller
election hereunder. Seller shall be entitled to enter into any settlement of
any claims in respect of such litigations that Seller elects to defend
pursuant to this Section 7.9(b). Unless and until Seller exercises its right
under this sub-section in respect of the Q-Cells Litigation and the Other
Litigation Claims, Purchaser shall be entitled to such rights as it would have
as if such Q-Cells Litigation or Other Litigation Claims were third-party
claims governed by Section 7.9(a).

Section 7.10 _Seller Obligation to Collect from Collateral Sources_.

Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to seek indemnification
for the benefit of Purchaser from all applicable third party sources
(including insurance companies, affiliates or any former stockholders of the
Company) with obligations to indemnify Seller in respect of any Losses which
may be suffered by Purchaser or the Company, whether or not such Losses would
be recoverable hereunder absent the existence of such third party sources.

 

Section 7.11 _Indemnification Payments to the Company._

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification payment made hereunder to the
Company shall not be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 8.4 _Severability_.

 

If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application of any such term
or provision to any Person or circumstance is held by final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or arbiter to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. If the final judgment of such court or arbitrator declares that any
term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree
to, replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the original intention of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision.

Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement_.

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related Agreements and the
documents, instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, including all exhibits and
schedules hereto and thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, term sheets, letters of interest, correspondence (including
e-mail) and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, with respect to the subject
matter hereof, being specified that the Confidentiality Agreement, which will
continue in full force and effect, and will survive any termination of this
Agreement, in accordance with its terms.

Section 8.6 _Assignment_.

Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation under this
Agreement may be assigned by any party to this Agreement by operation of Law
or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement and any attempt to do so will be void. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may assign all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement (1) before, to any of its Affiliates as long as any such
Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and
provisions contained in this Agreement, but no such assignment will relieve
Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement if such assignee does not
perform such obligations and (2) after the Closing, in the event that
Purchaser transfers all its shares in the Company to any Affiliates, as long
as such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms,
conditions and provisions contained in this Agreement, but no such assignment
or delegation will relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement
if such assignee does not perform such obligations, and provided that such
assignment is notified in writing to Seller.

 

Section 8.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

Except as provided in Article VII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

of France, excluding any choice of law rules that may direct the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 8.9 _Dispute Resolution and Venue_.

 

In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with or relating
to this Agreement, the parties agree to submit the matter to settlement
proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce ADR Rules. If the
dispute has not been settled pursuant to the said Rules within 45 days
following the filing of a Request for ADR or within such other period as the
parties may agree in writing, such dispute shall be finally settled under the

mediation or arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland. The language in which

mediation and arbitral proceedings.

 

Section 8.10 _Number of originals_.

This Agreement shall be executed in three or more originals, one for each
party. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission
or email attachment, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or email-
attached signature page were an original thereof.
