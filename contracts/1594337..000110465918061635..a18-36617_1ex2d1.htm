reserves the right (but is not obligated to) at any time and from time to time
in its sole discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or

subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or amend the terms of the
CVR or the CVR Agreement, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or

Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, (v) extend or otherwise change the Offer
Expiration Time (except as required or permitted by the other provisions of
this Agreement), (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or

14d-1(g)(3)). Subject to the parties respective rights to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer
for any period required by any applicable rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof or Nasdaq (including in order to
comply with Exchange Act Rule 14e-1(b) in respect of any change in the Offer
Price) or as may be necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or the staff
or Nasdaq, in each case, as applicable to the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 or the
Offer Documents; and

 



 

(ii) if, as of any then-scheduled Offer Expiration Time, any Offer Condition
is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub (to the
extent permitted hereunder), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of
up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer or shorter period as the
parties hereto may agree) in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer
Conditions;

 



 

 _provided_ , that, without the Companys written consent, Merger Sub shall
not extend the Offer, and without Parents prior written consent, Merger Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer, in each case beyond the earlier of
the End Date or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with

Expiration Time (the time of such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ")
and (ii) promptly after (in any event, no more than two (2) Business Days
after) the Offer Acceptance Time, pay (subject to any applicable withholding
tax) for such Shares. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and
subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the
Offer, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in
connection with any extension of the Offer expressly permitted by _Section
2.01(c)_. Any such delay in payment shall be effected in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer

conditions of the Offer.

 



 

(e) _Termination of the Offer_. Parent and Merger Sub may not terminate the
Offer prior to the Offer Expiration Time (as it may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Agreement), unless and until this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_. In the event that
this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, prior to any
scheduled expiration thereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of such
termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer

tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof in accordance with
Applicable Law.

and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares as

and any other Applicable Law, including by setting the Stockholder List Date

violation of its obligations set forth in this sentence if it has used
reasonable efforts to prepare the Schedule 14D-9 on an expeditious basis
following the date of this Agreement, and is prepared to file with the SEC the
Schedule 14D-9 no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish the Company with all

published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue

event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
and (y) from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent, with a list of

parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10153, unless another place

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, including Section
251(h) thereof, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,

or the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_, _Section 2.05(c)_, or
_Section 2.07_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

respect thereto; and

 



 

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the

Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Paymen_ _t_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer,
Parent shall appoint Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company as the paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Merger
Consideration to each holder of a Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with this _Section 2.06_. As promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares that are converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.05(a)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required to make prompt payment of any outstanding
Merger Consideration to be paid in exchange for Shares converted in the Merger
pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that
it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.
The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by

 



      
 

 



 

the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.05(a)_, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that delivery of the Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the certificate
representing the Shares (the " _Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include references to
effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section 2.12_ or to book-
entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares, as applicable)
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (after due consultation with the Company)
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time) for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration for each
Share.

 



 

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate
promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of the Certificate (
_provided_ , _however_ , that delivery of a book-entry statement shall not be
required in respect of any uncertificated Shares held of record in book-
entry), together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of the exchange of book-entry Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred each such Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of any Certificate is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall either pay to
the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment being made to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) _No Other Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of transfers
of Shares on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall
be given a copy of a letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the
instructions therein in order to receive the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares or any
Certificates except to receive, upon surrender of a Certificate pursuant to
and in accordance with this _Section 2.06_, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Share represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein
or by Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares at any time following the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall
subject to abandoned property, escheat or other Applicable Laws thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to _Section 2.11_) as general
creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand appraisal and who has properly exercised and perfected a
demand for appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such
holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL with respect to such
Shares (any such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall
provide Parent with prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice and/or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, or if required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

 



 

Section 2.08. _Vested Company Stock Options; Vested Company RSUs; Unvested
Company Stock Options; Company ESPP_.

 



 

(a) _Vested Company Stock Options and Vested Company RSUs_. At the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares that is vested and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Vested Company Stock
Option_ ") and each vested restricted stock unit corresponding to Shares that
has not yet settled (each, a " _Vested Company RSU_ ") shall terminate and be
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and be converted into
the right to receive the Option Consideration and/or RSU Consideration (as
applicable), if any, with respect to such Vested Company Stock Option or
Vested Company RSU. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing Amount does not
exceed the exercise price payable in respect of each Share issuable under such
Vested Company Stock Option, a Vested Company Stock Option shall be terminated
and the holder thereof shall not be entitled to the any Option Consideration
in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) _Unvested Company Stock Options and Unvested Restricted Stock Units_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not assume any
option to purchase Shares that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, an " _Unvested Company Option_ ") or any unvested
restricted stock units corresponding to Shares (each, an " _Unvested Company
RSU_ ").

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU held by a Continuing
Employee or Continuing Consultant that is unexpired, outstanding and has not
yet

 



       
 

 



 

been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
_Section 2.10_, shall be converted into and substituted for the right to
receive the applicable Unvested RSU Consideration from Parent for such
Unvested Company RSU in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.8(b)_.

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for
any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company
Option held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Consultant that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.10_, shall be converted into and
substituted for the right to receive the Unvested Option Consideration from
Parent for such Unvested Company Option in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 2.8(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Unvested Consideration (Option/RSU)_. The cash payment
pursuant to _Section 2.08(b)_ for Unvested Company Options and Unvested
Company RSUs shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting
arrangements (including all provisions with respect to the acceleration of
vesting following the Effective Date that would apply if such awards were
assumed by Parent, including pursuant to applicable award agreements,
employment agreements or severance agreements (collectively, " _Employment
Offer Documents_ ") that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or
Unvested Company RSUs as of the Effective Time by virtue of _Section
2.08(b)_. Therefore, the Unvested Consideration (Option/RSU) shall not be
payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by
Parent on the date that such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs
would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such awards
at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such
vesting schedule and giving effect to all applicable terms with respect to the

(i) complied as to form with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
applicable thereto, as of their respective filing dates with the SEC, in all
material respects, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved and (iii) fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company as of the dates
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of the

Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (the effect of
which would not be material, individually or in the aggregate) and the absence
of notes (which notes, if presented, would not differ materially from those
presented in the Audited Financial Statements). As of the date hereof, there
are no material changes to the Unaudited Financial Statements. As of September
30, 2018, the Companys cash balance was approximately $70 million.

 



 

(b) The Company maintains, and since September 30, 2015 has maintained, a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Financial Statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being

 



      
 

 



 

made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of
Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets
of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that
assessment concluded that those controls were effective and disclosed to the
Companys independent public accounting firm and audit committee of the
Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Since September 30, 2015, neither the Company nor, to the Companys Knowledge,
the Companys independent registered public accounting firm has identified or
been made aware of any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as
such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in
the design or operation of such internal control over financial reporting
utilized by the Company that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees of the Company who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Each of the Companys chief
executive officer and chief financial officer believe they will be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



 

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that (i) all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management or to
other individuals responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 



 

(d) Since September 30, 2015, to the Companys Knowledge, the Company has not
received or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the

Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not a party to, or otherwise
obligated under, any Contract, plan or program that provides for the gross-up

Section 5.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions do not and will not
(i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 5.03_,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Applicable Law or Order or (iii) require any consent or approval under,
violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit
under, constitute a change of control or default under, or result in
termination or cancellation or give to others any right of termination,
vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation (in each case, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) of any Contract to which Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent is a party, or by which they or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, with
such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, as would
not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Capitalization and Operation of Merger Sub_. As of the date of
this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which shares are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged
in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or
obligations other than as contemplated hereby or otherwise incidental or
ancillary to the Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.06. _No Vote of Parent Stockholders; Required Approval_. No vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent or
the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is
necessary to adopt this Agreement or the CVR Agreement, or to approve the
Merger or the other Transactions. The vote or consent of Parent or a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub is the only
vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement and the
CVR Agreement, which vote shall be taken or consent shall be given immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.07. _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will,
at the time such document is first filed with the SEC, at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to
the holders of Shares, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are being
made, not misleading. The Offer Documents and each document required to be
filed by Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC in connection with the Offer will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company
in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.

 



 

Section 5.08. _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no
Proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of Parent, overtly threatened
against, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order, which in either case,
has had or if resolved adversely would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and
complete copy of a fully executed commitment letter dated on or about the date
of this Agreement (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") from Gurnet Point L.P. (the "
_Sponsor_ "), providing for an equity investment in

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, in cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been
amended or modified, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated,
and none of the respective obligations and commitments contained in such
letters have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and no
such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated. As of the date
hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements (whether written or oral) to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letter and (ii) the satisfaction of the Offer
Conditions, the net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter will, in
the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
pay the Merger Consideration, the amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.08 and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related Expenses payable on
the Closing Date by them in connection with the Transactions (such amount
collectively, the " _Aggregate Commitment_ "). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter is (x) legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent, each
of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and each of the
other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Law affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity and (z) in full force and effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub or any other parties thereto under the Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IVI, and
the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, Parent has no reason to believe that
the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub at the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective controlled Affiliates "owns," and at all times
since the date of incorporation of the Company none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective controlled Affiliates has "owned," beneficially or
otherwise (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL), any of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than passive investments for
cash management purposes or employee benefit plans established or maintained
for the benefit of Parent or its controlled Affiliates employees in the
ordinary course of business). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, or since the
date of incorporation of the Company has been, an "interested stockholder" of
the Company under Section 203(c) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 5.11. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _ARTICLE 5_, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates nor any other Person on
behalf of any of them is making or has made any express or implied
representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, including with
respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with
respect to any other information provided, or made available, to the Company
or any of its Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions, including the accuracy or completeness thereof, and Parent and
Merger Sub hereby expressly disclaim any such other representations or
warranties. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement (as
qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedules), neither the Company nor any other Company Related Party is making
or has made any representations or warranties, expressed or implied, at law or
in equity, with respect to or on behalf of the Company, their businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or
completeness of any

 



      
 

 



 

information regarding the Company or any other matter furnished or provided to
Parent or Merger Sub or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub are not relying and
specifically disclaim that they are relying upon or have relied upon any such
other representations or warranties that may have been made by any Person, and
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates have specifically
disclaimed and do hereby specifically disclaim any such other representations
and warranties. Parent and Merger Sub have conducted their own independent
investigation of the Company and the Transactions and have had an opportunity
to discuss and ask questions regarding the Company with the management of the
Company.

Agreement until the Offer Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit and shall direct its Representatives not to, directly

facilitate or knowingly cooperate with the making of any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that could reasonably be

response to an inquiry from a Third Party that was not solicited in violation

and cause to be terminated any solicitation and any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for information that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal
and (B) terminate access by any Third Party to any physical or electronic data
room relating to any potential Acquisition Transaction. Within three (3)
Business Days of the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall request
the prompt return or destruction of any confidential information provided to
any such Third Party or any of its Representatives and from any other Person
to whom confidential information was provided in connection with a proposed
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any
standstill provision or similar provision that has the effect of prohibiting
the counterparty thereto from making a private Acquisition Proposal to the
Company Board; in each case, to the extent the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time the Company receives a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of
this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_), and
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 6.02_, do any or all of the following: (i) furnish any information
with respect to the Company to any Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any such information, the
Company receives (or has received) from such Third Party and provides to
Parent a copy of an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any
such non-public information so furnished has been previously provided or made
available to Parent or is provided or made available (including through the
Data Room) to Parent promptly (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after it is so furnished) to such Third Party or (ii) participate or
engage in negotiations or discussions with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that any action that, if taken by the Company
would be a breach of the provisions set forth in this _Section 6.02_ is taken
by any Representative of the Company (or, solely for purposes of Section
6.02(e) and the first sentence of this Section 6.02(b) the Principal
Stockholder), such action shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.02_ by the Company.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) fail to make, withhold or withdraw (or
modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or
propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Board Recommendation (it being
understood that failing to recommend the rejection of any Acquisition Proposal
that is a tender offer or exchange offer and reaffirming the Board
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer shall be considered an adverse modification),
(B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) after public
announcement of an Acquisition Proposal (other than in connection with the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer), fail to publicly reaffirm
and confirm that the Company Board has not changed the Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after a written request by Parent to do so (or,
if earlier, by the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding
the scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance Time); _provided_ , that Parent may
only make such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that has
not been amended with respect to financial or other material terms, or (D)
fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when

 



      
 

 



 

disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or enter into, any Contract, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.02_, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may
make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Applicable Law, (ii) (A) the Company shall have provided Parent five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to make a Change in
Recommendation prior to making any such Change in Recommendation, which notice
shall describe the reasons therefore and the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail (provided, that such notice shall not constitute a Change in
Recommendation) and (B) if requested by Parent in good faith, during such five
(5) Business Day period after providing such notice, negotiate (and direct its
Representatives to negotiate) in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
or another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that a Change in
Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (iii) after giving effect to
all revisions and proposals contemplated by the foregoing clause (ii), if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith that failure to make the Change in Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any material change in any
event, occurrence or facts relating to such Intervening Event (other than in
respect to any revisions proposed or proposals made by Parent as referred to
above), a new notice shall be required from the Company pursuant to _Section
6.02(d)(ii)_, except that the references to five (5) Business Days in this
_Section 6.02(d)_ shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days, and the
provisions of this _Section 6.02(d)_ shall otherwise apply to the Intervening
Event as modified thereby.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.02_, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time if, in response to a
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement
and not withdrawn that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_,
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that (i) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company
Board to make a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then (A) subject to
compliance with _Section 6.02(f)_, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation and (B) subject to the Companys compliance with _Section
8.01(d)(i)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to such
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 6.02(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_, unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent five (5)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "),
which notice shall not constitute a Change in Recommendation, advising Parent
that the Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons for such action and the material terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal) and providing Parent with a copy of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant documents for such
Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into (provided that Parent shall
be required to keep all such documents and their terms confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement), and (y):

 



      
 

 



 

(i) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and
any other proposals made by Parent intended by Parent to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any and all
adjustments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof)
and any other agreements that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the "
_Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on
the fifth (5th) Business Day of such five (5) Business Day period and shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that the Acquisition Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be
given effect, and that the failure to make the Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under Applicable Law.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of a
Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the
references to five (5) Business Days in this _Section 6.02(f)_ shall be
deemed to be three (3) Business Days.

 



 

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the
Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request
for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an
Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, provide to Parent in
writing within twenty-four (24) hours the terms and conditions (including the
identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal), other than
immaterial terms and conditions, of any such Acquisition Proposal as well as
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request. The Company shall (i)
keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status
and details and terms (other than immaterial details and terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including, prior to furnishing any information or to
participating in any discussions or negotiations pursuant to _Section
6.02(b),_ advising Parent of any determination by the Company Board pursuant
to _Section 6.02(b)_) and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
terms and conditions (other than immaterial terms and conditions) thereof and
(ii) promptly provide to Parent (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt or delivery thereof) any written proposal, indication of
interest (or amendment thereto) or any other written material that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment thereto) including copies of any
proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any financing commitments
related thereto.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company that the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required by
Applicable Law and the failure of the Company Board to comply therewith would
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that this _Section 6.02(h)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change in
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 6.02(d)  (f)_ and
any disclosure contemplated by clause (i) or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) shall be deemed a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board
expressly reaffirms the Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

 



 

(i) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement (i) containing terms that are, in the aggregate, no less restrictive
of, or in the aggregate more favorable to, the Third Party that is party to
such agreement and its Affiliates and Representatives than the terms set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives and (ii) that does not prohibit the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with _Section 6.02_ or otherwise prohibit
the Company from complying with its obligations under _Section 6.02._

 



 

(ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, indication of interest,
offer or proposal, including any amendment or modification to any existing
inquiry, indication of interest, offer or proposal (other than, in each case,
any inquiry, indication of interest, offer or proposal made or submitted by or
on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or one or more of their controlled
Affiliates), contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Transaction.

 



 

(iii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means, other than the Transactions, any
transaction (including any single- or multi-step transaction) or series of
related transactions with any Person or " _group_ " (as defined in the
Exchange Act) relating to (v) granting an exclusive license to Corplex
Donepezil, Corplex Memantine or Corplex Fingolimod, (w) the issuance to such
Person or " _group_ " or acquisition by such Person or " _group_ " of, or a
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such Person
or " _group_ " beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act), at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding equity
interests in the Company, (x) the acquisition (including by exclusive license)
by such Person or " _group_ " of assets of the Company representing at least
twenty percent (20%) of the fair market value of the assets of the Company, or
to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys net income or net
revenues are derived, in each case of clause (w) and (x), whether pursuant to
a merger (including a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving
corporation), reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender
offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction, (y) the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company or (z) any combination of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an exclusive license to a third party to
Corplex Donepezil, Corplex Memantine or Corplex Fingolimod that is limited to
geographic territories that do not include the United States shall not be
deemed to be an "Acquisition Transaction" for purposes of clause (v) of this
paragraph if Parent shall have consented to discussions with such third party
with respect thereto.

 



 

(iv) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event, occurrence or fact
occurring or arising after the date hereof (other than any event, occurrence
or fact that results from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company

Agreement) that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company
Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any event,
occurrence or fact that relates to (i) an Acquisition Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof or (ii) Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates.

 



 

(v) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ , that for this purpose the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in
the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to
"fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party, that did not result from a
material breach of _Section 6.02_, that the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel), taking into account all of the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (including any offer by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement and any

 



      
 

 



 

other agreements proposed by Parent, including any Proposed Changed Terms) and
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal, that the Company Board considers in good faith to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), is reasonably capable of being consummated in
accordance with its terms and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
that is more favorable to the Companys stockholders (solely in their capacity
as such) from a financial point of view than the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Approval of Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time, without a

its officers, directors, employees and other Representatives to, (i) afford
Parents and Merger Subs officers and Parents and Merger Subs other
authorized Representatives reasonable access as reasonably requested by
Parent, during normal business hours throughout the Pre-Closing Period, to
their respective Representatives, officers, employees, properties, facilities,

and final reports of Deloitte and Touche LLP relating to the 2017 audited
financials as and when furnished to the Company), work papers, correspondence
and any other such assets, documents and information of or relating to the
Company that is in the possession, custody or control of the Company or its

each case, as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers, employees or other
Representatives, may reasonably request, (ii) upon reasonable request from
Parent or Merger Sub, use reasonable efforts to afford Parents and Merger
Subs officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access to the
Companys suppliers and material customers and (iii) promptly furnish Parent
and Merger Sub with a copy of any communication received by the Company from
the SEC concerning compliance with securities laws with respect to matters
unrelated to the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access
shall be conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company. Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information
to Parent if such disclosure would, in the Companys reasonable discretion (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any
Applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding confidentiality obligation of the
Company (so long as the Company has used such reasonable efforts as may be
requested by Parent to make appropriate substitute arrangements, to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Applicable Law, agreement or
duty); _provided_ , _further_ , that information shall be disclosed subject to
the execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure
may be limited to external counsel for Parent, in each case, to the extent
that the Company determines that doing so would permit the disclosure of any
such information without violating any Applicable Laws, including applicable
Antitrust Laws, or jeopardizing any such legal privilege.

 



 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parents or Merger Subs reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each party acknowledges that all information provided to it or any of its
Representatives by the other party or any of such partys Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be deemed to be provided under, and shall be treated in accordance with, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Notice of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other in writing of:

 



 

(a) any written notice or other written communication received by such party
or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent,
approval, permission of or waiver from such party is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions;

 



 

(b) any written notice or other written communication received by such party
or any of its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions;

 



 

(c) the commencement or written threat to commence any Stockholder/Transaction
Litigation or any other Proceeding that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
section of this Agreement; and

 



 

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Annex
A_ or in _ARTICLE 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to
deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall not be considered in
determining whether the conditions set forth on _Annex A_ or in _ARTICLE 7_
have been satisfied;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no notification given by any party pursuant to
this _Section 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in
this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies
contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify such partys
reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or supplement
the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2019, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee (i) base salary and base wages in an amount no less favorable than
that in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and (ii)
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, severance benefits and
other employee benefits (other than equity compensation, long-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities and retention or transaction bonuses)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
and pursuant to the same Company Employee Plans if those arrangements are
listed on Schedule 6.06(a) or otherwise adopted in compliance with _Section
6.01(b)_ (the " _Surviving Company Benefit Plans_ ").

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing Employees,
Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company prior to the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility
to participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals or
participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan
providing post-retirement medical or other similar benefits) and vesting under
each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement of the Surviving Corporation, but solely to the extent that
service was

 



      
 

 



 

credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Company
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent that
such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Surviving
Corporation Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes
eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause each
such Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan to waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
under such Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees
and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
would not have applied or would have been waived under the corresponding
Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a participant
immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such Surviving
Corporation Benefit Plan but only to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of Parents applicable insurance Contracts in effect as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will reasonably cooperate with
Parent to provide updates to the Section 280G Information, if any, following
the date hereof and to provide such other related information as reasonably
requested by Parent.

 



 

(e) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company, as
they may be amended from time to time.

 



 

(f) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.06_ are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan or any
beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section
6.06_ shall be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any Surviving
Corporation Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates to permit any Person to participate in any particular
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan, before or after the
consummation of the Transactions, and any such plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.07. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be applicable to any
Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable efforts
to (i) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and (ii) otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law (or, in the
case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions on business combinations
provided therein) inapplicable to or to minimize the effects of the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.08. _Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.09. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
purchase (in consultation with Parent) a "tail" or "runoff" officers and
directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently
covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for the six
(6) year period following the Closing and at a price not to exceed 300% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Current Premium_ "). If the Company or Parent
obtains prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with this _Section 6.09(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to purchase such "tail" or
"runoff" policy prior to Closing, then either (i) Parent may purchase such
"tail" or "runoff" policy on behalf of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain an officers and directors liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect as
of the date of this Agreement for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time; _provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligation under
this _Section 6.09(a)(ii)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the Current
Premium and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300%
of the Current Premium, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance that, in Parent or the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to each indemnification
agreement that is in effect between the Company and any individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") and was Made
Available to Parent and any indemnification or exculpation provisions set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time through the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, (i)
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Party than are set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any indemnification or exculpation provisions set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date
of this Agreement with respect to acts or omissions by Persons covered by such
provisions and in the capacity covered thereby occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the

 



      
 

 



 

successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her trustees and administrators and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such individual may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws, by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities, the expiry or early termination of any applicable
waiting periods, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of
all steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,
or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the
delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of required consents or
waivers from, Third Parties necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iii)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_, each of Parent and the Company shall prepare and file any
notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable (and, in any event, within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) and shall provide or
cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
information and documentary material that may be requested by the DOJ or FTC
under the HSR Act. Furthermore, each of Parent and Company shall prepare and
file any notification and report forms and related material required by any
other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions (if any), and
any additional filings or notifications and related material that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions, as
promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable and shall provide or cause to
be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
information and documentary material that may be requested by other
Governmental Authorities under applicable Antitrust Laws (if any). Each of
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take such
actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period or other approval of consummation
of the Transactions by the DOJ or FTC or other applicable Governmental
Authorities; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.10_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the parties
hereto understand and agree that Parents reasonable best efforts shall
include Parent (i) entering into a settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement relating to the Company, its business or its assets,
with or required by any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection
with any consent or approval required to complete or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition or hold separate of
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company (a " _Regulatory Action_
"); and, _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require
Parent or its Affiliates to (and the Company shall not without the express
written consent of Parent) take or agree to any Regulatory Action which would
result in or reasonably be likely to result in, either individually or in the
aggregate, a material and adverse Effect on the Companys business. Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the
intention to, or that would reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the
expiration or termination of

 



       
 

 



 

any waiting period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the DOJ
or FTC or under any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(c) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company and Parent and their respective
counsel shall, keep the other party apprised on a reasonably timely basis of
the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional for additional information from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Law and to the extent
practicable, the Company and Parent shall and their respective counsel shall
(i) have the right to review in advance, and each shall consult the other on,
any material filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, (ii) promptly
inform each other of any material communication (or any other material
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or
any other applicable Governmental Authority and (iii) promptly furnish each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings and written
communications between them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Transactions. To the extent reasonably practicable,
neither party shall agree to participate in any meeting, or engage in any
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such material
meeting or conversation. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 6.10_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.10_,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning: (i) the valuation of the Company; (ii) competitively
sensitive information; (iii) so as not to jeopardize attorney-client,
attorney-work product, or any other applicable privileges; or (iv) so as not
to contravene any Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) All filing fees required in connection with any filings with any
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority shall be borne by Parent, and each party shall be
responsible for any of its own respective costs and expenses incurred by such
party (including attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses) associated
with the preparation of its portion of any such filings.

 



 

(e) Neither party shall, without the prior written consent of the other party,
extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any
Antitrust Law or enter into any Contract with any Governmental Authority to
delay or not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and to any applicable sections of
this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties
will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Stockholder/Transaction Litigation_. Each party hereto shall
notify the other party, in writing and promptly after acquiring knowledge
thereof, of any Stockholder/Transaction Litigation related to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby that is brought
against or, to the Knowledge of such party, threatened against, such party,
its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors or officers and
shall keep the other party informed on a reasonably current basis with respect
to the status thereof. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in the defense
and settlement of any such litigation, and the Company shall not settle any
such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement does not
involve the payment of any amounts, or the admission of any wrongdoing.
Without

 



      
 

 



 

limiting in any way the parties obligations under _Section 6.10_, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by
this _Section 6.11_, it being understood that the Company shall control the
defense of any Stockholder/Transaction Litigation, but shall consult with
Parent in the conduct thereof.

 



 

Section 6.12. _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a
joint press release, in a form mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, and
shall be issued as promptly as practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any other press release, or scheduling a press conference
or conference call with investors or analysts, and shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to consult with each other before making any other public
statement, in each case with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except for any such release or
announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing rules of

of its personnel or advisors shall be required to provide any such assistance
which would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company

required to provide or prepare projections or similar forward-looking
information (it being understood and agreed that the Company shall provide any

requested by Parent that is necessary for Parent to prepare any projections or
similar forward-looking information). All such assistance referred to in this
_Section 6.17_ shall be at Parents sole cost and expense and on the Closing
Date or termination of this Agreement, upon the written request of the
Company, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any such reasonable
documented and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in complying with, or providing

require the Company or any of its Affiliates to agree to any contractual
obligation relating to the Debt Financing (other than in respect of any
authorization letters) that is not expressly conditioned upon the consummation
of the Closing and that does not terminate without liability to the Company
upon the termination of this Agreement. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
agents from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or any assistance or activities
provided or any information or logos of the Company used in connection
therewith except to the extent (i) directly resulting from the gross
negligence and/or fraud of the Company and/or any of its directors, officers,
employees and agents or (ii) directly resulting from the Willful Breach of
this _Section 6.17_ by the Company and/or any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and agents. In addition, the Company agrees it shall file
current reports on Form 8-K (or otherwise disclose in a manner consistent with
Regulation FD) with respect to any material, non-public information with
respect to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
securities that Parent has agreed to include in any marketing materials
disseminated to "public side" lenders in connection with the Debt Financing
where the provision of such information to "public side" lenders has been
consented to by the Company.

if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Subject to the following sentence,
it is accordingly agreed that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, to cause Parent to
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter to cause the Financing to be
funded, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in the courts described in _Section 9.06_, without proof of damages or
otherwise, and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of
the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties agrees that it waives
the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and will not oppose the granting of
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that (x) the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 9.08_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 9.08(a)_, the right
of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the
Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Commitment Letter)
to fund the Merger Consideration and Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
cause the Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Closing (but not
the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the
requirements that (i) with respect to the consummation of the Offer (including
the payment of the Offer Price and drawing down the Financing related
thereto), all Offer Conditions were satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but
subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied) or validly waived in
accordance with the terms hereof at the Offer Expiration Time, (ii) with
respect to the consummation of the Merger (including the payment of the Merger
Consideration and drawing down the Financing related thereto) the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ were satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Effective Time, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied) or validly waived in accordance with
the terms hereof at the Effective Time and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific performance is granted and
the Financing is funded, the Closing will occur substantially simultaneously
with the drawdown of the Financing and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn,
modified or conditioned such confirmation and (B) the Company is prepared,
willing and able to effect the Closing and the Transactions, then it would
take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur.

 



 

Section 9.09. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as

 



      
 

 



 

possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits to
this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure
Schedules), the CVR Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Commitment Letter and any documents delivered by the parties in
connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto;
_provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance
with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

Section 9.11. _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed
the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto. Any
matter set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company under this
Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards
set forth in this Agreement, nor shall be construed as an admission or
indication to any Third Party that any breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

 



 

Section 9.12. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, it
being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF
form, or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures.

 ** _Annex A_**

 



 

 **Conditions of the Offer**

 



 

The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)" through "(h)" below.
Accordingly, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement to
the contrary, Merger Sub shall not be required to consummate the Offer, accept
for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Subs obligation to
pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal
of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or,
subject to such rules and regulations, the payment for, any tendered Shares
and, if permitted by the Merger Agreement, may terminate the Offer: (i) if the
Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE 8_; and (ii)
at any scheduled Offer Expiration Time (as the Offer may have been extended
pursuant to, and subject to any requirements to extend the Offer pursuant to,
_Section 2.01(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if: (A) the Minimum Tender
Condition or the Termination Condition shall not be satisfied by the Offer
Expiration Time; or (B) any of the additional conditions set forth below shall
not be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waived in
writing by Parent:

 



 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn that
number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in
Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a majority of the Shares
outstanding at the Offer Expiration Time assuming exercise of all Vested
Company Stock Options and exercise of all of the Oxford Warrants (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(b) any waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act applicable
to the Transactions shall have expired or been terminated (it being understood
that any consent shall be deemed obtained if the relevant merger control
authority (A) has declared that it does not have jurisdiction, or has
determined not to exercise its jurisdiction, to review the Transactions, (B)
has consented to, approved, or cleared the Transactions or (C) may no longer
prohibit the Transactions due to the expiry of all relevant time periods);

 



 

(c) no Order shall have been issued by any Governmental Authority and no
Applicable Law shall be in effect that would (A) make the Offer or the Merger
illegal or (B) otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation thereof;

 



 

(d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not have occurred a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(e) (1) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.01_, _Section 4.03_, _Section 4.10(b)_ and _Section 4.25_ shall
be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and
the date of the Offer Acceptance Time, as if made at such time, except to the
extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific
date (in which case on and as of such specific date), (2) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.06(a)_ shall be true
and correct in all respects (except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies) as of the
Offer Acceptance Time, as if made at such time, except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case
on and as of such specific date), and (3) each of the other representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement shall be true
and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Offer
Acceptance Time, as if made at such time, except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case
on and as of such specific date), other than in the case of this clause (3)
for such failures to be true and correct that

      
 

 



 

have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for
this purpose all references to the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and
other qualifications based on the word "material," set forth in any such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded);

 



 

(f) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
each of the covenants, obligations and agreements it is required to comply
with or perform at or prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(g) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received from the Company a certificate,
signed by each of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, dated the date on the which the Offer expires certifying that the
conditions specified in clauses (d), (e) and (f) have been satisfied; and

 



 

(h) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition
(which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the Company), may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in
each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Applicable Law. Any
reference in this _Annex A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this _Annex A_ is attached.
