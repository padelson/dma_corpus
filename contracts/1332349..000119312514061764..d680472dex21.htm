corporation (" _Parent_ "), Broadway Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and Emeritus Corporation, a Washington corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and Merger
Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub entering into
this Agreement, Parent and certain shareholders of the Company have entered
into a Voting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(the " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed
to vote all shares of Company Common Stock held by them in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Washington Business
Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ ") and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub
in accordance with the WBCA and the DGCL.

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the
parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036, unless another date or place
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER] Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington (the " _Washington
Secretary of State_ ") and a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Secretary of State_ "), each executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the WBCA and the DGCL, respectively, and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the WBCA and the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger
are duly filed with the Washington Secretary of State and the Delaware
Secretary of State, respectively, or at such other time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and shall specify in the Articles of Merger and the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ "). This Agreement together with _Exhibit A_ hereto but
excluding the other Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement shall be deemed
the "plan of merger" under Chapter 11 of the WBCA and shall be filed with the
Articles of Merger pursuant to Section 23B.11.050(1) of the WBCA.

 

Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the WBCA and the
DGCL.

Section 1.05 _Charter; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement,
and as so amended shall become the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by the
WBCA or other applicable Law (as defined herein).

ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS_

Section 2.01  _Effect on Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, by Parent or by any Subsidiary of
Parent, and each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company, shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(b)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ and Dissenting
Shares and except as provided in _Section 2.01(e)_ with respect to
fractional shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
0.95 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), of Parent, subject to adjustment
as provided in _Section 2.01(d)_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All shares
of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry
share registered in the transfer books of the Company (a " _Book-Entry Share_
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.02_ or Fractional Shares Cash Amount in
accordance with _Section 2.01(e)_.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. All common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and

[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

3 (d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
subject to  _Section 5.01_, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company should split,
combine or otherwise reclassify the Company Common Stock, or make a
distribution in Company Common Stock, or otherwise change the Company Common
Stock into any other securities, then (without limiting any other rights of
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted
to reflect any such change. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to _Section 5.01_, if at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent should
split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Stock, or make
a distribution in Parent Common Stock, or otherwise change the Parent Common
Stock into other securities, then the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted
to reflect any such change.

 

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book Entry Shares by virtue of the Merger or pursuant to
this Agreement (it being understood that such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Parent), and in lieu thereof each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder of record) shall be
entitled to receive in lieu thereof, upon surrender of such holders shares of
Company Common Stock in the manner set forth in _Section 2.02_, an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the Applicable Closing Price (the "
_Fractional Shares Cash Amount_ ").

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange Fund; Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to Parents
stockholders and the Companys shareholders, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(b)_. Immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent (i) such number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
pay the Merger Consideration and (ii) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Fractional Shares Cash Amount (such shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash as deposited with the Exchange Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in
each case, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.01_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds), as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange
Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional
Shares Cash Amount out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement
and the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

4  shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, persons
who held shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or other shares of Company Common Stock presented to the Exchange
Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection
by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate (x) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify, (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and (z)
the method of payment of such holders Fractional Shares Cash Amount, if
applicable.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , to be mailed or made
available for collection by hand, within two (2) business days following the
later to occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agents receipt
of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and if applicable,
the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration and if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash Amount
as contemplated by this _Article II_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates. 

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

5 (iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue to each holder of Book-Entry Shares
that number of uncertificated whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ in respect of
such Book-Entry Shares and pay to such holder the Fractional Shares Cash
Amount, as applicable, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent
(provided that the holder of the Book-Entry Shares otherwise complies with the
Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities in book-entry
form), and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall
be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Book-Entry Shares.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.02(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred, and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer taxes and other taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration or Fractional
Shares Cash Amount to which they are entitled under this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims
with respect thereto (without any interest thereon).

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent
or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.

6 Section 2.03 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock; ESPP_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) _Treatment of In-the-Money Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of any holder or the Company, each In-the-
Money Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right
of the holder to receive a number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (A) the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-
Money Company Stock Option immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the
excess of the Applicable Closing Price over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of such In-the-Money Company Stock Option, divided by (B)
the VWAP of Parent Common Stock, less (C) that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) with a fair
market value (as determined by using the VWAP of Parent Common Stock) equal to
the minimum amount of any required withholding taxes. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _In-the-Money Company Stock Option_ " means each stock option
granted under the Company Stock Plans (whether vested or unvested) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock that is less than the Applicable Closing Price.
If any adjustments are made to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to _Section
2.01(d)_, the parties shall determine in good faith adjustments to the
Applicable Closing Price to reflect any such changes;  _provided_ , that any
such adjustments made to the Applicable Closing Price between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time shall be made in a manner intended to comply
with Section 409A of the Code. Parent will issue (or cause to be issued) a
holders shares of Parent Common Stock determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(a)(i)_ to such holder immediately following the Effective Time.

 

(ii) _Treatment of Other Company Stock Options_. All stock options granted
under the Company Stock Plans (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) and that are not In-the-Money Company Stock Options will terminate
and cease to be outstanding at the Effective Time without any further action
by the holder thereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans
or any agreement evidencing such Company Stock Options, as applicable, without
the payment of any consideration in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder or the Company,
each share of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
that is then outstanding and unvested (the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ")
shall become fully vested and no longer subject to forfeiture and will
be treated as a share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of _Section 2.01(b)_. At
the Effective Time, there shall be no shares of Company Restricted Stock
outstanding. Each holder

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

7  of Company Restricted Stock shall be permitted to surrender shares of Parent
Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b)_ in satisfaction of any required withholding taxes.

(c) _Treatment of ESPP_. With respect to the Companys 2009 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ "), (i) participation shall be limited to
those employees who are participants in the Company ESPP on the date of this
Agreement; (ii) no new Purchase Period (as defined in the Company ESPP), other
than the Purchase Period in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall be
authorized, continued or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement;
(iii) participants in the Company ESPP may not increase their payroll
deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement; (iv) if the Closing Date occurs prior to the end of the Purchase
Period in effect on the date of this Agreement, then the Purchase Date (as
defined in the Company ESPP) with respect to such Purchase Period shall be
the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date and each then-
outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase
from the Company shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price
determined under the terms of the Company ESPP (subject to such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect any shortening of the Purchase
Period but otherwise treating such Purchase Period as a fully effective and
completed Purchase Period for all purposes under the Company ESPP) and such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration and, with respect to any resulting fractional shares, the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount; and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate,
effective upon the Closing Date.

(d) _Required Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i)
take all actions necessary or desirable to provide for and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.03_, including, (x) providing
notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option and each holder of a share of
Company Restricted Stock, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the
treatment of such Company Stock Option or share of Company Restricted Stock as
provided in this _Section 2.03_, and (y) satisfying all applicable
requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) if
requested by Parent, take all actions necessary to terminate the Companys
Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the Companys 2006 Amended
and Restated Equity Incentive Plan and/or the Companys Amended and Restated
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (each, a " _Company Stock Plan_ "
and together, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") effective as of the Effective
Time. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable
opportunity to comment upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may
be required or desirable to give effect to the provisions of this  _Section
2.03_.

Section 2.04 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a
Certificate, Book-Entry Share, Company Stock Option or Company Restricted
Stock or any participant in the Company ESPP, such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code or any provisions of applicable state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this 

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

8  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry
Share, Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock or participant in the
Company ESPP, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent.

Section 2.05 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.06 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder
who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised such shareholders appraisal rights in
compliance with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such shareholder
shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such shareholders right to appraisal under the WBCA. By virtue of the Merger,
all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and the
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall thereafter be entitled only to such
rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares as are provided under Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, all Dissenting Shares held by a shareholder who shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal
shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right
to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder without any interest thereon,
in the case of Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner set
forth in this _Article II_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
notices or demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in the
WBCA, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any notices or demands for appraisals, offer to settle
or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such notices or
demands.

1, 2013 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Filed Company SEC Documents_ "), but excluding, in each case, any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to
the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature; _provided_ , that the exception provided for in

subject matter of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of the
text of such disclosure to be applicable to the representation set forth
herein, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (except to the extent the "good standing" concept is not
applicable in any relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is formed and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in,
and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined herein). The Company has, prior to the date hereof, made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Restated Articles of
Incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and Amended and Restated Bylaws
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and the charter and bylaws (or comparable

as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of the minutes of all meetings of
shareholders of the Company, the board of directors of the Company (the "
_Company Board_ ") and each committee of the Company Board and the board of
directors of each of its material Subsidiaries held since December 31, 2010,
except for such portions of the minutes of the Company Board or any committee
of the Company Board with respect to the consideration by such directors of
the possible acquisition of the Company.

Section 3.02 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists all the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the
state of formation and each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is qualified
or licensed to do business. Except for Permitted Liens and as set forth
on Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter, all the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned
directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free of any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
equity interests. Except

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

10  for the capital stock or other equity or voting interests of its
Subsidiaries and those equity interests described on Section 3.02 of the

and outstanding (none of which were owned by the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise)), (ii) 5,160,032 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved

outstanding.

(b) The Company has delivered to Parent a correct and complete list, as of
the close of business on February 18, 2014, of all outstanding Company Stock

receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans
or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto
(assuming target performance, if applicable), the vesting schedule, expiration
dates and exercise prices thereof, in each case broken down as to each plan,
agreement or other arrangement and as to each individual holder. The Company
will no later than two (2) business days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, provide an updated list to Parent to reflect any changes thereto, which
such list shall be correct and complete as of three (3) business days prior

and/or programs designed to ensure that its agents and employees are in
material compliance with all applicable Laws, including Laws, directives and

operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or its accountants, except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not

provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, including adopting policies and procedures that: (1)
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company and

[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

20  maintained in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; and (4) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent
copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared, and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the
Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable security and privacy standards regarding protected health
information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 and all applicable state privacy Laws, and with all applicable

applied by Parent on a consistent basis during the periods and at the dates

in all material respects the financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to the absence of footnote disclosure and to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments not material in amount).

individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be

Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has been since December 31, 2010 and is
in compliance with all Laws applicable to it, its properties or other assets
or its business or operations, except for such violations or noncompliance
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent and its
Subsidiaries have in effect all material permits, licenses, registrations,
variances, exemptions, authorizations, operating certificates, franchises,
orders, approvals, and similar rights issued by or obtained from all
Governmental Authorities (collectively, " _Parent Permits_ ") necessary to
carry on their businesses as now conducted, and there has occurred no
violation of, default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
under, or event giving to others any right of termination, amendment or
cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any Parent
Permit, except for such violation, default, terminations, amendments or
cancellations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
There is no event which has occurred that, to the Knowledge of Parent,
would reasonably be expected to result in the termination, revocation,
cancellation, nonrenewal or adverse modification of any such Parent Permit
that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Assuming all notices or consents contemplated
by _Section 4.05_ are made or obtained, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any properties or other assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any such Parent Permit.

 

(b) Since December 31, 2010, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any third party service provider acting on
behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received, nor otherwise has
any Knowledge of, any written notice from any Governmental Authority that (x)
alleges or relates to any material violation or noncompliance (or that Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any such third party service provider is under
investigation or the subject of an inquiry by any such Governmental Authority
for such alleged material noncompliance) with any applicable material Law
or (y) would be reasonably likely to result in a material fine, assessment or
cease and desist order, or the suspension, revocation or material limitation
or restriction of any Parent Permit; and (ii) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement or settlement with any
Governmental Authority with respect to its material noncompliance with, or
violation of, any applicable Law.

 

(c) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all material
regulatory reports, schedules, statements, documents, filings, submissions,
forms, registrations and other documents, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that each was required to file with
any Governmental Authority, including state health and regulatory authorities
and any applicable Federal regulatory authorities, and have timely paid all
taxes, fees

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

46  and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to make such filings or payments would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have implemented policies, procedures
and/or programs designed to ensure that its agents and employees are in
material compliance with all applicable Laws, including Laws, directives and
opinions of Governmental Authorities relating to advertising, licensing and
sales practices.

 

(e) Parent and each of its officers and directors are in compliance with, and
have complied in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley or the Exchange Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

(f) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent or its accountants, except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on Parents system of internal
accounting controls. Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including adopting policies and procedures that: (1) provide reasonable
assurance that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of Parent; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP; (3) provide reasonable assurance that
the records of Parent and its Subsidiaries are maintained in
reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (4) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parents and its Subsidiaries assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed to the Parents auditors and the audit committee of
the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls. Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act that are designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including
its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

47  Parents periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

(g) Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with
all applicable security and privacy standards regarding protected health

(iii) has been excluded or suspended from participation in any
federal healthcare programs, as such term is defined in 42 U.S.C. §
1320a-7b(f); or (iv) has been debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,
declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded by any Governmental Authority
implementing a federal healthcare program.

participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program, or other Government
Programs, has a current and valid provider contract and provider number(s)
with such program, and is in material compliance with the conditions of

any of its Subsidiaries may have direct or indirect liability (collectively,
the " _Parent Plans_ ") have been maintained in all material respects in

[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

48  or "disqualified person" with respect to the Parent Plans has engaged in a
non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA that would cause Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any liability for any material amount. Neither Parent
(or any of its Subsidiaries) nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
fiduciary of any Parent Plan has any material liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply with applicable Law in
connection with the administration or investment of assets of any Parent Plan.

 

(b) Each of the Parent Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter as to its
qualified status under the Code or is a prototype or volume submitter plan
entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the favorable opinion or
advisory letter issued to the sponsor of such prototype or volume
submitter plan. Nothing has occurred since the date of any such letter that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Parent Plan or the tax-exemption of any trust related thereto.

 

(c) None of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that is treated as a single employer, with any of them under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a " _Parent ERISA Affiliate_ ")
(or was so treated at any time during the six years immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement) has (or, in the case of any former Parent ERISA
Affiliate during the last six years, had at the time it was a Parent ERISA
Affiliate) any current or contingent liability with respect to (i) a plan
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or
(ii) any Multiemployer Plan.

(d) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of the
Parent Plans (including workers compensation) or by Law (without regard to any
waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code), to any funds or trusts
established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due
date thereof (including any valid extension), except where failure to do so
has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits that have been asserted
or instituted against the Parent Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under
the Parent Plans or the sponsor or administrator of any of the Parent Plans,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, against any fiduciary of the Parent Plans with
respect to the operation of any of the Parent Plans (other than routine
benefit claims), nor does Parent have any Knowledge of facts that could form a
reasonable basis for any such action, claim or lawsuit, other than such
actions, claims or lawsuits that individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(f) Except as set forth on Section 4.12(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
none of the Parent Plans provides for post-employment life or health

disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of employment, and (v) the
right to convert from group coverage to an individual policy that will be
maintained at the sole expense of the participant or the participants
beneficiary. Each of Parent and any Parent ERISA Affiliate which maintains a
"group health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has
complied with the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder,
except where the failure to comply individually or in the aggregate has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either by themselves or when combined
with any other event), will (i) result in any payment becoming due to any
Parent Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Parent Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits under any Parent Plan or (iv) result in any
obligation to any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation or
benefits under a Parent Plan. Since January 1, 2013, Parent, including, for
purposes of this sentence, the Parent Board, any committee thereof, any
committee administering a Parent Plan and any officer of Parent, has not
taken any action to increase the compensation or benefits payable after the
date hereof to any Parent Employee, which increase may be directly or
indirectly, partially or wholly, related to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either by themselves or when combined with any other event).

 

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has a contract, plan or
commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Parent
Plan or to modify any existing Parent Plan, except as required by applicable
Law or tax qualification requirement or as necessary to conform a Parent Plan
to applicable Law.

 

(i) Each Parent Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a

Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees
or any investment

representative retained by the Subject Company or any Subsidiary in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, in its or
their capacity as such) (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly
encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any person any information in connection
with or in furtherance of any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Subject Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section 5.02(a)_ by the Subject
Company. The Subject Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Takeover Proposal and, except as provided in Section
5.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this _Section 5.02(a)_, at any time
prior to obtaining the Subject Company Shareholder Approval (and in no event
after obtaining such Subject Company Shareholder Approval), in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
that the Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its
outside counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, the Subject Company may, if the Subject Company Board determines in
good faith (after receiving advice of its outside counsel) that it is
necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Subject Company under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with _Section 5.02(c)_, and after giving the Other Party two (2)
business days written notice of such determination, (A) furnish information
with respect to the Subject Company and its Subsidiaries to the person (and
its Representatives) making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement (the parties agreeing that the confidentiality
agreement may exclude a standstill), _provided_ , that all such oral or
written information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided to the Other Party) is provided or made available to the
Other Party, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrent with the
time it is provided or made available to such person, as the case may be, and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent
from considering, participating in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnishing to any person any of Parents information in connection with or
in furtherance of, or entering into any agreement providing for or in
connection with, any inquiry, proposal or offer that would otherwise
constitute a Takeover Proposal, so long as (i) such inquiry, proposal or offer
contemplates a transaction that would not require or be subject an Adverse
Recommendation Change by Parent or a termination of this Agreement and (ii)
with respect to the entry into any such agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such agreement, such entry or consummation would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair Parents or
Merger Subs ability to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Termination Date (" _Permitted
Transaction_ "); provided however that the closing of the transactions
contemplated by such agreement shall in no event occur prior to the Closing;
provided further that for purposes of the definition of

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

68  "Permitted Transaction," references in the term "Takeover Proposal" to "20%"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%". For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 5.02(a)_ shall relieve any party from its
obligations under _Section 6.03_ of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean, with
respect to the Subject Company, any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination involving the
Subject Company, (b) for the issuance of 20% or more of the equity securities
of the Subject Company as consideration for the assets or securities of
another person or (c) to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20%
or more of the equity securities of the Subject Company or assets (including
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Subject Company) that represent 20%
or more of the total consolidated assets of the Subject Company, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Permitted Transaction.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Other Party_ " shall mean (a) Parent and
Merger Sub, when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for the Company,
and (b) the Company, when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for
Parent or any Permitted Transaction.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company_ " shall mean (a) the
Company, when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for, or Intervening
Event of, the Company, and (b) Parent, when used with respect to any Takeover
Proposal for, or Intervening Event of, Parent or any Permitted Transaction.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company Board_ " shall mean (a) the
Company Board, when the context refers to the Company as the Subject Company,
and (b) the Parent Board, when the context refers to Parent as the Subject
Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company Shareholder Approval_ "
shall mean the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder
Approval, as the case may be.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written offer made by a third party, that if consummated would result in
such person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 50% or more
of the shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may
be, then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all of the total consolidated assets of the Subject Company (i) on terms which
the Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its outside
counsel and in light of all relevant circumstances, including, without
limitation, all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement)
to be more favorable to the shareholders of the Subject Company from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) which is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any
financing and approval requirements and all other financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing,
if a cash transaction (in whole or part), is then fully committed or
reasonably determined to be available by the Subject Company Board.

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

69 (b) Neither the Subject Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Other Party), or propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Other Party), the Company
Recommendation, where the Company is the Subject Company, or the Parent
Recommendation, where Parent is the Subject Company, (it being understood
that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, other than a "stop, look and listen" statement in compliance with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall be considered an adverse
modification) or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")
or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the
Subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to 
_Section 5.02(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subject Company Board
may, prior to obtaining the Subject Company Shareholder Approval (and in no
event after obtaining such applicable Subject Company Shareholder Approval),
if the Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice
of its outside counsel) that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Subject Company under
applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of a
Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement solely in order to concurrently
enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or (y) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change solely in response to an Intervening Event,
but, in each case, only at a time that is after the fifth business day
following the Other Partys receipt of written notice from the Subject Company
(an " _Adverse Notice_ ") advising the Other Party that the Subject Company
Board has determined, in the case of the preceding clause (x), that a Takeover
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, that the Subject Company Board intends to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement and
containing all information required by _Section 5.02(c)_, together with
copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of such Superior Proposal,
(it being agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Notice and a new
three business day period), and, in the case of the preceding clause (y), that
the Subject Company Board intends to make such Adverse Recommendation Change,
a description of the Intervening Event and the reasons for the Adverse
Recommendation Change (it being agreed that changes in circumstances shall
require a new Adverse Notice and a new three business day period). In
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate
this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, the Subject Company Board
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement in a bona
fide written proposal by the Other Party (in response to an Adverse Notice or
otherwise) in determining whether such third party Takeover Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal. In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, the Subject
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement in a bona fide written proposal by the Other Party (in response to
an Adverse Notice or otherwise) in determining whether an Adverse
Recommendation Change ceases to be necessary in order to comply with the
Subject Company Boards fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Subject
Company under applicable Law. In all cases, during the five (or three)
business day period following delivery of an Adverse Notice, the Subject
Company and its Representatives shall, if

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

70  requested by the Other Party, negotiate in good faith with the Other Party
and the Other Partys Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms of
this Agreement as would enable the Other Party to proceed with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby on such adjusted terms without
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, as
applicable.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material
event, circumstance, change or effect that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or
magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable)
to the Subject Company Board on the date of this Agreement, which
event, circumstance, change or effect (including any change in probability or
magnitude of consequences) becomes known to the Subject Company Board before
the Subject Company Shareholder Approval is obtained; _provided_ , that in no
event shall (i) any action taken by either party pursuant to and in
compliance with the affirmative covenants set forth in _Section 6.03_, and
the consequences of any such action, constitute an Intervening Event, (ii) the
receipt, existence of or terms of a Takeover Proposal for the Subject Company
or any inquiry relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an
Intervening Event of the Subject Company and (iii) any decline in the market
price or trading volume of the securities of the Other Party constitute an
Intervening Event of the Subject Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Parents
entry into a definitive agreement providing for a Permitted Transaction may
constitute an "Intervening Event" as to the Company or Parent.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Subject Company set forth in
paragraphs _(a)_ and  _(b)_ of this _Section 5.02_, the Subject Company
shall promptly advise the Other Party orally and in writing of any request for
information or other inquiry that the Subject Company reasonably believes
could lead to any Takeover Proposal or Permitted Transaction, the financial
and other material terms and conditions of any such request, Takeover
Proposal, Permitted Transaction or inquiry (including any changes thereto),
the identity of the person making any such request, Takeover Proposal,
Permitted Transaction or inquiry, and copies of any written offer, proposal or
other documentation in respect of such request, Takeover Proposal, Permitted
Transaction or inquiry. The Subject Company shall promptly keep the
Other Party reasonably informed of the status and material details (including
any change to the financial and other material terms thereof) of any such
request, Takeover Proposal, Permitted Transaction or inquiry.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Subject
Company or the Subject Company Board from (i) complying with the Subject
Companys obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the shareholders of
the Subject Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Subject Company
Board (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would
constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such disclosure relating to a Takeover Proposal or Intervening Event
(other than a "stop, look and listen" statement in compliance with Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Subject Company Board reaffirms its recommendation and declaration
of advisability of this Agreement and the Merger.

(e) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.02_, the Company will not approve
a Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal for purposes of Chapter 23B.19 of
the WBCA.

Joint Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary

they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC

shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval.

to the other party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such
period, each party shall furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by such
party during such period and not publicly available pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and (b) consistent with its
legal obligations all other information concerning the party and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party or any of
its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any Law or
treaty of any Governmental Authority applicable to it, or any Contract to
which it is a party, or in order to maintain attorney-client privilege
requires it to restrict access to any properties or information ( _provided_
that in any such case, the parties shall cooperate to seek to provide for
access in a manner that does not violate any such Law, treaty or Contract or

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

73  attorney-client privilege). Except for disclosures expressly permitted by
the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated as of February 15, 2013,
between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party shall hold, and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, all information received from the other party,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with and otherwise
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_ or information provided, made available or delivered pursuant
to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
Company or Parent contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to
the obligations of the parties hereto.

 

Section 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (a) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the
taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,
or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (c) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
and (d) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement (but in the case of the consents and
approvals contemplated by _Sections 7.02(e)_ and _7.02(f)_ and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, subject in all cases to
the conditions described in _Section 7.02(e)_ (it being understood and agreed
that Parent shall not be required to pay any amounts in excess of the Cost
Maximum for the purposes of obtaining such consents and approvals)). In
connection with and without limiting the first sentence of this _Section
6.03(a)_, each of the Company and the Company Board and Parent and the Parent
Board shall (i) take no action to cause any state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make or cause to be made, as promptly as practicable, and no
later than twenty (20) days after the date hereof, an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

74  connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority and to any requests for additional information at the
earliest practicable date, including promptly informing the other party of
such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or
submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party
and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. Such
information can be shared on an outside counsel basis or subject to other
restrictions to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by counsel for the
disclosing party. To the extent practicable, and permitted by a Governmental
Authority, each party hereto shall permit Representatives of the other party
to participate in meetings (whether by telephone or in person) with such
Governmental Authority. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of any judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the
Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the case of the consents and approvals contemplated by _Section
7.01(b)_, Parent will not be required to (and the Company shall not without

the case of (A), (B), (C) and (D) in the aggregate as would not, or as would
not reasonably be expected to, (i) be materially adverse to Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) taken as a whole,
following the Effective Time; (ii) materially and adversely diminish the
benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) without duplication, result in the
incurrence (on a net basis) of any cost (including any breakage cost),
expense, fee, judgment, settlement, penalty (including any prepayment
penalty), or diminution in value or lost profit (but not revenue) (calculated
for any such diminution in value or lost profit on a net present
value basis), loss (including any loss on the sale of any asset relative to
the fair market value thereof), concession (including any payments made to or
received by a third party or that results from any entry into, or amendment or
modification to, any Contract), or other liability in the aggregate in excess
of $37,500,000 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting
the proviso at the end of this Section 6.03(c), as a result of a breach of, or
default or cross-default under, any Contract); provided, however, that
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries be
required to take any action that would, directly or indirectly, result in or
reasonably be expected to result in any breach of, or default or cross-default
under, any Contract (including any lease or management contract), with the
understanding and agreement that, subject in all cases to the express
limitations set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, Parent
and the Company shall take, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to take, all

Governmental Authority or any third party (such as lessors, landlords,
lenders,

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

75  management companies and other counterparties), making reasonable requests,
negotiating to reach acceptable resolutions, requesting waivers, engaging
third party managers, substituting collateral, substituting leased assets,
entering into a sublease or other assignment arrangement, and other
commercially reasonable actions; or (iv) involve the divestiture of assets
valued in the aggregate at a gross fair market value as determined in good
faith by Parent in excess of $200,000,000.

Section 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors and officers of the Company and its

Charter or the Company Bylaws (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof)

continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for six years
after the Effective Time.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
covering the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which

prior year premium amount, Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount.

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.04_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties

whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

shareholder litigation. Each party shall give the other parties the
opportunity to consult with the party regarding the defense or settlement of
any such shareholder litigation, shall give due consideration to the other
partys advice with respect to such shareholder litigation and shall not
settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company further will not, without Parents
prior written consent, settle any shareholder litigation unless (a) the
resolution of all such litigation requires direct or indirect payment from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in an amount not to exceed the amount set
forth in _Section 6.07_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; (b) the settlement
does not involve or have the effect of imposing any remedy or restriction upon

Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; (c) the settlement provides
that Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives are
released from all liability in connection therewith; and (d) none of Parent,

its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remain
employed thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
Parents Subsidiaries (the " _Affected Employees_ "), compensation and

Corporation to, recognize (or with respect to any insured arrangement, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize) the service of the Affected
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to
the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding
Company Plan for those purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
recognition shall not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

77 (c) With respect to any welfare plan in which employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,

requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions were
satisfied (or not applicable) under the welfare plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each such employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time and in the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs in satisfying
any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements.

plans sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii) the Companys Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Plan, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. All
resolutions, notices or other documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with such terminations shall be subject to Parents reasonable
prior review and comment. Each Affected Employee participating in (or eligible
to participate in) a Company 401(k) Plan at the time such plan is terminated
shall become eligible to participate at the Effective Time in a 401(k) plan
sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause such Parent
or Parent Subsidiary 401(k) plan to accept a direct rollover of any eligible
rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of ERISA), including
any portion thereof that constitutes a loan to the participant, made on behalf
of an Affected Employee from a Company 401(k) Plan.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.08_ shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section
6.08_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this _Section 6.08_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Affected Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any
other person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any employee
or beneficiary of such employee or other person under a Company Plan that
such employee or beneficiary or other person would not otherwise have under

Section 6.09 _Cooperation_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and
will cause each of its Representatives to, use its reasonable efforts,
subject to applicable Laws, to cooperate with and assist Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with planning the integration of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective employees with the business operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.10 _Financing; Secondary Sale_. The Company shall, if reasonably
requested by Parent (a) in connection with Parents efforts to obtain any
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(" _Financing_ "), cooperate in good faith with Parent, form or cause its
Subsidiaries to form, on or prior to the Closing, new wholly owned
Subsidiaries, and, at the Closing execute any documents, agreements and
instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing, all in such order, form and
substance as reasonably requested by Parent and (b) as promptly as
practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in complying
with its obligations under

Parent and the stockholders party thereto, to register and sell "Registrable
Securities" under that agreement; _provided_ that, in each case, such
cooperation shall not prevent or materially impede or delay consummation of
the Merger, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business operations of
the Company, require the expenditure of any material amount of money by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent not reimbursed by Parent),
violate any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or violate any Company Permit or Law or subject the Company to any
liability, encumbrance or obligation (not reimbursed or otherwise indemnified
by Parent) if the Merger is not consummated.

 

Section 6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by
executing and delivering the officers certificates referred to herein.
Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any action, or fail to take
any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 6.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause (a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (b) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become
or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.14 _Board Representation_. The parties shall take all actions
necessary to provide that at the Closing, the Parent Board shall have
appointed one (1) individual serving on the Company Board immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable
to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the " _Committee_ ") of
the Parent Board (the " _Company Designee_ ") to serve on the Parent Board in
such class as Parent may determine in its sole discretion, provided that the
term of such class does not expire prior to the third anniversary of the date
hereof, initially, until the expiration of such Company Designees class term.
The Company and Parent agree that in the event that the Company Designee is
unable to serve, for any reason, as a director of Parent at the Effective
Time, the Company shall have the right to designate another individual serving
on the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to serve as
a director of Parent, and to become the Company Designee, in place of
the Company Designee originally designated (the " _Substitute Designee_ ");
_provided_ that such Substitute Designee shall likewise be reasonably
acceptable to the Committee.

satisfied, in each case, unless (1) the sum of (x) any actual out-of-pocket
losses (other than filing costs and legal or other consulting or professional
advisor fees) to Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
reasonably expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result from one or
more failures existing with respect to such condition in clause (i), plus (y)
any Lender Costs with respect to the condition in clause (ii), exceeds the

its counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, dated as of the
Closing Date and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set
forth in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the

require and rely upon customary representations contained in certificates of
officers of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to it.

Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard to materiality or
Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein), except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date, except where the failure of the

Material Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties of Parent set
forth in _Section 4.03_ shall be true and correct in all material respects as

of its counsel, Perkins Coie LLP, dated as of the Closing Date and in form

or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Sections

was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as required by and subject to _Section 6.03_.

made an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) within ten (10) business days
of the date any Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been

Proposal, (2) in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause
_(ii)_ of this _Section 8.02(a)_, on the date of such termination, or (3)

termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ by the Company shall
be deemed to be a termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.01(c)_ or
_Section 8.01(e)_ if Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement

or communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of the Company generally and (B) within twelve (12) months after

of Parent generally and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination
Parent shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have

clause (B) all references in the definition of Takeover Proposal to 20% shall
instead refer to 50%; or

of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Takeover Proposal, (2)
in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause _(ii)_ of this

Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause _(iv)_ of this _Section 8.02(b)_

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any termination of this Agreement
under _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ by Parent shall be deemed to be a termination of
this Agreement under _Section 8.01(d)_ or _Section 8.01(g)_ if the Company
would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8.01(d)_
or _Section 8.01(g)_ (or would have been entitled to terminate this
Agreement but for the Companys inability to terminate this Agreement as a
result of any applicable waiting or notice period as prescribed in such
provisions), respectively, at the time of such termination by Parent. In case
of the termination of this Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to

payment of such fee) shall not limit in any respect any rights or remedies
available to the Company relating to any willful breach or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement resulting, directly or indirectly, in the right to receive the
Termination Fee. In the event that either party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iv)_ and (A) after

 



[AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER]

87  the date of this Agreement but before the Parent Shareholder Meeting a
Takeover Proposal with respect to Parent shall have been made or communicated
to Parent or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Parent
generally and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination Parent
shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have
consummated a Takeover Proposal, then Parent shall, upon the earlier of the
date of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Takeover
Proposal, pay the Company the Termination Fee, less any portion of the Parent
Shareholder Termination Payment previously paid by Parent to the Company
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_, by wire transfer of same-day funds;
_provided_ that for purposes of clause (B) of this sentence, all references in

in no event shall be obligated to pay more than one such Termination Fee with
respect to all such agreements and occurrences and such termination.

_Section 8.02(a)_ and _Section 8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If a party fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_, in the case of
the Company, or _Section 8.02(b)_, or in the case of Parent, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, the non-
paying party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in  _Section 8.01_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
other than the provisions of the penultimate sentence of  _Section 6.02_,
_Sections 6.05_ and _8.02_ , this _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which
provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from any liability for any material breach hereof.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or
the Parent Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such
approvals have been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the shareholders of the applicable party without
such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.
