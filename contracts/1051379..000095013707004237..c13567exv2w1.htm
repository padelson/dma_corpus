<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Gentlemen:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of
Northwest Suburban Bancorp., Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Seller&#148;), as the term &#147;affiliate&#148;
is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and Regulations (the
&#147;Rules and Regulations&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Act&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of March&nbsp;22, 2007 (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), among Midwest Banc Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and the Seller, the Seller will be merged with and into the Company
(the &#147;Merger&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the &#147;Company Securities&#148;). I would receive such shares in exchange for shares owned by
me of the Seller&#146;s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the &#147;Seller Securities&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant and covenant to the Company that in the event I receive any Company
Securities as a result of the Merger:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Company Securities in
violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed its requirements and
other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company
Securities, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Seller.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Company Securities to me pursuant to the Merger
has been registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4.
However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of
the stockholders of the Seller, I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Seller and the
distribution by me of the Company Securities has not been registered under the Act, and that I may
not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company Securities issued to me in the Merger unless (i)
such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of the Company Securities by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any
other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the Company&#146;s transfer
agents with respect to the Company Securities and that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Company Securities issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:
