As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Seller shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the  _"Surviving Corporation"_ ). 

  

 _Section 2.02._ _Closing, Effective Date and Effective Time_. At the Companys election, the closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ ) shall take place on (i) the last business day of, or (ii) the first business day of the month following, or (iii) the first business day of the month which is the first month of the earliest calendar quarter following, in each case, the month during which all applicable waiting periods in connection with approvals of Governmental Authorities and the receipt of all approvals of Governmental Authorities and all conditions to the consummation of the Merger (the _"Closing Conditions"_ ) are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) ( _provided,_ that no Closing Date determined under clause (iii) may occur more than forty-five (45) days after the date on which the 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Conditions are satisfied or waived), or on such other date after such
satisfaction or waiver as the Company and the Seller may agree (the 
_"Closing Date"_ ). Contemporaneous with the Closing, the Parties shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger, as necessary,
and any other required documents, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the effective date and time of such filing
or such date and time as the Company and the Seller shall agree and specify
in the certificate of merger are referred to herein as the _"Effective Time"_
; the date on which the Effective Time shall occur is referred to herein as
the _"Effective Date"_ ). 

  

 _Section 2.03._ _Effects of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Seller shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Seller shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 2.04._ _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended or restated (the _"Company Certificate"_ ), and the Companys By-Laws, as amended or restated (the _"Company By-Laws"_ ), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 2.05._ _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By Laws of the Surviving Corporation, except that one person, mutually satisfactory to the Company and the Seller who satisfies the definition of an "independent director" under the Nasdaq listing standards, shall be added to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable after the Effective Time.

With the prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Company may at any time prior to the Seller Stockholders Meeting change the method of effecting the combination with the Seller (including the provisions of this Article II) if and to the extent it deems such change to be reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable, _provided, however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration to be issued to holders of Seller Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) cause the transaction to not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents to reflect any such revised structure or method. 

  

ARTICLE III 

  

MERGER CONSIDERATION, EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

    

 _Section 3.01._ _Effect on Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Seller Common Stock: 

  

 (a) Seller Treasury Shares. All shares of Seller Common Stock that are owned by the Seller, other than in a fiduciary capacity, as treasury stock or otherwise (the _"Seller Treasury Shares"_ ) or by the Company shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no cash, Company Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Merger Consideration. Subject to Section 3.03, each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Seller Treasury Shares, the Dissenting Shares and shares of Seller Common Stock owned by the Company) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the following (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ): 

   

 (i) for each such share of Seller Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 3.02 (the _"Electing Seller Shares"_ ), the right to receive (A) the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio or (B) in the event that a Company Change of Control is consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing for a Company Change of Control, in each case prior to the Effective Time, 2.2095 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the shares of Company Common Stock set forth in clause (A) or clause (B), as applicable, are referred to herein as the _"Stock Consideration"_ ); and 

  

 (ii) for each such share of Seller Common Stock (other than Electing Seller Shares), the right to receive $42.75 in cash (the _"Cash Consideration"_ ). 

 

The Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be subject to further
adjustment as set forth in Section 3.04. Upon such conversion, all such
shares of Seller Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and cash for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.09
upon the surrender of the Certificate(s) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. 

   

 (c) Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged following the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Seller Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the _"Dissenting Shares"_ ) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall have failed to perfect any available right of appraisal under applicable Law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, the shares of Seller Common Stock held by such stockholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 3.01(b) (and, if no election is timely made by such holder pursuant to Section 3.02, into the Cash Consideration, subject to proration pursuant to Section 3.03). The Seller shall give the Company (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Seller, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Seller, and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Seller shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, (x) make any payment with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any such demand, or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. 

    ##### 

  

     

 _Section 3.02._ _Stock Elections_. 

  

 (a) Right to Make. Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Date, is a record holder of shares of Seller Common Stock shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such Persons shares, other than Seller Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares, to make an unconditional election (a _"Stock Election"_ ) on or prior to such Election Date to receive Company Common Stock for such holders shares of Seller Common Stock, on the basis hereinafter set forth; _provided, however,_  that, unless the nominee advises the Exchange Agent otherwise in writing, each of the beneficial owners of shares held of record by a bank, trust company, broker, dealer or other recognized nominee (including, for these purposes, shares allocated to participants accounts under any Seller Benefit Plans) shall be treated as a separate record holder and either directly or through such nominee may submit a separate Form of Election for shares that are beneficially owned by such beneficial owner. 

   

 (b) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall appoint, subject to the approval of the Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), an exchange agent (the _"Exchange Agent"_ ) for the purpose of exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Seller Common Stock (the _"Certificates"_ ) for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) Forms of Election. The Company shall prepare a form of election (the _"Form of Election"_ ) which shall be subject to the approval of the Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to be mailed by the Seller to the record holders of shares of Seller Common Stock not more than sixty (60) Business Days nor less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Election Date. The Form of Election may be included on the proxy solicited from stockholders of the Seller in connection with the approval of the Sellers stockholders of the Merger. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Seller Common Stock who wishes to make a Stock Election, subject to the proration provisions of Section 3.03. The Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons who become holders of shares of Seller Common Stock during the period between the record date for the mailing of the Form of Election and the Election Date. Any Stock Election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the Business Day specified by the Seller in the Form of Election (or a later Business Day specified by the Seller, reasonably acceptable to the Company, in a subsequent press release or other mailing to each of the Sellers stockholders) (the _"Election Date"_ ), which Election Date shall be two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the Company reasonably believes the Effective Time will occur, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Seller Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Seller (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm which is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery). Any Form of Election may be revoked by the stockholder submitting it only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the Election Date. If a Form of Election is revoked, the Certificate or Certificates (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate) for the shares of Seller Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates shall be promptly returned by the Exchange Agent to the stockholder of the Seller submitting the same. 

   

 (d) Exchange Agent Determination. The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the mutual determination of the Seller and the Company in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be binding as to whether or not Stock Elections have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 3.02 with respect to shares of Seller Common Stock and as to when Stock Elections and revocations were received by it. If the Exchange Agent reasonably determines in good faith that any Stock Election was not properly made with respect to shares of Seller Common Stock, such shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as shares which were not Electing Seller 

    ##### 

  

    

Shares at the Effective Time, and such shares shall be converted in the Merger
into (i) the right to receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section
3.01(b)(i) with respect to forty-five percent (45%) of such shares and (ii)
the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(ii)
with respect to fifty-five percent (55%) or such shares, subject to proration
as provided in Section 3.03. The Exchange Agent (or the Seller and the Company
by mutual agreement in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any
such determination) shall also make all computations as to the allocation and
the proration contemplated by Section 3.03, and any such computation shall be
conclusive and binding on the stockholders of the Seller. The Exchange Agent
may, with the mutual written agreement of the Seller and the Company, make
such rules as are consistent with this Section 3.02 for the implementation of
the Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement and as shall be necessary
or desirable to fully effect such Stock Elections. 

   

 _Section 3.03._ _Proration_. 

  

 (a) Proration Requirements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock (the _"Total Stock Election Number"_ ) to be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration in the Merger shall be equal to forty-five percent (45%) of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger (the _"Total Cash Number"_ ) shall be equal to (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, less (ii) the sum of (A) the Total Stock Election Number, and (B) the number of Dissenting Shares, if any;  _provided, however_ , that, in the event that the Electing Number shall be less than the Total Stock Election Number, the Company may, in its sole discretion, increase the Total Cash Number by an amount up to (but not to exceed) the amount of any such difference; _provided further, however_ , that the Company shall not increase the Total Cash Number by an amount that would prevent either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.02(c) or the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.03(c) from being rendered because the firm charged with providing such opinion reasonably determines that, as a result of such increase in the Total Cash Number, the Merger may not satisfy the continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code. To the extent the Company exercises its right to increase the amount of the Total Cash Number as described in this Section 3.03(a), the Parties acknowledge and agree that such increased amount shall be deemed the "Total Cash Number" as used in this Section 3.03, and the amount of the Total Stock Election Number shall be correspondingly decreased and the resulting decreased amount of the Total Stock Election Number shall be deemed the "Total Stock Election Number" as used in this Section 3.03. 

   

 (b) Procedure for Decreasing Stock Election Number. If the aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock in respect of which Stock Elections have been made (the _"Electing Number"_ ) exceeds the Total Stock Election Number, each Electing Seller Share shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or the Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of Section 3.01 in the following manner: 

   

 (i) if any Person shall have effectively made, and not subsequently revoked or lost, a Stock Election with respect to exactly forty-five percent (45%) of all of such Persons shares of Seller Common Stock (a " _Qualifying Stock Election_ "), each share of Seller Common Stock with respect to which such Qualifying Stock Election has been made shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration; 

  

 (ii) a proration factor (the _"Stock Proration Factor"_ ) shall be determined by dividing (A) the difference obtained by subtracting the aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock with respect to which a Qualifying Stock Election has been made (the " _Total Qualifying Stock_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Election Number_ ") from the Total Stock Election Number by (B) the
difference obtained by subtracting the Total Qualifying Stock Election Number
from the Electing Number; 

  

 (iii) the number of Electing Seller Shares covered by each Stock Election that is not a Qualifying Stock Election (a " _Non-Qualifying Stock Election_ ") that shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration shall be determined by multiplying the Stock Proration Factor by the total number of Electing Seller Shares covered by such Non-Qualifying Stock Election; and 

  

 (iv) all Electing Seller Shares, other than those shares converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration in accordance with Section 3.03(b)(i) or Section 3.03(b)(iii), shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration (on a consistent basis among stockholders of the Seller who made Stock Elections, pro rata to the respective numbers of shares of Seller Common Stock as to which they made such Stock Elections) as if such shares were not Electing Seller Shares, in accordance with the terms of Section 3.01(b)(ii). 

  

 (c) Procedure for Increasing Stock Election Number. If the number of shares (the _"Non-Electing Number"_ ) of Seller Common Stock as to which no Stock Elections were made, other than Seller Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares (such shares, the _"Non-Electing Shares"_ ), exceeds the Total Cash Number (as the same may be increased as provided in Section 3.03(a)), each Non-Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock or cash in accordance with the terms of Section 3.01 in the following manner: 

   

 (i) if any Person shall have made a Qualifying Stock Election, each Non-Electing Share (each, a " _Qualifying Non-Electing Share_ ") held by such Person shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; 

  

 (ii) a proration factor (the _"Cash Proration Factor"_ ) shall be determined by dividing (A) the difference obtained by subtracting the aggregate number of Qualifying Non-Electing Shares (the " _Total Qualifying Cash Number_ ") from the Total Cash Number by (B) the difference obtained by subtracting the Total Qualifying Cash Number from the Non-Electing Number; 

  

 (iii) the number of Non-Electing Shares other than Qualifying Non-Electing Shares (the " _Non-Qualifying Non-Electing Shares_ ") to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be determined by multiplying the Cash Proration Factor by the total number of Non-Qualifying Non-Electing Shares; and 

  

 (iv) all Non-Electing Shares, other than those converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 3.03(c)(i) or Section 3.03(c)(iii), shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (on a consistent basis among stockholders of the Seller who held Non-Qualifying Non-Electing Shares, pro rata to the respective number of Non-Qualifying Non-Electing Shares) as if such shares were Electing Seller Shares, in accordance with the terms of Section 3.01(b)(i). 

  

 _Section 3.04._ _Adjustment for Dilution and Other Matters_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock or Seller Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Seller Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. In the event that the sum of (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock presented for exchange pursuant to this Article III or otherwise issued and outstanding at the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, and (ii) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of Seller Stock Options or other Rights (whether pursuant to
Seller Stock Options or otherwise) as of the Effective Time, shall be greater
than the sum of (x) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof, and (y) the number of shares of Seller
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Seller Stock Options or other Rights
as of the date hereof, each as set forth in Section 5.03(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately decreased to take into account such additional issued and
outstanding, or issuable, shares of Seller Common Stock. If, between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall consolidate with or merge
into any other corporation and the terms thereof shall provide that Company
Common Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any other
corporation or entity, then provision shall be made as part of the terms of
such consolidation or merger so that stockholders of the Seller who would be
entitled to receive shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Company Common Stock
issuable to such stockholders as provided herein, the same kind and amount of
securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such consolidation or
merger with respect to one share of Company Common Stock. 

  

 _Section 3.05._ _Exchange Fund_. The Company shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Seller Common Stock, at or prior to the Effective Time, certificates representing the Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock. The Company shall maintain cash sufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and, as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.09 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.07. Any certificates of Company Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the  _"Exchange Fund."_  

  

 _Section 3.06._ _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate who has not surrendered the Certificate representing all of the shares of Seller Common Stock owned by such holder pursuant to Section 3.02 (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as the Company may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Company Common Stock (which may be, at the election of the Company, in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 (after taking into account all shares of Seller Common Stock then held by such holder), and (B) a check for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration (subject to the proration provisions of Section 3.03) and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.09 and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.07. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or pursuant to Section 3.07 or Section 3.09. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Seller Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Seller, one or more shares of Company Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Company Common Stock and a check for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.09 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.07, may be issued with respect to such Seller Common Stock to such a transferee if the 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate representing such shares of Seller Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Persons who have made an effective Stock Election as provided
in Section 3.02 and Section 3.03 and surrendered Certificates as provided
therein shall be treated as if they have properly surrendered
Certificates together with the letter of transmittal pursuant to this Section
3.06. 

  

 _Section 3.07._ _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.06. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date prior to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 _Section 3.08._ _No Further Rights in Seller Common Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Seller Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.07 or Section 3.09) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Seller Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article III, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 3.09._ _No Fractional Shares of Company Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip or shares of Company Common Stock representing fractional shares of Company Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or a holder of shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Seller Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Company Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

 _Section 3.10._ _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company or otherwise on the instruction of the Company and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and the Company for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Seller Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01 Section 3.06, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.09 and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.07. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as 

   ##### 

  

    

such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any United
States federal, state or local or any foreign government, or political
subdivision thereof, or any multinational organization or authority or any
authority, agency or commission entitled to exercise any administrative,
executive, judicial, legislative, police, regulatory (including any
Regulatory Authority) or taxing authority or power, any court or tribunal (or
any department, bureau or division thereof), or any arbitrator or arbitral
body (each a _"Governmental Authority"_ ), shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 _Section 3.11._ _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Seller, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 _Section 3.12._ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Seller Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Company Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 3.13._ _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Seller Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Seller Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Taxing authority. 

  

 _Section 3.14._ _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Seller or the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Seller or the Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 _Section 3.15._ _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Seller shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Seller Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Seller. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Seller Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.09 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.07. 

  

 _Section 3.16._ _Seller Stock Options_. The Seller shall take all action reasonably necessary so that, on or before the Closing Date, each holder of a stock option (the _"Seller Stock Options"_ ) heretofore granted under the Seller Stock Option Plans or pursuant to any employment or other agreement shall 

    ##### 

 

  

exercise such Seller Stock Option in accordance with its terms or exchange
it with the Seller as described in Section 6.13 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule; _provided, however_ , that in the event that any such
Seller Stock Options shall remain outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, then each such Seller Stock Option shall be exchanged for an
amount of cash equal to $0.01 and at the Effective Time each such Seller
Stock Option shall become null and void and of no further force or effect.

On or prior to the date hereof, the Seller has delivered to the Company a schedule (the _"Seller Disclosure Schedule"_ ) and the Company may have delivered to the Seller a schedule (the _"Company Disclosure Schedule"_ ), each setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Section 5.03, in the case of the Seller, or Section 5.04, in the case of the Company; _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty of a Party if its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related representation or warranty of such Party being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 5.02, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty of a Party shall not be deemed an admission by such Party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item would result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, in the case of the Seller, or a Company Material Adverse Effect, in the case of the Company. Each Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the Section numbers contained in this Article V. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any item or matter disclosed on any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for all purposes including on all other sections of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it should have been disclosed on such other section of the Disclosure Schedules and to the extent that sufficient details are set forth so that the purpose for which disclosure is made is sufficiently clear. 

  

 _Section 5.02._ _Standard_. No representation or warranty of the Seller contained in Section 5.03 (other than the representations and warranties in Section 5.03(c), Section 5.03(p) and Section 5.03(q) which shall be true and correct in all respects) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the Seller shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.03 has had or would have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. No representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 5.04 (other than the representations and warranties in Section 5.04(i) which shall be true and correct in all respects) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the Company shall not be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.04 has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 5.03._ _Representations and Warranties of Seller_. Subject to Section 5.01 and Section 5.02, and except as Previously Disclosed, the Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Company:

the properties it now owns or holds under lease and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
business entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary. 

  

 (ii) Each of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has all Consents and Orders (the _"Seller Approvals"_ ) necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, including all required authorizations from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the _"FDIC"_ ), the OCC and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the _"IDFPR"_ ), and neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received any notice of any Proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any Seller Approvals.

 (b) Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Seller has heretofore furnished or made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Sellers Certificate of Incorporation and the Sellers By-Laws, each as amended or restated (the _"Seller Certificate"_ and the _"Seller By-Laws",_ respectively), and the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws, or other organizational documents, as the case may be, of each Seller Subsidiary, each as amended or restated (the _"Subsidiary Organizational Documents"_ ).

Except as described in Section 5.03(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in breach or violation of any of the provisions of the Seller Certificate, the Seller By-Laws or the Subsidiary Organizational Documents. 

   

 (c) Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Seller consists of 5,000,000 shares of Seller Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share. Section 5.03(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule describes, as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding, all of which were duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not issued in violation of any preemptive right of any Seller stockholder, (ii) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock held as treasury shares by the Seller, and (iii) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to outstanding Seller Stock Options issued pursuant to the Seller Stock Option Plans.

  ##### 

  

    

outstanding shares of common stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non assessable and owned beneficially and of record by the Seller.
Except as set forth above in this Section 5.03(c), as described in Section
5.03(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or as Previously Disclosed,

or otherwise) authorized, issued or outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries
have been issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state
securities Laws or in accordance with exemptions therefrom. Except as set
forth in clause (iii) above, there are no outstanding Rights relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or
obligating the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or other securities of or in the Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Seller
or any Seller Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of Seller Common Stock or the capital stock of any Seller Subsidiary
or to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in any Seller Subsidiary or any other
Person, except for loan commitments and other funding obligations entered
into in the ordinary course of business. Neither the Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary has repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any of its shares
of capital stock since December 31, 2004. Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Seller Subsidiary is not issued in violation of any
preemptive rights of any Seller Subsidiary stockholder or other equity
holder, and such shares owned by the Seller are owned free and clear of all
limitations of the Sellers voting rights and Liens whatsoever.

No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, the Seller Certificate and the Seller By-Laws). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Seller and is enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity, and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally.

The Company Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. The Company meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3, as set forth in the general instructions for Form S-3.

Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for the periods indicated,
except (i) for any statement therein or omission therefrom which was
corrected, amended or supplemented or otherwise disclosed or updated in a
subsequent Company SEC Report, and (ii) that any unaudited interim financial
statements do not contain all of the disclosures required by GAAP and were
or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or
are not expected to be material in amount, either individually or in the
aggregate. 

  

 (iii) To the Companys Knowledge, the Company and each of its officers and directors have complied in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended, and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 

  

 (h) Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the registration statement of the Company (the  _"Registration Statement"_ ) pursuant to which the shares of Company Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered with the SEC will not, at the time the Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, at the time of the Seller Stockholders Meeting and at the Effective Time, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact required to be stated therein, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company will promptly inform the Seller. The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (to the extent applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information about, or supplied or omitted by, the Seller which is contained in any of the foregoing documents. 

   

 (i) Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Co., Inc.) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. 

   

 (j) Approval Delays. To the Companys Knowledge as of the date hereof, there is no reason why the granting of any Consents or Orders necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and referred to in Section 6.02 would be denied or unduly delayed. Each Company Subsidiary that is a "depository institution" as defined in the FDIA has a recent CRA rating of "satisfactory" or better. 

   

 (k) Financial Resources. The Company will have sufficient cash available at the Effective Time to enable it to comply with its obligation to fund the Cash Consideration under Section 3.05. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (l) Company Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2006, there has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and shall cause each of their executive officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, and other advisors or representatives to immediately cease, as of the date hereof, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any other Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, subject to the right to renew such activities, discussions or negotiations in accordance with this Section 6.06.

 (d) Exceptions. Except as provided below in this Section 6.06(d): (i) the Sellers Board of Directors shall recommend that the Sellers stockholders vote in favor of and to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Seller Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement of the Sellers Board of Directors Recommendation, and (iii) neither the Sellers Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company (in either event, a _"Change of Recommendation"_ ), the Sellers Board of Directors Recommendation;  _provided, however,_ that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Sellers Board of Directors from (1) withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying the Sellers Board of Directors Recommendation, or (2) not including in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the Sellers Board of Directors Recommendation if, in either case, the Sellers Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, due solely to facts or circumstances coming to the attention of the Sellers Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement, the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach by the Sellers Board of Directors of its fiduciary obligations to Sellers stockholders under applicable Law; and _provided further, however_ , that neither the Seller nor the Sellers Board of Directors may take any of the actions described in clauses (1) and (2) of the immediately preceding proviso unless the Seller shall have received an Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn as of the time of such action of the Sellers Board of Directors and the Sellers Board of Directors shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after taking into consideration the advice of and consultation with an investment banking firm of national reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer. 

   

 (e) Termination of Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.06, in the event that the Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior Offer it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Seller or the Sellers stockholders under applicable Law, the   ##### 

  

  

  

Sellers Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement in the manner
contemplated by Section 8.01(f) solely in order to concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer, but only after the
tenth (10th) day following the Companys receipt of written notice advising
the Company that the Sellers Board of Directors is prepared to accept a
Superior Offer, and only if, during such ten (10) day period, if the Company
so elects, the Seller and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith
with the Company to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Seller to proceed with the transactions
contemplated herein on such adjusted terms.

 _Section 6.12._ _Indemnification, Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Indemnification. By virtue of the occurrence of the Merger, the Company shall, from and after the Effective Time succeed to the Sellers obligation to, and the Company shall, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary determined as of the Effective Time (the _"Indemnified Parties"_ ), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, _"Costs"_ ) incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted, claimed or arising prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent to which such Indemnified Parties were entitled under the DGCL, the Seller Certificate or the Seller By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, and the Company shall also advance expenses as incurred to the extent permitted under the DGCL, the Seller Certificate or the Seller By-Laws; _provided however_ , that the obligations of the Company hereunder shall be subject to, and limited by, applicable federal Law, including Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and SR letter 02-17 issued by the Federal Reserve Board on July 8, 2002. 

   

 (b) Claims. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.12(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall as promptly as possible notify the Company thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the Company. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Company shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Company shall elect not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises in writing that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Company and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel for the Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction promptly as statements thereof are received, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and _provided, further,_ that the Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this Agreement is not permitted or is prohibited by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) Insurance. For a period of three (3) years after the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Seller ( _provided_ that the Company may substitute therefor policies of comparable coverage with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time), _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company be obligated   ##### 

  

  

  

to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to
this Section 6.12(c), any aggregate amount in excess of 200% of the amount of
the most recent annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the _"Maximum Amount"_ ). If the amount of the aggregate
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance
obtainable for an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
request the Seller to, and the Seller shall if so requested, purchase
insurance coverage, on such terms and conditions as shall be acceptable to the
Company, extending for a period of three (3) years the Sellers directors
and officers liability insurance coverage in effect as of the date hereof
(covering past or future claims with respect to periods before the Effective
Time) and such coverage shall satisfy the Companys obligations under
this Section 6.12(c). 

   

 (d) Successors. If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12. 

   

 _Section 6.13._ _Benefit Plans_. The Company shall, with respect to each employee of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who shall continue in employment with the Company or a Company Subsidiary after the Merger (each a _"Continued Employee"_ ), provide the benefits described in this Section 6.13. Each Continued Employee shall be entitled, as an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, to participate in such employee benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any non-qualified employee benefit plans or deferred compensation, stock option, bonus or incentive plans, or other employee benefit or fringe benefit programs that may be in effect generally for employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the _"Company Employee Plans"_ ), subject to the Companys right, in its sole discretion, to subsequently amend, modify or terminate any such Company Employee Plans, if as a Continued Employee he or she shall be eligible and, if required, selected for participation therein under the terms thereof and otherwise shall not be participating in a similar Seller Benefit Plan maintained by the Company after the Effective Time. Continued Employees shall be eligible to participate on the same basis as similarly situated employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Except as otherwise provided herein, all such participation shall be subject to such terms of such Company Employee Plans as may be in effect from time to time, and this Section 6.13 is not intended to, and shall not, give Continued Employees any rights or privileges superior to those of other employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The Company may terminate or modify all Seller Benefit Plans except insofar as benefits thereunder shall have vested at the Effective Time and cannot be modified, and the Companys obligation under this Section 6.13 shall not be deemed or construed so as to provide duplication of similar benefits but, subject to that qualification, the Company shall, for purposes of vesting and any age or period of service requirements for commencement of participation with respect to any Company Employee Plans in which Continued Employees may participate (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan), credit each Continued Employee with his or her term of service with the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries; and _provided_  that a Continued Employee shall not be subject to any waiting periods or preexisting condition exclusions under a Company Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, other than waiting periods and exclusions that are already in effect with respect to such Continued Employee and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any Seller Benefit Plan of a similar type in which the Continued Employee participated in immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent that the initial period of coverage for Continued Employees under any Company Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full 12-month period of coverage, Continued Employees shall be given credit under the applicable 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Employee Plan for any deductibles and co-insurance payments made
by such Continued Employees under the Sellers benefit plans during the
balance of such 12-month period of coverage. In connection with the
transition of the Continued Employees to the Company Employee Plans, Seller
and the Seller Subsidiaries shall take such actions as the Company
may request to terminate, freeze or amend all or certain of the Seller
Benefit Plans in the manner requested by the Company, effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time or such other time requested by the Company
(provided such actions are conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger). Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth certain
additional agreements of the Parties with respect to various benefit and
compensation matters. The Seller shall not amend the Executive Agreements
prior to or on the Closing Date. 

  

 _Section 6.14._ _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 _Section 6.15._ _Directorship_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as may be reasonably required to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to be expanded by one member and to appoint the person identified in Section 2.05 as a director of the Company. 

  

 _Section 6.16._ _Comfort Letters_. If requested in writing by the Company, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company "comfort" letters of Plante and Moran, PLLC, the Sellers independent public accounting firm, dated the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and the Effective Time, respectively, and addressed to the Company, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and reasonably customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accounting firms in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement and transactions such as those contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 6.17._ _Subsidiary Mergers or Reorganizations; Transition Matters_. Upon the request of the Company, (i) the Seller shall cause Mount Prospect National Bank to enter into a merger agreement with Midwest Bank and Trust Company, and take all other actions and cooperate with the Company in causing the merger of Mount Prospect National Bank and Midwest Bank and Trust Company (the _"Subsidiary Bank Merger"_ ) to be effected, and (ii) the Seller shall cause one or more of the Seller Subsidiaries (other than Mount Prospect National Bank) to reorganize or otherwise combine its operations with the operations of a Company Subsidiary or a Seller Subsidiary as deemed advisable by the Company, and take all other actions and cooperate with the Company in causing such reorganization or other combination (the _"Subsidiary Reorganization"_ ) to be effected; _provided, however_ , that (1) any such Subsidiary Bank Merger or Subsidiary Reorganization shall be consummated on a date on or after the Closing Date, as may be selected by the Company, and (2) the obligations of Mount Prospect National Bank or the Seller Subsidiary, as applicable, thereunder shall be conditioned upon the prior or simultaneous consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller also shall consult and confer with the Company on a regular basis (and, to that end, the Seller shall make personnel available as reasonably necessary) regarding the various systems, procedures, business relationships and best practices employed by each organization, together with the Sellers data processing systems and Contracts, in order to effect, on or after the Closing Date as determined by the Company, the orderly transition and integration of the business and operations of the Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries with the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the timely conversion of the Sellers data processing systems to those of the Company and, if requested by the Company, the termination by the Seller of any Contracts the Seller may have with third parties related to Sellers data processing or other operations; _provided, however_ that neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary shall be required to take 

   ##### 

  

    

any action with respect to any such conversion or termination until
immediately prior to the Closing and until such time as the Seller shall have
received reasonable written assurances that all conditions precedent to the
Closing have been satisfied or waived as provided in Article VII (other than
the completion of actions to be taken at the Closing, with respect to which
the Seller shall have received reasonable written assurances that the Company
will complete such actions at the Closing). 

  

 _Section 6.18._ _Conforming Accounting and Reserve Policies_. From and after the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Seller and the Company shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to their respective accounting policies and practices and in determining the amount and the timing of the expenses of the Merger and the restructuring charges related to or to be incurred in connection with the Merger. At the request of the Company, the Seller shall establish and take such reserves, accruals and charges as the Company shall request to (i) conform the Sellers loan, accrual and reserve policies to the Companys policies, (ii) conform to the accounting policies and practice of the Company in respect of excess facilities and equipment capacity, severance costs, litigation matters, write-off or write-down of various assets and other appropriate accounting adjustments, and (iii) recognize for financial accounting purposes such expenses of the Merger and restructuring charges related to or to be incurred in connection with the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall not be required to take any such action that is not consistent with GAAP; _and provided further, however_ that neither the Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action until immediately prior to the Closing or until such time as the Seller shall have received reasonable written assurances that all conditions precedent to the Closing have been satisfied or waived as provided in Article VII (other than the completion of actions to be taken at the Closing, with respect to which the Seller shall have received reasonable written assurances that the Company will complete such actions at the Closing). 

  

 _Section 6.19._ _Disclosure Schedules_. Where any of the specific representations or warranties of the Seller contained in Section 5.03 requires a list or itemization of a certain item or items, the Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to provide such list or itemization without regard to the standard set forth in Section 5.02. 

  

 _Section 6.20._ _Updated Financial Statements_. The Seller shall use its best efforts to, on or prior to April 25, 2007, deliver to the Company (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 (including related notes and schedules, if any), of the Seller, (ii) the audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006 (including related notes and schedules, if any), of the Seller, and (iii) the audited consolidated statements of cash flows and stockholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2006, (including related notes and schedules, if any), of the Seller (the " _Seller 2006 Financial Statements_ "), together with the unqualified audit opinion thereon as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

(i) By the Company: (1) if any of the conditions to the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 have not been satisfied or waived by the Company at the Closing or the Company reasonably determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition to the obligation of the Company to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 has become impossible (other than as a result of any failure on the part of the Company to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in this Agreement); or (2) in the event there has been a Seller Material Adverse Effect between the date hereof and the Effective Time; or (ii) by the Seller: (1) if any of the conditions to the obligation of the Seller to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 have not been satisfied or waived by the Seller at the Closing or the Seller reasonably determines that the timely satisfaction of any condition to the obligation of the Seller to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 has become impossible (other than as a result of any failure on the part of the Seller to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of the Seller set forth in this Agreement); or (2) in the event there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect between the date hereof and the Effective Time.

EXHIBIT A 

   

FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER  

  

Midwest Banc Holdings, Inc. 
 501 W. North Avenue 
 Melrose Park, Illinois 60160  

  

Attn: James J. Giancola  

  

Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Northwest Suburban Bancorp., Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Seller"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 22, 2007 (the "Agreement"), among Midwest Banc Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Seller, the Seller will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). 

  

 As a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Securities"). I would receive such shares in exchange for shares owned by me of the Sellers common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Seller Securities"). 

  

 I represent, warrant and covenant to the Company that in the event I receive any Company Securities as a result of the Merger: 

  

 A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Company Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 B. I have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company Securities, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Seller. 

  

 C. I have been advised that the issuance of Company Securities to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Seller, I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Seller and the distribution by me of the Company Securities has not been registered under the Act, and that I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Company Securities issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

  

 D. I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Company Securities by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the Companys transfer agents with respect to the Company Securities and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Company Securities issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

    ##### 

  

      

 "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED _ _, 2007 BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND THE COMPANY, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF THE COMPANY." 

  

 F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Company Securities has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, the Company reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

 "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraph E and F, above, shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to the Company a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Act.
