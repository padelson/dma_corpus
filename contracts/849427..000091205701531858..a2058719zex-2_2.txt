Sub-Lease Agreement Exhibit C-Warrant Term Sheet       STOCK PURCHASE
AGREEMENT    STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of July 1, 2001  (this
"AGREEMENT"), among EMAP PLC ("PARENT"), a  corporation organized under the
laws of the United  Kingdom, EMAP AMERICA PARTNERS, a Delaware general 
partnership ("SELLER"), EMAP, INC., a Delaware  corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Seller  ("BALBOA" and, excluding the FHM Business (as
defined  below), the "COMPANY") and PRIMEDIA INC., a Delaware  corporation
("PURCHASER").    Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller
desires to sell to Purchaser, all the issued and out standing shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "SHARES"), of the Company on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   Accordingly, the
parties hereby agree as follows:    ARTICLE I   PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE
SHARES; CLOSING; AND POST-CLOSING  PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT   SECTION
1.01. PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined in Section 1.03),
Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase from Seller, the Shares for an aggregate purchase price of
$505,000,000 plus warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Purchaser\'s
common stock on substantially the terms set forth on Exhibit C hereto (the
"WARRANTS") (collectively, the "PURCHASE PRICE"), subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 1.07. Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price on the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.03) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts designated in writing by Seller one business day
before the Closing Date and by delivery of the Warrants. The purchase of the
Shares is referred to herein as the "ACQUISITION".   SECTION 1.02. CERTAIN
TRANSFERS OF ASSETS. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall effect such transfers
as are necessary to remove all Excluded Assets and all excluded employees as
set forth on Schedule 1.01(a) (the "EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES") from the Company and
the Excluded Assets shall     2   not be sold, conveyed or delivered to
Purchaser and the Excluded Employees shall no longer be employed by the
Company and its subsidiaries after the Closing. Notwith standing anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the term "COMPANY", or any derivation
thereof, including the phrases "the Company or its subsidiaries" or "the
Company and its subsidiaries" shall be deemed to not include, in any way, the
Excluded Assets or the Excluded Employees prior to or after such transfers.
As used in this Agreement the term "EXCLUDED ASSETS" shall mean (i) all cash
or cash equivalents and (ii) all the right, title and interest in the
properties, assets, goodwill and rights of whatever kind and nature, real or
personal, tangible or intangible, that are owned, leased or licensed
by Balboa or its subsidiaries and used or held for use primarily in the
operation or conduct of the business of producing, marketing or distributing
the FHM magazine and the FHM digital services (the "FHM BUSINESS"),
including:   (a) office and other supplies and vehicles and equipment used 
or held for use primarily in connection with the operation or  conduct of the
FHM Business;   (b) the inventories of the FHM Business, and raw
materials,  wrappings, supply and packaging items relating thereto;   (c)
all books of account, ledgers, general, financial,  accounting and personnel
records, files, customers and suppliers  lists, prospect lists, sub scription
or circulation lists, sales and  promotional literature, customer and
supplier correspondence,  manuals, files, data, papers, personnel and
employment records and  other information, whether in hard copy or computer
or other format  (collectively "RECORDS"), in each case primarily relating to
the FHM  Business;   (d) any contract, lease, sublease, license,
agreement,  purchase order or other commitment or arrangement, written or 
unwritten, ("CONTRACT") that is used or held for use primarily in  the
operation or conduct of the FHM Business;   (e) all Intellectual Property
(as defined in Section 2.10(c))  primarily relating to the FHM Business,
including the Intellectual  Property listed on Schedule 1.01(e)(the "FHM
INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY");   (f) all Permits that are used or held for use
primarily in the  conduct or operation of the FHM Business;      
3    (g) all receivables constituting the right to receive payments  in
respect of goods or services as and to the extent arising out of  or relating
to the operation or conduct of the FHM Business;   (h) all goodwill
generated by or associated with the FHM  Business;   (i) all credits,
prepaid expenses, deferred charges, advance  payments, security deposits and
pre paid items as and to the extent  used or held for use in, or that arise
out of, the operation or  conduct of the FHM Business;   (j) all other
tangible and intangible assets of Balboa and its  subsidiaries primarily
related to the FHM Business; and   (k) all subscriptions in connection with
the FHM Business,  including subscriptions for the FHM magazine and the FHM
digital  services.   SECTION 1.03. CLOSING DATE. The closing of the
Acquisition (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine and Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m. on
the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted, the waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article V, or at such
other place, time and date as may be agreed by Seller and Purchaser. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "CLOSING
DATE". The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.   SECTION 1.04. TRANSACTIONS TO BE EFFECTED AT
THE CLOSING. At the Closing:   (a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
certificates  representing the Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied
by  stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer and 
with all necessary stock transfer stamps attached thereto and  canceled;  
(b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, in the manner set forth  in Section
1.01, immediately available funds in an amount equal to  the cash portion of
the Purchase Price plus or minus an estimate,  reasonably prepared by Seller
and delivered to Purchaser at least  two business days prior to the Closing
Date, of any adjustment to  the Purchase Price under Section 1.07 (the cash
portion of the  Purchase Price plus or minus       4    such
estimate of any adjustment under Section 1.07 being hereinafter  called the
"CLOSING DATE PAYMENT");   (c) Purchaser shall deliver the Warrants to
Seller, and a duly  executed Warrant Agreement (the "WARRANT AGREEMENT")
substantially  on the terms set forth in Exhibit C hereto; and   (d) at the
option of Purchaser, the shares of Emap Digital  shall be transferred to any
affiliate of Purchaser at the Closing.   SECTION 1.05. EXCLUSION OF
LIABILITIES. Notwith standing any provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Excluded Liabilities shall not be assumed by Purchaser and all
such Excluded Liabilities shall be retained by and shall be obligations and
commitments of Parent and its sub sidiaries (other than the Company and its
subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the term "Company," or any derivation thereof, including the phrases "the
Company or its subsidiaries" or "the Company and its subsidiaries" shall be
deemed to not include, in any way, the Excluded Liabilities prior to or after
such trans fers. As used in this Agreement, the term "EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"
shall mean any liability, obligation or commitment of Balboa or its
subsidiaries that relates primarily to, or arises primarily out of any
Excluded Asset or arises out of the distribution of such Excluded Asset to
Parent or its subsidiaries (except the Company or its sub sidiaries)
in accordance with the first sentence of Section 1.02.   SECTION 1.06.
PARTIAL TRANSFER. In the case of Contracts that do not constitute Excluded
Assets, but which relate to the FHM Business, the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable best efforts to assign to Parent or its subsidiaries (other
than the Company or its subsidiaries) that portion of such Contracts as and
to the extent it relates to the FHM Business. In the event that such
assignments cannot be obtained, Purchaser and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to effect such alternative arrangements as may be required to
ensure that the FHM Business is provided with the services or licenses that
are the subject of such Contracts by a vendor reasonably acceptable to Parent
and in substantially the same manner as provided to the FHM Business prior to
the Closing Date. The cost for any such service or the fee for any such
license shall be paid by the FHM Business in accordance with the Transition
Services Agreement. The set-up cost, if any, for engaging any
such alternative arrangement shall be shared equally by the FHM Business
and Purchaser. In furtherance       5   and not in limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Contracts set forth on
Schedule 1.06(a) shall be subject to this Section 1.06.   SECTION 1.07.
POST-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. (a) THE STATEMENT. Within 60 days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the "STATEMENT"), setting forth the Working Capital (as defined in
Section 1.07(d)) as of the close of business at the end of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date ("CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL") determined
in accordance with the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet (as defined in Section
2.07)(except as provided on Schedule 1.07). After the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall assist, and shall cause the Company and its subsidiaries to assist,
Parent and its representatives in the preparation of the Statement and shall
provide Parent and its representatives any information reasonably requested
and shall provide them access at all reasonable times to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries for such
purpose.   (b) OBJECTIONS; RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. (1) Unless
Purchaser notifies Parent in writing within 30 days after Parent\'s delivery
of the Statement of any objection to any component of the computation of
Closing Working Capital set forth therein (the "NOTICE OF OBJECTION"), such
computation shall be final and binding. During such 30-day period Purchaser
and its representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of
Parent relating to the Statement. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein and shall
include a special purpose report of Deloitte and Touche ("PURCHASER\'S
ACCOUNTANTS") stating that they concur with the matters set forth in such
Notice of Objection and that such Notice of Objection has been prepared in
accordance with this Section 1.07. Any Notice of Objection shall include only
objections based on (i) mathematical errors in the computation of Closing
Working Capital or (ii) Closing Working Capital not having been calculated in
accordance with the consistent application of the accounting principles,
practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Balance
Sheet (after taking into consideration the provisions of Schedule 1.07).
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that (i) the sole purpose of the
determination of Closing Working Capital is to adjust the Closing
Date Payment so as to reflect the change in Working Capital resulting only
from the operation of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and
(ii) such change can be       6   measured only if the calculation
is done using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies as those used in preparing the Balance Sheet (except as provided on
Schedule 1.07).   (2) If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to
Parent within such 30-day period, Purchaser and Parent shall, during the
15-day period following Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt
in good faith to resolve Purchaser\'s objections. During such 15-day period,
Parent and its representatives shall be permitted to review the working
papers of Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Accountants relating to the Notice of
Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and Parent are unable to
resolve all such objections within such 15-day period, the matters remaining
in dispute shall be submitted to Arthur Andersen (or, if such firm declines
to act, to another nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by Purchaser and Parent and, if Purchaser and Parent are unable
to so agree within 10 days after the end of such 15-day period, then
Purchaser and Parent shall each select such a firm and such firms shall
jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to resolve the disputed
matters (such determining firm being the "INDEPENDENT EXPERT")). The parties
shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its written decision as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after its
selection. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall
be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable
and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction
thereover. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Parent. After final determination of Closing Working
Capital, Purchaser shall have no further right to make any claims against
Parent or Seller in respect of any element of Closing Working Capital that
Purchaser raised, or could have raised, in the Notice of Objection.   (c)
ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT. Subject to Section 1.07(f), the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital exceeds negative
$8,385,000 (the "TARGET WORKING CAPITAL"), and the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less than the
Target Working Capital (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased being
herein after called the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE"). Within 10 days after the
Closing Working Capital has been finally determined in accordance
with Section 1.07(b), (i) if the Closing Date Payment is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Parent by wire transfer to
an       7   account specified by Parent in immediately available
funds an amount equal to such difference, plus interest thereon at a rate of
6% per annum, compounded every three months, and calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date
to the date of payment, and (ii) if the Closing Date Payment is greater than
the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser by wire transfer
to an account specified by Purchaser in immediately available funds an amount
equal to such difference, plus interest thereon at a rate of 6% per annum,
compounded every three months, and calculated on the basis of a year of 365
days and the actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the date
of payment (the Closing Date Payment as so increased or decreased being
hereinafter called the "SHARES PURCHASE PRICE").   (d) WORKING CAPITAL. The
term "WORKING CAPITAL" means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. The
terms (i) "CURRENT ASSETS" means total current assets exclusive of cash and
cash equivalents but including the non-current portion of deferred
subscription acquisition costs and (ii) "CURRENT LIABILITIES" means the total
current liabilities exclusive of (x) subject to Section 4.18, all liabilities
with respect to Kick Media Corporation and (y) any employee benefits and
related costs payable as a direct result of the Acquisition with respect to
the individuals listed on Schedule 2.06(e) but including the non-current
portion of unearned subscription revenues, of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries, calculated in the same way, using the same
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies, as the
line items comprising current assets and current liabilities, respectively,
on the Balance Sheet (except as provided on Schedule 1.07). For the avoidance
of doubt, the allowance for doubtful debts shall be calculated in accordance
with the accounting principles, practices and methodologies set forth on
Schedule 1.07. Current Assets and Current Liabilities relating to Income
Taxes (as defined in Section 2.13(a)) and deferred taxes shall not be taken
into account in determining Working Capital.   (e) POST-CLOSING BOOKS AND
RECORDS. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall not take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries on which the Statement is to be based that is not consistent
with the past practices of the Company and its subsidiaries. Without limiting
the general ity of the foregoing, no changes shall be made in any reserve or
other account existing as of the date of the Balance Sheet except as a result
of events occurring after the date of the Balance Sheet and, in such event,
only in a       8   manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company and its subsidiaries.   (f) POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT THRESHOLD.
Notwith standing the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.07, no adjustment
to the Closing Date Payment pursuant to this Section 1.07 shall be made
unless such adjustment would exceed $100,000 and, if the adjustment would
exceed $100,000, then the full amount of the adjustment shall be made.  
(g) The parties acknowledge that Seller intends to cause all cash and cash
equivalents held by the Company and its subsidiaries to be distributed to
Seller. To the extent that (i) any such cash and cash equivalents are not so
distributed prior to the Closing, there shall be an upward adjustment to the

1.07(b)(2), except that every effort shall be made by the parties and the
Independent Expert to resolve the dispute prior to the due date for
the applicable Tax Return.   (c) TRANSFER TAX RETURNS. Purchaser shall pay
all Transfer Taxes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each of Parent, Seller, the
Company and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the
other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemption.   (d) AMENDED TAX RETURNS. After the
Closing Date, the Company and its subsidiaries shall not, without the prior
written consent of Seller and Parent, file any amended Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period if Seller would be liable for additional Taxes on such
return under Section 7.01.   (e) COOPERATION. Seller, the Company and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the
Company or its subsidiaries, including maintaining and making available to
each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to
Taxes. Seller and its affiliates will need access, from time to time after
the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held
by the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent such records and
information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore,
Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause each subsidiary of the
Company to, (i) use its best efforts to properly retain and maintain such
records until such time as Parent and Seller agree that such retention and
maintenance is no longer necessary, and (ii) allow Parent and Seller and
their       36   agents and representatives (and agents or
representatives of any of their affiliates), upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as
Parent and Seller may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt normal
operations of Purchaser or the Company and its subsidiaries.   (f) REFUNDS
AND CREDITS. Any refund or credit of Income Taxes of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Seller. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any refunds or credits it
has received for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any refund or credit of Income
Taxes of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (a "POST- CLOSING TAX
PERIOD") shall be for the account of Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if Seller so
requests and at Seller\'s expense, cause the Company or any of
its subsidiaries to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to which
Seller is entitled under this Section 4.07(f). Purchaser and the Company
shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund claim. If
Seller pays (or causes the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay prior to
the Closing Date) estimated Income Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of
the amount ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and Purchaser obtains the benefit of such
excess payment, Purchaser shall promptly refund such excess to the
Seller.   (g) TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. Seller shall cause the provisions of
any Tax sharing agreement between Seller or any of its affiliates (other
than the Company and its subsidiaries), and the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such
Tax sharing agreement.   (h) CLOSING DATE. On the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause the Company and each subsidiary of the Company to conduct its
business in the ordinary course in sub stantially the same manner as
presently conducted and on the Closing Date shall not permit the Company or
any of its sub sidiaries to effect any extraordinary transactions (other than
any such transactions expressly required by Applicable Law or by this
Agreement) that could result in Tax liability to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in excess of Tax liability associated with the conduct of its
business in the ordinary course.        37    (i) FIRPTA
CERTIFICATE. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing a certificate
in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that such Seller is exempt from withholding under
Section 1445 of the Code.   (j) Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to agree within 60 days following the Closing Date as to the value of
the Warrants on the Closing Date. If Purchaser and Seller cannot agree, the
dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Expert under the principles of
Section 1.07(b)(2).   (k) SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTIONS. On or prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller of its intent for Purchaser and
Seller to make elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code. If such
notification is made, Purchaser and Seller shall (i) join in making elections
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "TREASURY REGULATIONS") and
any comparable election under state or local Tax law with respect to the
Company and each of the subsidiaries listed on Schedule 2.02 subpart A
(collectively, the "PURCHASED ENTITIES") (the "ELECTIONS"); (ii) provide to
the other the necessary information to permit the Elections to be made; and
(iii) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, take all actions
necessary and appropriate (including filing any necessary forms, returns,
elections, schedules and other documents) as may be required to effect and
preserve timely Elections.   (i) PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS. If Purchaser
notifies Seller of its intent to make the Elections on or prior to Closing,
(i) within 120 calendar days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller (A) a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Purchased Entities and (B) a completed IRS Form 8023 and the
required schedules thereto ("FORM 8023"), providing for the elections under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury
Regulations. If Seller disputes any of such allocations or any of the
computations reflected on Form 8023, Seller and Purchaser will attempt in
good faith to promptly agree on allocations and/or revised Form 8023. If the
parties cannot resolve any such dispute within 60 calendar days of the
delivery of such allocations and Form 8023, the items remaining in dispute
shall be submitted to the Independent Expert. Seller and Purchaser shall be
bound by the allocation of such items as determined by the Independent
Expert. The Independent Expert shall make any such determination within 30
calendar       38   days after submission of the remaining disputed
items. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne 50% by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and 50% by Seller, on the other hand.   (ii)
Purchaser and Seller agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the
elections, allocations and forms described in this Section 4.07. Purchaser
and Seller further agree not to take any position inconsistent therewith for
any Tax purpose.   SECTION 4.08. PUBLICITY. From the date hereof through
the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities
exchange; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each of the parties may make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with the
parties\' prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 4.09. RESIGNATIONS. On the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be delivered to Purchaser duly signed resignations (from
the applicable board of directors), effective immediately after the Closing,
of all directors of the Company and each of its subsidiaries who are not
employees of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and shall take such other
action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.   SECTION 4.10. NO USE
OF CERTAIN NAMES. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its
subsidiaries promptly, and in any event (a) within 30 days after the Closing,
to revise print advertising and labeling to delete and destroy all references
to the Names (as defined below) and (b) within 30 days after the Closing, to
change signage and stationery and otherwise discontinue use of the Names. In
no event shall Purchaser, the Company or its subsidiaries use any Names after
the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such
Names by the Company during the 30-day period preceding the Closing. With
respect to product inventory manufactured by the Company or its subsidiaries
prior to the Closing, the Company or its subsidiaries may continue to sell
such inventory, notwith standing that it bears one or more of the Names, for
a reasonable time after the Closing (not to exceed 60 days). Within 5 days
after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company and its subsidiaries to
file applications to amend       39   or terminate any certificate of
assumed name or d/b/a filings so as to eliminate the right of the Company and
its subsidiaries to use the Names. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause the names of the Company and its subsidiaries (to the extent they
make use of the Names) to be changed to names (that do not include the Names)
selected by Purchaser. "NAMES" means "EMAP", "METRO", and "FHM", any
variations and derivatives thereof and any other logos or trademarks of
Parent or Seller or its affiliates not included in Schedule 2.10.   SECTION
4.11. SUPPORT SERVICES. (a) Purchaser agrees that as of the Closing Date and
with respect to the Excluded Assets, it shall provide to Seller or its
subsidiary the support and other services with respect to the FHM Business as
more fully set forth in the Transition Services Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, which Agreement shall be entered into
by Parent, Seller and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date.   (b) Purchaser
acknowledges that as of the Closing Date, neither Parent nor Seller shall
have any obligation to provide any support or other services to Purchaser,
the Company or any of their subsidiaries (including any of the services for
which allocations were previously paid by the Company as set forth in the
notes to the Financial Statements).   SECTION 4.12. LITIGATION MATTERS.
Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into arrangements
such that on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser or the Company shall
assume full responsibility for (a) the prosecution, defense and/or settlement
and all other aspects of the administration of any suit, action, proceeding
or arbitration by or primarily against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
except in respect of the Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets (including
the matters set forth on Schedule 2.14) (collectively, the "ACTIONS") and (b)
the timely payment of any and all losses, damages, liabilities, obligations
or expenses related to or arising out of the Actions. After the Closing,
Seller shall (x) promptly deliver to Purchaser (or the Company if so
requested) the case files relating to the Actions and (y) provide reasonable
cooperation and assistance in connection with the assumption by Purchaser of
the Actions contemplated by this Section 4.12. Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney\'s fees and costs of investigation) incurred in assisting Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 4.12. Seller shall not be required by this Section
4.12 to take any action that would interfere with       40   the
conduct of its business or disrupt its normal operations. In the event
that Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its
subsidiaries) is a party to any Action, Seller may, at its own cost and
expense, continue to control the prosecution, defense and/or settlement and
all other aspects of the administration of that portion of such Action that
relates to Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its
subsidiaries).   SECTION 4.13. INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS. Except
as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, Parent, Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge and agree that, immediately prior to the Closing, all
Contracts (other than this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements)
between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or
Seller or any of their subsidiaries (exclusive of the Company and its
subsidiaries), on the other hand, including all intercompany loans, shall be
terminated or settled, as the case may be, and be of no further force or
effect, notwithstanding any terms thereof to the contrary. The parties agree
that the Max Power license shall be terminated without liability to Parent or
its subsidiaries prior to Closing.   SECTION 4.14. ACCOUNTS. All payments
and reimbursements received by Purchaser or its affiliates in connection with
or arising out of the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities after the
Closing shall be held by such person in trust for the benefit of Parent and
Seller and, immediately upon receipt by such person of any such payment or
reimbursement, such person shall pay over to Seller the amount of such
payment or reimbursement without right of set off.   SECTION 4.15. RECORDS.
On the Closing Date, Parent and Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to Purchaser all Records, if any, in the possession of Parent or Seller or

to, redact any information as and to the extent such  information relates to
the FHM Business or any other business other  than the Company\'s business
which is contained in any of the Records.   SECTION 4.16. SUB-LEASE. On
Closing, Purchaser, as sublessor, shall enter into a sub-lease substantially
in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B (the "SUB-LEASE") with Seller or its
designated subsidiary, as sublessee, with respect to a portion of the

reimburse Purchaser for all amounts drawn down by Kick Media Corporation with

shall, within 20 days following the discovery of the matters giving rise to
any Loss, notify the indemnifying party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing
of its claim for indemnification for such Loss, specifying in reasonable
detail the nature of such Loss and the amount of the liability estimated to
accrue therefrom; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to
give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Party\'s receipt

Indemnifying Party with respect to such Loss; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure
to make such delivery shall not affect the indemnification provided here
under except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.   If the indemnification sought
pursuant hereto involves a claim made by a third party (which shall
not       49   include Parent, Seller or any of their affiliates or
Purchaser or its affiliates) against the Indemnified Party (a "THIRD PARTY
CLAIM"), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party\'s
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by its terms
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim; PROVIDED that if such settlement,
compromise or discharge would impose a material order, material injunction or
other material non-monetary damages on the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim
without prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Whether or not the Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior
written consent.   (b) PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS.
(1) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section
7.01 of this Agreement (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), and the other party to
this Agreement (the "TAX INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives a notice of
deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination,
suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM") with respect (in whole or in
part) to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall notify the Tax
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 7.04(a).        50    (2) The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the applicable audit or
examination and the defense of a Tax Claim involving any Taxes for which it
has an obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
7.01 of this Agreement, and the Tax Indemnified Party and its affiliates
agree to cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in pursuing such contest,
including execution of any powers of attorney in favor of the
Tax Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party
informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim
and the Tax Indemnified Party, at its own cost and expense and with its own
counsel, shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the
applicable audit or examination and defense of such Tax Claim.   In no case
shall any Tax Indemnified Party settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim
without the Tax Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent. Neither party
shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Income Taxes of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries for a Straddle Period without the other party\'s
prior written consent.   SECTION 7.05. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, (i) except with
respect to breaches of Section 2.02 or Section 2.05 (as to which the
provisions of this subclause (i) shall not apply) neither Parent nor Seller
shall be responsible, pursuant to Section 7.02(i) or Section 7.02(ii), for
any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of a breach of
any of Parent\'s or Seller\'s representations or warranties or covenants to
be performed prior to Closing unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing
within one year after the Closing Date, failing which such claim shall be
waived and extinguished, (ii) except with respect to breaches of Section 2.02
or Section 2.05 (as to which the provisions of this subclause (ii) shall not
apply) neither Parent nor Seller shall be liable, pursuant to Section 7.02(i)
or Section 7.02(ii) for any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee
arising out of a breach of any of Parent\'s or Seller\'s representations or
warranties or covenants to be performed prior to Closing, in each case for
(x) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless the aggregate of
all Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds, on a cumulative
basis, an amount equal to $5,050,000, and then only to the extent of any such
excess or (y) any individual items where the Loss relating thereto is less
than $50,000 (and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the
immediately preceding clause (x)), (iii) except with respect to breaches
of       51   Section 2.02 or Section 2.05 (as to which the
provisions of this subclause (iii) shall not apply), the aggregate liability
of Parent and Seller hereunder pursuant to Section 7.02(i) and Section
7.02(ii) for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event
exceed $101,000,000, (iv) neither Parent nor Seller shall have any liability
pursuant to Section 7.02(i) in respect of any breach if Purchaser had
knowledge of such breach as of the date of this Agreement and (v) none of the
parties hereto shall be liable to any other for indirect, special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by such other party. In
no event shall Parent or Seller be obligated to indemnify Purchaser or any
other person with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was
reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the Closing Date Payment,
if any, pursuant to Section 1.07(c).   (b) Purchaser acknowledges that it,
its affiliates and its representatives and agents have received or been
afforded the opportunity to review prior to the date hereof all written
materials which Parent or the Seller were required to deliver or make
available, as the case may be, to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement on or
prior to the date hereof. Purchaser acknowledges that it, its affiliates and
its representatives and agents have been permitted full and complete access
to the Records, facilities, equipment, Tax Returns, Contracts, insurance
policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries that it, its affiliates and its representatives
have desired or requested to see and/or review, and that it, its affiliates
and its representatives and agents have had a full opportunity to meet with
the officers and employees of the Company to discuss the businesses and
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Purchaser further acknowledges
and agrees that, (i) other than the representations and warranties of Parent
and Seller specifically contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Seller or any other person has made any representation or warranty either
expressed or implied (A) with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries or
their respective assets and liabilities, the Excluded Assets, the Excluded
Liabilities, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Shares or (B) as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries furnished or made available to Purchaser, its affiliates, and
its agents and representatives and (ii) Purchaser shall have no claim
or right to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII and none of
Parent, Seller, the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other
person shall have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser or any other
person with respect to any information, documents or materials furnished by
Parent,       52   Seller, the Company or any of their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors to Purchaser, its affiliates and its agents and representatives,
including the Confidential Memorandum dated April, 2001 and any information,
documents or material made available to Purchaser in certain "data rooms",
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the trans
actions contemplated hereby.   (c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees
that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Company and its
subsidiaries or their respective assets and liabilities, the Excluded Assets,
the Excluded Liabilities, the transactions contemplated hereby and the Shares
(other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud)
Purchaser, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any other Purchaser
Indemnitee may have against Parent, Seller or any of their respective
affiliates arising under or based upon any Federal, state, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII).   SECTION
7.06. CALCULATION OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII shall be net of any
amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies with respect to such Loss and shall be (a) increased to take account
of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from
the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such indemnified amount. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or
Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any indemnified amount.   SECTION 7.07. TAX TREATMENT OF
INDEMNIFICATION. For all Tax Purposes, Purchaser and Seller agree to treat
any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price unless a final determination (which       53   shall include
the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form)
provides otherwise.   SECTION 7.08. AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO INCOME
TAXES. If as a result of an Income Tax audit that involves the Company or its
subsidiaries there is an adjustment to an item which results in the Purchaser
or Seller incurring a Tax detriment and the other party realizing a
corresponding Tax benefit, then the party receiving such Tax benefit will pay
to the other party the amount of such Tax benefit actually realized, but only
to the extent of such Tax detriment.    ARTICLE VIII   GENERAL
PROVISIONS   SECTION 8.01. ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights and obligations of the parties here under may be assigned

merger or consolidation shall not require the consent of the other parties
hereto. Notwith standing the foregoing, each of Parent, Seller and Purchaser
shall remain liable for all of their respective obligations under this
