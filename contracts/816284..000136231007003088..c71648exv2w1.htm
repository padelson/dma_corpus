January&nbsp;1, 2003, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has received written notice of any claim made by
any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where Parent or such Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns
that Parent or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There is no
outstanding agreement, waiver or consent providing for an extension of the statutory period of
limitations with respect to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any Subsidiary, and no
power of attorney granted by Parent or any Subsidiary with respect to any Tax matter is currently

that provides for the gross-up of a payment. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary is a party to a

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been or is required to make any material adjustment
pursuant to section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign tax law
by reason of any change in any accounting method, there is no application pending with any taxing
authority requesting permission for any change in any material accounting method for Tax purposes
and no taxing authority has proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law) or as a transferee or successor. There are no tax rulings, requests for
rulings or closing agreements relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could affect their
liability for material Taxes for any period after the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to include in the gross income of a taxable period ending after the
Closing Date material income or gain attributable to cash received, or an account receivable that
arose, in a prior taxable period and that was not recognized in that prior taxable period, as a

illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, prior to the Company obtaining Company Stockholder

(a)&nbsp;all capitalized terms used but not defined therein shall have the meanings assigned to them in
this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;the section numbers correspond to the section numbers in this Agreement and (c)
inclusion of any item in a disclosure letter (i)&nbsp;does not represent a determination that such item
is material or establish a standard of materiality, (ii)&nbsp;does not represent a determination that
