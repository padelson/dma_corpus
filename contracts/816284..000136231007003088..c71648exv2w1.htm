THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of
November 18, 2007, by and among Celgene Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Cobalt Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Pharmion
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth
in Article IX. 

  

RECITALS 

   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent deems it
advisable and in the best interests of each such corporation and its
stockholders that the Company and Parent engage in a business combination; 

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company and the
managers of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, the merger of the
Company with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of the
Company and the managers of Merger Sub have unanimously determined to
recommend to their respective stockholders and members the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in accordance with the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the " _DGCL_
") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (as amended, the " _LLCA_
"); 

  

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, Parent and the Company intend that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), and,
by approving resolutions authorizing this Agreement, to adopt this Agreement
as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the corresponding provisions of the Treasury Regulations; and 

  

WHEREAS, as a condition and further inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, certain
stockholders of the Company concurrently herewith are entering into a voting
agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each such stockholder has
irrevocably agreed to (i) vote in favor of adopting this Agreement and the
Merger and approving the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) grant in
favor of, and deliver to, Parent an irrevocable proxy relating to the
foregoing; 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and of other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby
agree as follows:

 _THE MERGER_  

   

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL
and the LLCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and
into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving
company after the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). 

  

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions as of
the Closing) set forth in Article VII, unless this Agreement has been
theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date and time of the Closing
being referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of Proskauer Rose LLP, 1585 Broadway, New York,
New York 10036, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State
of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the DGCL and the LLCA (the date and time of such
filing, or if a later date and time are specified in such filing, such
specified later date and time, being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the LLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company. 

   

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Company, except that the name of the Surviving
Company shall be Pharmion LLC, or such other name as Parent may specify,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the operating agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the operating agreement of
the Surviving Company, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be
Pharmion LLC, or such other name as Parent may specify, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.5 _Managers and Officers_. The managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial managers of the Surviving Company,
each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of formation and the
operating agreement of the Surviving Company. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
formation and the operating agreement of the Surviving Company. 

  

1.6 _Reverse Merger Event_. If the Continuity Percentage is less than 40%, for
all purposes in this Agreement, (i) the Merger shall be the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company, and as a result of such Merger, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company (not Merger Sub) shall be
the Surviving Company after the Merger, (ii) at the Effective Time, each
membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one shares of common stock, par
value $.001, of the Surviving Company, (iii) at the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company shall be the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Company, in each
case, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law, (iv) at the Effective Time, the managers of Merger Sub shall be the
directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company and (v)
all parties to this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.2(d) and 7.3(d). 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_  

   

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities: 

  

(a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.1(e) or
as to which appraisal rights are perfected pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) shall
be converted into the right to receive (i) that number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock
Portion_ ") equal to the quotient determined by dividing $47.00 by the
Measurement Price and rounding the result to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Measurement
Price is less than $56.15, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.8370 and if the
Measurement Price is greater than $72.93, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.6445
and (ii) $25.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Portion_ " and,
together with the Stock Portion, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

(b) _Parent-Owned Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled 

  

    ##### 

  

   

and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each membership interest of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as one
membership interest of the Surviving Company, which shall constitute the only
outstanding membership interest of the Surviving Company. 

  

(d) _Change in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split,
combination, contribution or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and
any adjustments or payments to be made under Section 2.4 and any other number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of Parent Common
Stock, including the Measurement Price, or the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be
correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Options and other awards under the Company Equity Plans, the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; provided that with respect to outstanding Company Options and other
awards made under the Company Equity Plans, any such adjustments shall be
made only to the extent required under the applicable Company Equity Plan. 

  

(e) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held in the Company treasury and each share of Company Common Stock, if any,
owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof. 

  

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded appraisal for such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL, shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses such stockholders right to appraisal. If after the
Effective Time such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such
stockholders right to appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or
offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the
prior written consent of Parent. 

   

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and/or the
Surviving Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
American Stock Transfer 

  

    ##### 

  

  

and Trust Company or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, vested Company
Options and other vested Company equity awards, for exchange, in accordance
with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration, including sufficient certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and amounts payable to
holders of Company Options vested pursuant to Section 2.4(a) and holders of
the Company equity awards vested pursuant to Section 2.4(b) (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in respect of shares of Company Common Stock, vested
Company Options and other vested Company equity awards for which
Certificates, if any, have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders
of the Company or holders of vested Company Options or other vested Company
equity awards 180 days after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent
and such security holders shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event no more than three
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than a Certificate representing
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon. 

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock, with a record date after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, unless and
until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Certificate. Subject to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to such holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date at or after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. 

  

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
and paid upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common
Stock. 

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
upon surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall
receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Measurement
Price. Such payment shall occur as soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to each holder of
Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional shares and following
compliance by such holder with the exchange procedures set forth in Section
2.2(b) and in the letter of transmittal. No dividend or distribution with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to
any fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. 

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options or other Company equity awards for the Merger Consideration from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other applicable Law. 

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon. 

  

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Option such amounts as 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock or Company Option in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent. 

  

2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective
Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for
any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon. 

   

2.4 _Company Options and Other Equity Awards_. 

  

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option,
shall be converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest number of
whole shares) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the
Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Option
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that such conversion shall in all
events occur in a manner satisfying the requirements of Sections 409A, 422 and
424 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall be the fraction having a
numerator equal to the per share Merger Consideration (valuing the Stock
Portion of the Merger Consideration at the Measurement Price thereof) and
having a denominator equal to the Measurement Price. Except as specifically
provided in this Section 2.4(a), following the Effective Time, each Company
Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as set
forth in the applicable Company Equity Plan and any agreements thereunder as
were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall assume the Company Equity Plans, and the number and
kind of shares available for issuance under the Company Equity Plans shall be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of each applicable Company Equity Plan. At the Effective Time,
each vested Company Option shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, from Parent, the
consideration, subject to all applicable income and employment withholding
taxes, such holder would have received if such holder had effected a cashless
exercise of such vested Company 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the shares of Company
Common Stock issued upon such cashless exercise were converted in the Merger
into Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Such cashless exercise
shall be deemed to have been effected by distributing to the holder of each
vested Company Option a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each vested Company
Option, less the number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value to
the sum of the aggregate exercise price of each vested Company Option plus
the aggregate income and employment withholding taxes payable as a result of
the deemed exercise of each vested Company Option (measured based on the
extent to which the aggregate fair market value of the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable under each vested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time exceeds the aggregate exercise price of each
vested Company Option). The net number of shares of Company Common
Stock deemed issued in connection with the deemed cashless exercise of each
vested Company Option shall be converted on the Effective Time into the
Merger Consideration. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company
Option informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company
Options. 

  

(b) _Other Company Equity Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
any then outstanding restricted shares of Company Common Stock or restricted
share units held under the Company Equity Plans shall become fully vested,
subject to applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. All shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the
restricted shares of Company Common Stock or the full vesting and payment of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of outstanding restricted share
units shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. 

  

(c) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Companys 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _Company ESPP_ ")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may be required to provide that, with respect to the Company ESPP:
(i) each individual participating in the Offering (as defined in the Company
ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Final Offering_ ")
shall not be permitted (A) to increase the amount of his or her rate of
payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect when the Final
Offering commenced, or (B) to make separate non-payroll contributions to the
Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual
who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement
may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement; (iii) the Final Offering shall end on the earlier to occur of
January 31, 2008 and a date that is five days prior to the Effective Time;
(iv) each Company ESPP participants accumulated contributions under the
Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as of the end of the Final
Offering; and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately following the
end of the Final Offering and no further rights shall be granted or exercised
under the Company ESPP thereafter. All shares of Company Common Stock
purchased in the Final Offering shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Reservation of Shares; Registration_. Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. 

  

(e) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
any and all actions necessary, including obtaining necessary consents and/or
amending and/or interpreting any provisions of the Company Equity Plans or
agreements governing the terms and conditions of the Company Options
to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4 (including approval of the
Board of Directors of the Company or an authorized committee thereof). 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_  

   

Except as set forth on the disclosure letter delivered to Parent and Merger
Sub by the Company on or prior to the date of the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except as disclosed in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the
" _Company Form 10-K_"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Current
Reports on Form 8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC from the date of the
filing of the Company Form 10-K to the date of this Agreement (other than
disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" sections of
such reports and except as expressly provided in Section 3.6 of the Company
Disclosure Letter), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that: 

  

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware,
and the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and
operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted. The
Company is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which
its ownership of property or the conduct of its businesses as now conducted
requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified as a
foreign corporation would not have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent a
complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, each as amended to date, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.
The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws. The Subsidiaries of the Company are not in
violation, in any material respect, of any of the provisions of
their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents). 

  

3.2 _Subsidiaries_. Except as set forth on Section 3.2 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or
holds the right to acquire any stock, partnership interest, joint venture
interest or other equity ownership interest in any other Person. There are no
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make
any loan to, or any investment (in the form of a capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person. Each Subsidiary of the Company
is either wholly owned by the Company or a Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company as indicated on Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Each
outstanding share of capital stock of or other equity interest in each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is owned by the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary,
free and clear of any Liens, except Permitted Liens. Each of the Subsidiaries
which should be identified on Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent the
concept of good standing is applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own its properties and to carry on its businesses as now
conducted and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which its
ownership of property or the conduct of its businesses as now conducted
requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be qualified as a foreign
corporation would not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and the authorized
and outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company. 

  

3.3 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate, on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority (assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.21) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on the record date for the
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). All corporate
action on the part of the Company, its officers, directors and stockholders
necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the performance of all obligations of the Company hereunder has been taken,
subject only to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
and general principles of equity affecting the availability of specific
performance and other equitable remedies. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.4, has
unanimously resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

Material Adverse Effect, require any consent under any Company Contract, (ii)

or use.

Subsidiaries or preemptive rights with respect thereto. 

   

3.6 _Company SEC Reports_. 

  

(a) The Company has filed with or otherwise furnished to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") all material forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since December 31, 2003 (such
documents, as supplemented or amended since the time of filing, and together
with all information incorporated by reference therein, the " _Company
SEC Reports_ "). No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file with or
furnish to the SEC any such forms, reports, schedules, statements or other
documents. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports, including
any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, at the time filed (or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment)
(i) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Reports, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. 

  

(b) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that has been
designed to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

(c) The Company maintains a system of "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) necessary in
order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the
Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The Companys
"disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such 

  

    ##### 

  

   

information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. 

  

(d) Since December 31, 2003, the Company has not received any oral or written
notification of a (x) "reportable condition" or (y) "material weakness" in

"reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on
the date hereof. 

  

(e) The Company has provided to Parent copies of all correspondence sent to or
received from the SEC by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
counsel or accountants since December 31, 2003. As of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from
the SEC staff with respect to Company SEC Reports. 

  

(f) The audited consolidated financial statements included in the Companys
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the Companys
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007
(including any related notes and schedules) and the other financial statements
included in the Company SEC Reports fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods set forth
therein, and in each case were prepared in conformity with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise disclosed in the
notes thereto and subject, in the case of financial statements for quarterly
periods, to normal year-end adjustments not material in amount). The books of
account and other financial records of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries are true and complete in all material respects and reflect
only actual transactions. 

  

(g) There is no liability or obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined or
determinable) other than: (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or
provided for in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
September 30, 2007 or disclosed in the notes thereto (the " _Company Current
Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred after September
30, 2007 in the ordinary course of the Companys business; (iii) liabilities
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or disclosed on Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter;
(iv) liabilities under any agreement, lease, note, mortgage, indenture or
other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which is not in
violation of the terms of this Agreement; and (v) other liabilities or
obligations which would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30, 2007 and prior
to the date of this Agreement, the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice. Since September 30, 2007, (a) there has
not been any Company Material Adverse Effect and (b) none of the Company 

  

    ##### 

  

   

or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date
of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set
forth in Section 5.1. 

   

3.8 _Title to Properties_. 

  

(a) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns good and marketable title to,
or holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases, all of the material
personal property shown to be owned by them on the Company Current Balance
Sheet, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens or other
imperfections of title, if any, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
material personal property shown to be owned by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Company Current Balance Sheet have been maintained in
accordance with the Companys and its Subsidiaries normal practices and are
in usable condition for the operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
businesses, ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, or ever has owned,
any real property. 

  

(c) The real property demised by the leases described on Section 3.8(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Company Leased Real Property_ ")
constitutes all of the real property leased by the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Section 3.8(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company Leased Real Property leases are in full force and effect,
subject to proper authorization and execution of such lease by the other
party and the application of any bankruptcy or creditors rights Laws or
general principles of equity. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is in default in any material respect under any of
such leases. 

  

3.9 _Tax Matters_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all material
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by them (taking into account any
extensions of time to file that have been duly perfected). All such Tax
Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed.
All material Taxes have been fully paid or properly accrued. The
provision for Taxes on the Company Current Balance Sheet is sufficient in all
material respects for all accrued and unpaid Taxes as of the date thereof and
all material Taxes which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is
obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third
party have been fully paid or properly accrued. There are no Liens with
respect to any Taxes upon any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries assets,
other than (i) Taxes, the payment of which is not yet due, or (ii) Taxes or
charges being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all Laws,
rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes, and
are not liable for any such Taxes in a material amount or for failure to
comply with such Laws, rules and regulations. There are no audits, claims,
assessments, levies, administrative or judicial Proceedings pending against
the Company or any Subsidiary by any tax authority. Since January 1, 2003,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received written notice of any
claim made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or
such Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There is no
outstanding agreement, waiver or consent providing for an extension of the
statutory period of limitations with respect to any material Taxes or Tax
Returns 

  

    ##### 

  

   

of the Company or any Subsidiary, and no power of attorney granted by the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any material Tax matter is
currently in force. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to or
is otherwise bound by any agreement providing for the allocation or sharing
of Taxes or has any obligation or liability under any such agreement to which
it was once a party or otherwise bound, other than any obligation arising
under a loan or credit agreement or under any contract entered into in the
ordinary course of business that provides for the gross-up of a payment.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to a "reportable
transaction" as defined in Section 6011 of the Code or the regulations
thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been or is
required to make any material adjustment pursuant to section 481(a) of the
Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign tax law by reason of
any change in any accounting method, there is no application pending with any
taxing authority requesting permission for any change in any material
accounting method for Tax purposes and no taxing authority has proposed any
such adjustment or change in accounting method. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) or as a transferee or
successor. There are no tax rulings, requests for rulings or closing
agreements relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could
affect their liability for material Taxes for any period after the Closing
Date. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in the gross income of a taxable period ending after the Closing Date
material income or gain attributable to cash received, or an account
receivable that arose, in a prior taxable period and that was not recognized
in that prior taxable period, as a result of the installment method, the
completed contract method or the cash method of accounting or any other
method of accounting or section 263A of the Code. All copies of federal and
state income or franchise Tax Returns that the Company has made available to
Parent are true and complete copies. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, or is aware of any fact
or circumstance, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
Company is not, nor was it or will it be, at any time during the five-year
period ending on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, a "United
States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of section 897(c)
of the Code.

of equity. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor to the Companys
knowledge is any other party, in breach, default or violation (and no event
has occurred or not occurred through the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries action or inaction or, to the Companys knowledge, through the
action or inaction of any third party, that with notice or the lapse of time
or both would constitute a breach, default or violation) of any term,
condition or provision of any Company Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is now a party, or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except for breaches, defaults
or violations that would not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) To the Companys knowledge, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns,
or is licensed or otherwise possesses sufficient legally enforceable rights
to use all Company Intellectual Property Rights, free and clear of all Liens,
except for any such failures to own, be licensed, possess or enforce that,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the Companys knowledge, (A) neither the use of any Company Intellectual
Property Rights by the Company or its Subsidiaries nor the conduct of the
business of the Company or its Subsidiaries conflicts with, infringes upon,
violates or interferes with, or constitutes an appropriation of any right,
title, interest or goodwill, including any valid patent, trademark, trade
name, service mark or copyright or other intellectual property right of any
other Person and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of any claim by third parties or otherwise has
knowledge that any Company Intellectual Property Right is invalid or
unenforceable, except where the failure to be valid or enforceable would not,

Effect. 

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
to the Companys knowledge, no Person materially conflicts with, infringes
upon, violates or interferes with, or otherwise misappropriates any material

Subsidiaries, and there is no such Proceeding threatened or pending by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not result in the loss or impairment of any Company Intellectual Property
Right or payment of any additional amounts with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property Right, except, in each case, as would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
require the consent of any other Person in respect of any material
Company Intellectual Property Right. 

  

3.12 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there is no action, suit, hearing, claim, investigation,

4.6 _Parent SEC Reports_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(a) Parent has filed with or otherwise furnished to the SEC all material
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since
December 31, 2003 (such documents, as supplemented or amended since the time
of filing, and together with all information incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). No Subsidiary of Parent is
required to file with or furnish to the SEC any such forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents. As of their respective dates, the
Parent SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed (or, if

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and (ii) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. 

  

(b) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that has been designed to
provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

(c) Parent maintains a system of "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) necessary in
order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent
to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act
and the rules promulgated thereunder. Parents "disclosure controls and
procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. 

  

(d) Since December 31, 2003, Parent has not received any oral or written
notification of a (x) "reportable condition" or (y) "material weakness" in

condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

(e) Parent has provided to the Company copies of all correspondence sent to or
received from the SEC by Parent or its Subsidiaries or their respective
counsel or accountants since December 31, 2003. As of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from
the SEC staff with respect to the Parent SEC Reports. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) The audited consolidated financial statements included in the Parent Form
10-K and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in
Parents quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2007 (including any related notes and schedules) and the other financial
statements included in Parent SEC Reports fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods set forth
therein, and in each case were prepared in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise
disclosed in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of financial
statements for quarterly periods, to normal year-end adjustments not material
in amount). The books of account and other financial records of Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries are true and complete in all material respects and
reflect only actual transactions. 

  

(g) There are no liabilities or obligations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined or
determinable) other than: (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or
provided for in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
September 30, 2007 or disclosed in the notes thereto (the " _Parent Current
Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred after September
30, 2007 in the ordinary course of Parents business that are not
individually or in the aggregate material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) liabilities under any
agreement, lease, note, mortgage, indenture or other obligation of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, which is not in violation of the terms of this
Agreement; and (v) other liabilities or obligations which would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30, 2007 and prior
to the date of this Agreement, the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice. Since September 30, 2007, (a) there has not been any
Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
Section 5.3. 

  

4.8 _Title to Properties_. Parent or one of its Subsidiaries owns good and
marketable title to, or holds pursuant to valid and enforceable leases, all
of the material personal property shown to be owned by them on the Parent
Current Balance Sheet, free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
Liens or other imperfections of title, if any, that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. All material personal property shown to be owned by Parent
and its Subsidiaries on the Parent Current Balance Sheet have been maintained
in accordance with Parents and its Subsidiaries normal practices and are in
usable condition for the operation of Parents and its Subsidiaries
businesses, ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

  

4.9 _Tax Matters_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed all material Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by them (taking into account any
extensions of time to file that have been duly perfected). All such Tax
Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed.
All material Taxes have been fully paid or properly accrued. The provision for
Taxes on the Parent Current Balance Sheet is sufficient in all material
respects for all accrued 

  

    ##### 

  

   

and unpaid Taxes as of the date thereof and all material Taxes which Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any
employee, creditor or third party have been fully paid or properly accrued.
There are no Liens with respect to any Taxes upon any of Parents or its
Subsidiaries assets, other than (i) Taxes, the payment of which is not yet
due, or (ii) Taxes or charges being contested in good faith by appropriate
Proceedings. Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes, and are not liable for any such Taxes in a material
amount or for failure to comply with such Laws, rules and regulations. Except
as set forth on Section 4.9 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no
audits, claims, assessments, levies, administrative or judicial Proceedings
pending against Parent or any Subsidiary by any tax authority. Since January
1, 2003, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has received written notice of any
claim made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where Parent or such
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that Parent or such Subsidiary is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There is no outstanding
agreement, waiver or consent providing for an extension of the statutory
period of limitations with respect to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of
Parent or any Subsidiary, and no power of attorney granted by Parent or any
Subsidiary with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force. Neither
Parent nor any Subsidiary is a party to or is otherwise bound by any
agreement providing for the allocation or sharing of Taxes or has any
obligation or liability under any such agreement to which it was once a party
or otherwise bound, other than any obligation arising under a loan or credit
agreement or under any contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business that provides for the gross-up of a payment. Neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary is a party to a "reportable transaction" as defined in Section
6011 of the Code or the regulations thereunder. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been or is required to make any material adjustment pursuant
to section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign tax law by reason of any change in any accounting method, there is no
application pending with any taxing authority requesting permission for any
change in any material accounting method for Tax purposes and no taxing
authority has proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any
person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations
section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) or
as a transferee or successor. There are no tax rulings, requests for rulings
or closing agreements relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could
affect their liability for material Taxes for any period after the Closing
Date. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
in the gross income of a taxable period ending after the Closing Date
material income or gain attributable to cash received, or an account
receivable that arose, in a prior taxable period and that was not recognized
in that prior taxable period, as a result of the installment method, the
completed contract method or the cash method of accounting or any other
method of accounting or section 263A of the Code. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, or is aware of any
fact or circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

4.10 _Material Contracts_. 

  

(a) All agreements, contracts and understandings that are required to be
described in the Parent SEC Reports or required to be filed as exhibits
thereto (the " _Parent Contracts_ ") have been described or filed as
required. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each of the Parent Contracts is a valid and binding obligation of Parent
(or the Subsidiaries of Parent party thereto), and to Parents knowledge, the
other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and its Subsidiaries and,
to Parents knowledge, the other parties thereto in accordance with its
terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, arrangement or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity. 

  

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor to Parents knowledge
is any other party, in breach, default or violation (and no event has
occurred or not occurred through Parents or any of its Subsidiaries action
or inaction or, to Parents knowledge, through the action or inaction of any
third party, that with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute
a breach, default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of any
Parent Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party, or
by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except for breaches, defaults or violations that would not have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

4.11 _Intellectual Property_. 

  

(a) To Parents knowledge, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is the sole and
exclusive beneficial and record owner of all material Parent Intellectual

the foregoing or the Companys failure to transmit to the Companys
stockholders, within 10 Business Days after the commencement of any tender
or exchange offer for 30% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock by a Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent, a statement that the
Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to make
such Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least three Business Days
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising that
the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and

related disclosure to the Companys stockholders or (ii) any material
facts, including the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been submitted to
the Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to make
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall, except as specifically permitted by Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.4,
withdraw, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, amend or modify,
its position with respect to the Merger or this Agreement or approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an Alternative Transaction.

(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to provide Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice access to the offices, employees, customers,
suppliers, properties, books and records of the Company (so long as such

of the parties shall comply with, and shall cause each of its Representatives

participate in or knowingly encourage any discussion or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
knowingly facilitate or take any other action with respect to any inquiry or
any proposal that constitutes or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Alternative Transaction or Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the Company may furnish information to, and enter into discussions
or negotiations with, any Person that makes an Acquisition Proposal that is
unsolicited and does not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.4,
if (i) prior to taking such action, the Company shall have received from such
Person an executed agreement relating to the confidentiality of information
to be provided to such Person, which confidentiality agreement shall be no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and all information provided to such Person, if
not previously provided to Parent, shall be promptly provided or made
available to Parent, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal and (after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. The Company shall
provide prompt (but in any event by the following day) written notice to
Parent of (y) the receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal and
any modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal and (z) the identity
of the party making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including a copy thereof), and the
Company shall continue to keep Parent reasonably informed on as prompt
a basis as reasonably practicable of the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal. If any such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event by the following day) provide
written notice thereof to Parent. For a period of not less than three
Business Days after receipt by Parent from the Company of such notice, the
Company shall, if requested in writing by Parent, negotiate in good faith
with Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company would be able to proceed with the Company
Recommendation to its stockholders without making a Change of Recommendation.
The Company shall cease and cause to be terminated immediately all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously provided. 

  

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party will (and will cause its Affiliates to) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file,
or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining all necessary consents,
waivers, approvals, authorizations, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Permits or orders from all Governmental Entities or other Persons, including
responding to additional inquiries or requests for additional information
from any Governmental Entity;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be obligated to sell, transfer or
otherwise divest any of its or any of its Subsidiaries assets, properties or
businesses (including assets, properties or businesses which were assets,
properties or businesses of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof prior to
the Effective Time) or enter into any agreements providing for any such sale,
transfer or other divesture or restricting or limiting in any way or to any
extent the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from engaging in
any business anywhere in the world. Each party shall also (and will cause its
Affiliates to) refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
(including making acquisitions), that would be reasonably likely to result in
a failure of any of the conditions to the Merger in this Agreement being
satisfied or restrict or materially delay such partys ability to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall agree, if requested by Parent, to take or commit to take any
action with respect to the business, properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in furtherance of this Section 6.5; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. 

   

6.6 _Regulatory Filings_. 

  

(a) Without limiting the generality of the obligations of the parties pursuant
to Section 6.5 and subject to the proviso in Section 6.5, Parent shall
determine whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity by any party hereto or any Subsidiary thereof is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are reasonably
required to be obtained from any parties to any material contract, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the parties hereto will cooperate with each other in
seeking and obtaining any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or
making any such filings and furnishing information required in connection
therewith, provided, that neither party shall make an antitrust or
competition filing with a Governmental Entity other than under the HSR Act and
in respect of the Foreign Filings unless the parties hereto mutually agree
that such filing is necessary or Parent determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that such filing is required pursuant
to Law in connection with the Merger. To the extent reasonably practicable,
the parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance
and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the information
relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent promptly shall notify and
provide a copy to the other party of any written communication received from
any Governmental Entity with respect to any filing or submission or with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other
reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filing or any such transaction. To the extent reasonably
practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit
their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting
or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, without giving the opportunity of the other party
to attend or participate. To the extent permitted by 

  

    ##### 

  

   

applicable Law, the parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with
one another in connection with any analyses, appearance, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection with Proceedings under
or related to the HSR Act or other applicable Law. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, except as otherwise expressly provided above in this
Section 6.6(a), the determination of Parent shall prevail in the event of a
disagreement on any matter contemplated by this Section 6.6(a). 

  

(b) The parties (i) shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and state securities or applicable Blue Sky
Laws in connection with the Merger and (ii) promptly shall prepare and file
all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and use all reasonable best efforts, subject to
Section 6.5, to obtain all necessary consents from any Governmental Entities
necessary to consummate the Merger. The Company and Parent shall promptly
provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such filings
that include confidential information not directly related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(c) Subject to the proviso in Section 6.5, Parent and the Company hereby
further agree to the prompt use of their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or
issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any
Proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps
necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or
remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

6.7 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
the other party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the failure of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of the other party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. 

  

6.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with and
obtain the approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) before 

  

    ##### 

  

   

issuing any press release or other public announcement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release prior to
such consultation and approval, except as may be required by applicable Law
or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares of either party
on any securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such
press release or making any such public announcement; _provided_ , _however_
, that each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in
response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls,
so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the
other party. 

   

6.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and each of Parent and Surviving Company shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including any
person who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

  

(b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to maintain in effect for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer with the same
or better credit rating as the current carrier for the Company that provides
coverage for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such person covered by the officers
and directors liability insurance policy of the Company on terms with
respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving
Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if any annual premium for
such insurance coverage exceeds 200% of such annual premium, Parent shall
obtain a policy the Surviving Company believes has the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent may satisfy
its obligations under this Section 6.9(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy from
an insurer with the same or better credit rating as the current carrier for
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy, which (i)
has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each
person covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement or at the Effective Time for actions and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, 

  

    ##### 

  

   

and (iii) contains terms that are no less favorable than those of the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement. 

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to cause to be maintained in
effect in the Surviving Companys (or any successors) certificate of
formation and operating agreement provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the
intended beneficiaries as those contained in the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of the Surviving Company under this Section 6.9 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party without the express written consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.9). 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.9(i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in
this Section 6.9. 

   

6.10 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

(a) For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the December
31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by
Parent or its Affiliates following the Effective Time (the "
_Company Employees_ "), compensation and employee benefits (other than equity
compensation) that are comparable in the aggregate to the greater of: (i)
those provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) those provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. The preceding sentence shall
not preclude Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective
Time from terminating the employment of any Company Employee for any reason
(or no reason). 

  

(b) Each Company Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any
Parent Plan, including any such plans providing vacation, sick pay, severance
and retirement benefits maintained by Parent in which such Company Employees
participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to
benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not
for accrual of pension benefits), to the extent past service was recognized
for such Company Employees under the comparable Company Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and to the same extent past service is credited
under such plans or arrangements for similarly situated 

  

    ##### 

  

   

employees of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
6.10(b) shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result
in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii) service credit for benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan, or (iii) service credit under a newly
established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally. 

  

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (i) the waiver of
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Company Employees under any such welfare benefit plans to the extent that
such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence
of such change, and (ii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs, the crediting of each Company Employee with any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change. 

  

(d) Subject to the review and written approval of Parent (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld), the Company shall be permitted to adopt a
retention plan within 30 Business Days following the date of this Agreement
consistent with the terms and conditions set forth on Section 6.10(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.10 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Parent Plan, or shall limit the right
of Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent Plan following
the Effective Time. If (i) a party other than the parties hereto makes a claim
or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to any Parent Plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an
amendment to such Parent Plan even though not explicitly designated as such
in this Agreement, then, solely with respect to such Parent Plan, such
provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect with
respect thereto. 

  

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.10 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person,
including any employees or former employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, any participant in any Parent Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of
its Affiliates. 

  

6.11 _WARN Act_. With respect to all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries shall be responsible
for providing any notices required to be given and otherwise complying with
the WARN Act or similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating
to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event) caused
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall have no
responsibility or liability under the WARN Act (or any other similar statute
or regulation or region/country /European Union directive) with respect to
such employees. Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true
and complete list of the names and the sites of employment or facilities of
those individuals who suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN
Act 

  

    ##### 

  

   

or as defined by international/country/European Union directives) at any site
of employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during
the 90-day period prior to the date of this Agreement. Section 6.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be updated immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to the 90-day period prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company agrees to provide any notice required under
the WARN Act to any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing. 

  

6.12 _Company 401(k) Plans_. If requested by Parent at least 15 days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that include a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of
the Code, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. If Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company
(the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) not
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors
of the Company or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC
so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of Parent or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that
the acquisition by any officer or director of the Company or Parent who is a
covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of shares of
Parent Common Stock or options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act. 

  

6.14 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at the other partys expense, any other party shall execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with the other in the defense or settlement of any litigation against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, but no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Parent and the Company, which consent shall not be
withheld unreasonably. 

  

6.16 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the Companys stockholders in the
Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise of Company Options 

  

    ##### 

  

   

to be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

6.17 _Affiliate Letters_. The Company shall, promptly after the date hereof,
deliver to Parent a list setting forth the names of all stockholders of the
Company that the Company expects to be deemed "affiliates" (as defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of
the Company at the time of the Stockholders Meeting. The Company
shall subsequently, up to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, supplement
such list from time to time as appropriate. The Company shall furnish such
information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the list as it may be supplemented. If Rule 145 under
the Securities Act, as in effect at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy/Prospectus, would restrict or limit the ability of such stockholders to
sell freely the shares of Parent Common Stock that they will receive in the
Merger, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each person
who is identified as such an affiliate in the list furnished or supplemented
pursuant to this Section 6.17 to execute a written agreement in substantially
the form of Exhibit B hereto. 

   

6.18 _Tax Matters_. 

  

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and will report it as such for federal,
state and local income tax purposes. None of the parties will knowingly take
any action or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. 

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide the officers certificates and to obtain the opinions referred to in
Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3(d), respectively (subject to the waivers
referred to in Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3(d). 

  

(c) The parties agree that Merger Sub shall be treated as a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and agree not to take any action that
would be inconsistent with such treatment. 

  

6.19 _Required Registration; Additional Obligations of Parent_. As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-3 or, if unavailable, such other
comparable form that Parent is eligible to use (the " _Resale Registration
Statement_ "), covering the resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock held
by those stockholders of the Company who may be deemed to be "affiliates" (as
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act) of the Company at the time of the Stockholders Meeting.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective prior to or at the Effective Time
and to remain effective until the earlier to occur of (a) the second
anniversary of the Effective Time, (b) the date on which all persons who may
be deemed to be affiliates of the Company under Rule 145 no longer own any
shares of Parent Common Stock covered by such registration statement and
(c) 

  

    ##### 

  

   

the date that all such shares of Parent Common Stock covered by such
registration statement may be sold freely without volume or other
limitations.
