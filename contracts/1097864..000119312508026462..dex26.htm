6.1(d)_ and  _Section 6.1(e)_ in respect of the matters described in (i)
_Schedule 1.2(c)(i)_ , and (ii) _Schedule 1.2(c)(ii)_ hereof. The Escrow Fund

any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The escrow agent under the
Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall be a financial institution

be administered in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Buyers with access to the Books and Records of the Sellers as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyers in order to confirm the WIP Adjustment
Amount and the amount of the Non-U.S. Vacation Liability. The
Sellers covenant and agree that the WIP Adjustment Amount and the Non-U.S.
Vacation Liability shall be calculated in a manner consistent in all respects
with the manner in which the WIP calculations previously provided to SCI have
been calculated and the manner in which the Non-U.S. Vacation Liability is

5 ARTICLE II

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

Parent represents and warrants to the Buyers that the statements contained in
this Article II are true and correct, except as set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and
subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Article II. The disclosures in any section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other sections and
subsections in this Article II to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a
reading of the disclosure in any such section or subsection that such
disclosure is applicable to such other sections and subsections. The inclusion
of any information in the Disclosure Schedule (or any update thereto) shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that
such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material
to the Business, has resulted in or would result in a Business Material
Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business. For purposes
of this Agreement, the phrase "to the knowledge of the Sellers" or any phrase
of similar import shall mean and be limited to the actual knowledge, after due
inquiry of their respective direct reports, of the following individuals: John
Blake, Peter Henry, Bill Martin and Margaret Seif.

2.1 _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power_. Each of the Sellers is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and is
duly qualified to conduct business under the laws of each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its activities as they relate exclusively to the Business, makes such
qualification necessary, except for any such failure to be qualified that
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse
Effect. Each Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on the business in which it is now engaged and to own and use the properties
now owned and used by it.

2.2 _Authority_. Each Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
it will be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder.
The execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement and such Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation by each Seller of the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each Seller. This
Agreement has been, and such Ancillary Agreements will be, validly executed
and delivered by each Seller and, assuming this Agreement and each such
Ancillary Agreement constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Buyers,
constitutes or will constitute a valid and binding obligation of each Seller,
enforceable against each Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those
limiting the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies and those providing for equitable defenses.

2.3 _Noncontravention_. Subject to compliance with the applicable requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and applicable foreign antitrust or trade
regulation laws, neither the execution and delivery by any Seller of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which  



 

6  such Seller will be a party, nor the consummation by any Seller of the
Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will: 

(a) conflict with or violate any provision of the charter or bylaws of such
Seller;

(b) require on the part of any Seller any filing with, or any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity, except for
any filing, permit, authorization, consent or approval which if not obtained
or made would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material
Adverse Effect;

(c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the acceleration
of obligations under, create in any party the right to terminate or modify, or
require any notice, consent or waiver under, any contract, lease, sublease,
license, sublicense, franchise, permit, indenture, agreement or mortgage
for borrowed money, instrument of indebtedness or Lien to which any Seller is
a party or by which any Seller is bound or to which any of its respective
assets is subject, except for (i) any conflict, breach, default, acceleration
or right to terminate or modify that would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Business Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any notice, consent or
waiver the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Business Material Adverse Effect; or

(d) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree specifically naming, or
statute, rule or regulation applicable to, any Seller or any of or their
respective properties or assets, except for any violation that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect.

2.4 _Financial Statements; Taxes_.

(a) The income statements for the Business for the fiscal years ended October
30, 2004, October 29, 2005 and October 28, 2006, and for the fiscal quarters
ended February 3, 2007, May 5, 2007 and August 4, 2007 are attached as
_Section 2.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Such income statements were
prepared by management of the Business and are consistent with the books and
records of the Sellers as they relate to the Business; _provided_ _however_ ,
that such income statements are based on the combined revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities of Sellers relevant to the Business. Such income
statements were not necessarily prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, including with respect to the allocation or
estimation of costs, operating expenses, assets and liabilities that were
included in the Business.

(b) All Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Business
have been timely filed, and all such Tax Returns are complete and correct in
all material respects. All Taxes due and payable with respect to the Business,
whether or not shown on such Tax Returns, have been paid in full. There is no
action pending with respect to any Tax with respect to the Business
which could reasonably be expected to result in a Lien on the Acquired
Assets.

2.5 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since August 4, 2007, there have not been
any changes in the financial condition or results of operations of the
Business, except for any changes  



 

7  that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material
Adverse Effect. Since August 4, 2007, each Seller has conducted the Business

(i) any combination of the Products by or for a Buyer with any existing or

Rights, including, without limitation, any employee or contractor that have
not been either assigned to a Seller or exclusively licensed to a Seller on a

material Trade Secrets included in the Transferred Intellectual Property

13  list of all Employees who are a party to a non-competition agreement with
any Seller; copies of such agreements have previously been delivered to SCI.

2002, any material strikes, slowdowns, grievances, claims of unfair labor
practices or other collective bargaining disputes with respect to the
Business, nor to the knowledge of the Sellers, are any such actions, claims
or disputes threatened.

(c) Each Seller is in material compliance with all Applicable Laws pertaining
to the Sellers employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and
wages and hours (including, but not limited to, proper classification of
employees for ERISA purposes and as exempt or non-exempt, proper
characterization of service providers as consultants and independent
contractors, immigration related obligations with respect to each Employee and
the withholding, remittance and reporting of applicable Taxes on wages). There
are no claims of any nature pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened by any Employee or former Employee of each Seller against such
Seller in connection with the Sellers employment (or termination thereof) of
such Employee or former Employee.

(d) There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined by the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended, in respect of

Disclosure Schedule lists all Employees whose employment has been
involuntarily terminated or who have received notice of involuntary
termination of their employment during the six-month period prior to the date
of this Agreement.

2.12 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Section 2.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all Business Benefit Plans. Correct and complete copies have
been delivered or made available to SCI by the Parent of all Business Benefit
Plans (including all amendments and attachments thereto); the most recent
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (if applicable); and
the most recent summary plan descriptions for the Business Benefit Plans (if
applicable).

(b) The Business Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Business Benefit Plans are
qualified and the plans and the trusts related thereto are exempt from
federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the
Code, and each such determination letter covers all tax-qualification
provisions that are required to be stated in the applicable plan as of the
date of this Agreement (or such plan is within the applicable remedial
amendment period for making any required changes). To the knowledge of the
Sellers, no event has occurred and no circumstance exists that will or
could give rise to the disqualification of any such Business Benefit Plan or
the loss of tax exemption for the trust thereunder.



 

14 (c) Each Business Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded, and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law. All
contributions required to be made to any Business Benefit Plan have been made
or a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to and funding
obligations of each Business Benefit Plan. No violation of or failure to
comply with Applicable Law exists with respect to any Business Benefit Plan
maintained by any Seller, any of their respective Affiliates or any ERISA
Affiliate that could subject any Buyer to any fine, penalty, Tax or liability
of any kind imposed under ERISA or the Code, and no Employment Liabilities of
any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate could become a liability of any Buyer,
except as specifically provided in this Agreement or in  _Section 2.12(c)_
of the Disclosure Schedule.

there are no unfunded obligations under any Business Benefit Plan providing

coverage required to be continued under Section 4980B of the Code or other
similar applicable laws.

(e) Except as set forth in  _Section 2.12(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
there are no pending investigations, claims or lawsuits which have been
asserted or instituted by or against any Business Benefit Plan, against the
assets of any of the trusts under such plans or by or against the plan
sponsor, plan administrator, or any fiduciary of any Business Benefit Plan
with respect to the operation or administration of such plans (other than
routine benefit claims) nor do the Sellers have knowledge of facts that could
form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.

(f) Neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to, or has any
liability with respect to a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. No
Business Benefit Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as
described in Code Section 409A) which would subject any Person to tax
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code based upon a good faith interpretation of
all applicable regulations, notices and regulatory guidance.

(g) Except as specifically disclosed in _Section 2.12(g)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation or benefits
due to, or in respect of, any Employee.

(h) Except as specifically disclosed in  _Section 2.12(h)_ of the Disclosure

or (ii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former
Employee (or his or her beneficiary).

(i) Each Business Benefit Plan which provides medical, dental, health or long-
term disability benefits is fully insured by a third party insurer and claims
with respect to  



 

15  any participant or covered dependent under such Business Benefit Plan could
not result in uninsured liability to the Sellers.

(j) No representations or communications, written or oral, with respect to
participation, eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual, or
coverage under the Business Benefit Plans have been made by the Sellers to any
participant or beneficiary thereof other than those which are in accordance
with the terms and provisions of such Business Benefit Plans.

2.13 _Legal Compliance_. Each Seller is, with respect to the Business, in
compliance, with all Applicable Laws (including rules and
regulations thereunder) of any Governmental Entity, currently in effect with
respect to the Business, except where the failure to comply therewith would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect. No
Seller has received written notice of any pending action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, claim, demand or notice relating to the Business
alleging any failure to so comply, except for any that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect.

2.14 _Legal Permits_. There are no material Legal Permits that are necessary
or required for the ownership or use of the Acquired Assets, other than the
Intellectual Property Rights or Technology, or for the operation or conduct of
the Business as currently conducted.

exclusively to the Business (other than a negotiation for a new or renewal of
a purchase order).

or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, whose fees will be paid
by Sellers.

the transactions contemplated hereby and the terms of their prospective
employment with SCI or Irish Newco, as the case may be, or their Affiliates,
in each case as and in the manner provided by Applicable Law.

(a) Each Seller shall permit each Buyer and its representatives to have
access (at reasonable times, on reasonable prior written notice and in a
manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the
Business) to the premises, properties, financial and accounting records,
contracts, and other Books and Records of or pertaining to the Business.  



 

21  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Sellers shall be obligated (i) to
provide any information, documents or access to any person unless such Buyer
is responsible, pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, for
the use and disclosure of any information obtained by such person from any
Seller, or such person enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Parent
on terms that are substantially the same as those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) to provide any information, documents or
access if the provision thereof would (A) violate Applicable Law (including,
without limitation, those relating to security clearance, data protection or
export controls) or any confidentiality agreement to which it is a party or
(B) cause the loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect thereto.
Prior to the Closing, each Buyer and its representatives shall not contact or
communicate with the employees, customers and suppliers of any Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the applicable Seller or in the case of
employees as provided in _Section 9.1_. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 4.3_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement
of any party hereto or any conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto.

(b) Each Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality
Agreement remains in full force and effect and that information provided by
any Seller or any of such Sellers Affiliates to any Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement prior to the Closing shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and each Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to treat
such information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and
each Buyer shall treat and each Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to treat
such information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. If the
Closing occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement, insofar as it covers
information relating exclusively to the Business, shall terminate effective
as of the Closing, but shall remain in effect insofar as it covers other
information disclosed thereunder that is not related to the Business.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Buyer and its representatives shall not have any access at any time prior to
the Closing to any information regarding pending or proposed bids for new
contracts or subcontracts or any related information where any Buyer or an
Affiliate of any Buyer also has submitted or intends to submit a bid for such
contract or subcontract.

4.4 _Exclusivity_. Each Seller shall not, and shall use its best efforts to
cause its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage the
submission of any proposal, offer or discussion with any Person (other than
the Buyers) concerning any merger, business combination, sale of stock or sale
of assets (other than sales of assets in the ordinary course of business)
involving the Business or the Acquired Assets (other than as part of a sale
of the Parent substantially in its entirety), (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, any Person (other than
the Buyers), or otherwise furnish to any Person (other than Buyers) any non-
public information, with respect to or concerning or intended to facilitate
any such transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of Sellers, whether or not such Representative is purporting
to act on behalf of  



 

22  Sellers, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.4_ by Sellers.
As of the date hereof, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion,
negotiation or other action conducted by Sellers or their Representatives
prior to the date hereof with respect to any such transaction.

4.5 _Schedules and Notices_. The Sellers shall be entitled to submit to SCI,
from time to time between the date hereof and date which is five (5) Business
Days prior to the earlier of the Closing Date or the Outside Date, written
updates to the Disclosure Schedules and other Schedules hereto disclosing any
events or developments that occurred or any information learned between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, except that Sellers may not
include in any such permitted updates any disclosures concerning events,
developments or information known or which reasonably could have
been discovered by the Sellers, in each case prior to or on the date hereof.
The Sellers representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
be construed for all purposes of this Agreement (including without
limitation,  _Section 5.1_ and Article VI) to be deemed to have been made
subject to the Disclosure Schedule and other Schedules hereto, as so updated
to the extent permitted hereunder; _provided that_ , the Buyer shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as a result of any such disclosure to the
extent provided in _Section 8.1(c)_.

4.6 _Irish Newco_. As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, SCI shall form Irish Newco and shall cause Irish Newco to execute a
joinder to this Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Sellers,

Buyers and their Affiliates in respect of, and hold the Buyers and their
Affiliates harmless against, all Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyers or
any Affiliate thereof resulting from or constituting:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement or the Parent Certificate;

(b) any failure by any Seller to perform any (i) covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement relating to actions to
be completed on or prior to Closing or (ii) covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement relating to actions to be taken
after the Closing;

(c) any Excluded Liabilities;

(d) the matter as described in _Schedule 1.2(c)(i)_ ; or

(e) the matters as described in _Schedule 1.2(c)(ii)_.



 

25 6.2 _Indemnification by SCI_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VI, from and after the Closing, SCI shall indemnify each Seller in
respect of, and hold each Seller harmless against, any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by any Seller or any Affiliate thereof resulting from or
constituting:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty of any Buyer contained in this
Agreement or the Buyer Certificate;

(b) any failure by any Buyer to perform (i) any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement relating to actions to
be completed on or prior to the Closing, or (ii) any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement relating to actions to
be taken after the Closing; or

(c) any Assumed Liabilities.

6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the following
procedures. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notification to the
Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any
action, suit or proceeding, relating to a third-party claim for which
indemnification may be sought (each, a " _Claim_ "). Such notification shall
include a description in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the
Indemnified Party) of the facts constituting the basis for such Claim and the
amount (or a good faith estimate of the amount) of the Damages claimed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice shall not limit the
right of an Indemnified Party to recover indemnity or reimbursement except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party suffers any material prejudice or
material harm with respect to such Claim as a result of such failure. Within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party
may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of
the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, if in such written notice, the Indemnifying Party states
that the Indemnifying Party would be liable under the provisions hereof for
indemnity in the amount of such Claim if such Claim were valid and that
the Indemnifying Party disputes and intends to defend against such Claim at
the Indemnifying Partys own cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume control of such defense as provided above, the Indemnified Party
shall control such defense at the expense of the Indemnified Party (and the
reasonable fees and expense of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this
Agreement). The Party not controlling such defense may participate therein at
its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice
from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit, proceeding or claim,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying
Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such  



 

26  defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such Claim and
the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the
other Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to
any settlement of a Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party; _except that_ , with respect to Claims for indemnification
under _Sections 6.1(d)_ and _6.1(e)_ of this Agreement, the second, third and
last sentence in _Section 1(c)_ of the Escrow Agreement shall apply. The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim that does not include a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any
liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party. 

(b) _Procedure for Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for
indemnification under this Article VI shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party
a Claim Notice. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case such response
shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), (ii) agree that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case
such response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), or
(iii) contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount; _provided_ that, in the case of a claim for indemnification
made pursuant to Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.1(e), which claim relates to a
settlement effected under 1(c) of the Escrow Agreement, Parent shall not have
the right to contest the claim under this Section 6.3(b). If the Indemnifying
Party in such response contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed
Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith
efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within sixty
(60) days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to
submit such dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 12.11._

(c) _Cooperation_. SCI and Parent shall cooperate with each other with respect
to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is
obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder.

6.4 _Survival_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Sellers and the Buyers set forth
in this Agreement, the Parent Certificate and the Buyer Certificate shall
survive the Closing and shall expire on the close of business on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 2.7(a)_ shall survive
the Closing and expire on the close of business on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date and the representations and warranties contained in _Sections
2.1_ , _2.2_ , _2.6_ , _2.7(b)_ , and _2.17_ and _Sections 3.1_,  _3.2_ and
_3.8_ shall survive the Closing without limitation.

(b) If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to
_Section 6.3_ prior to the expiration as provided in _Section 6.4(a) _of the
representation or warranty  



 

27  that is the basis for such claim, then such representation or warranty shall
survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim. 

6.5 _Limitations_.

(a) Parent shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer or its Affiliates and
shall not have any liability under _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)(i)_ and SCI
shall not be required to indemnify Parent or its Affiliates and shall not
have any liability under _Sections 6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b)(i)_ :

(i) unless the aggregate of all Damages for which such Party would, but for
this clause (i), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
1.25% of the Adjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of any such
excess;

(ii) for any individual items where the Damages relating thereto are less than
$100,000 and such items (other than a series of related items) shall not be
aggregated for purposes of clause (ii) of this _Section 6.5_; and

(iii) for Damages payable to the extent in excess of 10% of the Adjusted
Purchase Price.

_provided_ _however_ , that the limitations above shall not apply
in connection with (i) actual fraud by a Party with respect to any of its
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in the Parent Certificate,
or Buyer Certificate, as applicable, or (ii) the breach by a Seller of any of
the representations or warranties contained in _Section 2.1_, _Section
2.2_, _Section 2.6_, _Section 2.7(b)_ or _Section 2.17_ or breach by any
Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained in _Section
3.1_, _Section 3.2_ or _Section 3.8_.

(b) Each Buyer and Parent agree that the rights of the Buyers and their
respective Affiliates (each as Indemnified Parties) under Article VI of the
Agreement (as modified by _Section 1(c)_ of the Escrow Agreement) shall be
their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to claims covered by _Section
6.1(d)_ and _Section 6.1(e)_, including, without limitation, claims for
breach of contract. Parent shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnified
Parties and shall not have any liability under  _Section 6.1(d)_ and
_Section 6.1(e)_ thereof other than pursuant to the terms and provisions of
Article VI of this Agreement and of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Damages or other amounts under this Agreement that are consequential, in the
nature of lost profits, diminution in the value of property, special or
punitive or otherwise not actual damages.

(d) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
Article VI with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount
of any payment actually received by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate
thereof), with respect to the Damages to which such indemnity claim relates,
from an insurance carrier (net of any increased costs to such Indemnified
Party associated therewith or resulting therefrom). If an Indemnified Party
(or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in connection with any claim
for Damages  



 

28  for which it has already received an indemnification payment from the
Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within
thirty (30) days of receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the
excess of (A) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under
this Article VI with respect to such claim plus the amount of the insurance
payments received (net of any increased costs to such Indemnified Party
associated therewith or resulting therefrom), over (B) the amount of Damages
with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to
receive under this Article VI. 

(e) Except (i) with respect to claims for equitable relief, including specific
performance, made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) claims based on
theories of actual fraud , (iii) as provided in _Section 6.5(b)_ or (iv) as
provided in  _Section 10.3(e)_, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under
this Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims covered by 
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ or otherwise relating to the transactions
that are the subject of this Agreement.

6.6  _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Adjusted Purchase Price or the Irish Purchase Price, as the case may be.
Such treatment shall govern Tax Returns filed by the Parties, to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law.

6.7 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless any party (a) pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.2(a)_,

pursuant to _Section 6.4;_ (b) pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
6.2(b)(i)_ shall terminate upon the one year anniversary of the Closing Date;
(c) pursuant to _Sections 6.1(b)(ii)_ , _6.2(b)(ii)_ , _6.1(c)_ or _6.2(c)_
 shall not terminate; (d) pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)_ shall terminate upon
the fifth-year anniversary of the Closing Date; and (e) pursuant to _Section
6.1(e)_ shall terminate upon the second-year anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating
in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 6.3_ to
the party to be providing the indemnification.

(a) Any real property, personal property, intangible property or other ad

prior to the Closing as provided below:

(a) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent;

(b) SCI, on behalf of the Buyers, may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to the Parent in the event any Seller is in breach of any
representation or warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this
Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any other such

update to the Disclosure Schedule or other Schedule hereto pursuant to
_Section 4.5_ which contains information that, absent such disclosure and the
provisions of  _Section 4.5_ permitting the update of representations and
warranties, would have the effect of causing the condition set forth in
_Section 5.1(a)_ not to be satisfied, and the Sellers fail to cure the event
or condition causing the failure of such condition within thirty (30) days
following delivery by SCI to the Parent of written notice under this _Section
8.1(c);_

(d) the Parent, on behalf of the Sellers, may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to SCI in the event any Buyer is in breach of any

ARTICLE IX

EMPLOYEE MATTERS  

9.1 _Covenants Regarding Continuing Employees_.

(a) _Employment Offers to U.S. Employees and Specified Employees_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, SCI shall make
offers of employment to all U.S. Employees identified in _Schedule 9.1(a)-1_
who are eligible to work in the United States under Applicable Law and all
Specified Employees identified in _Schedule 9.1(a)-2_. An offer of employment
to a U.S. Employee or a Specified Employee shall be based upon the terms
applicable to U.S. Employees or Specified Employees, as applicable, as set
forth in _Schedule 9.1(a)-3_ , as such terms may be reasonably modified
prior to the Closing as mutually agreed by SCI and Parent (the " _Applicable
Terms_ ").

(b) _Continuing Employees_. On the Closing Date, U.S. Employees and Specified
Employees who accept employment or engagement with SCI will be considered to
have voluntarily resigned from their employment or engagement with the
applicable Seller or its Affiliate, and SCI shall thereafter, either directly
or through one of its Affiliates, employ or engage all such Continuing
Employees on the Applicable Terms in the case of U.S. Employees and Specified
Employees. After the date of this Agreement and to the extent not in
violation of Applicable Law, the Sellers shall permit SCI to contact and meet
with all such Employees at the applicable Sellers premises during normal
business hours, and the Sellers shall cooperate fully with SCI in all
such respects. To the extent that a Continuing Employee elects COBRA coverage
in respect of medical insurance under the applicable Business Benefit Plans,
SCI will pay for the Continuing Employees cost (in excess of the premiums
that the Continuing Employee would have been required to pay for coverage
under the Business Benefit Plans had the Continuing Employee remained an
employee of such Seller) to continue COBRA coverage for such medical insurance
for the Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents who
participated in such plans (as in effect on Closing Date) on the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date, commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing until December 31, 2008 or until the Continuing
Employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment with SCI (or its
Affiliate), whichever occurs first.

(c) _EU Employees_. The Buyers and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
contracts of employment of EU Employees shall not terminate upon the Closing.
Instead (save in the case of any EU Employee who validly objects to
transferring in accordance with  



 

32  Applicable Law), such contracts of employment of EU Employees identified in
_Schedule 9.1(c)_ shall, with the consent of such EU Employees,
transfer automatically to SCI (or relevant Affiliate of SCI), in accordance
with Applicable Law. All Employment Liabilities which existed on or prior to
the Closing in respect of EU Employees shall remain with, and be the
responsibility of, the Sellers, and all Employment Liabilities which arise
after the Closing in respect of EU Employees who so transfer to SCI or its
relevant Affiliate shall be the responsibility of SCI or its relevant
Affiliate.

(i) Where it is not possible or not legally required for SCI or its relevant
Affiliate to replicate an Employee Benefit Plan (including any retirement
benefit) for an EU Employee whose employment is transferred to SCI or its
relevant Affiliate by operation of Applicable Law, SCI or its relevant
Affiliate shall provide a benefit of substantial equivalence as contemplated
in _Schedule 9.1(a)-3_.

(ii) If, contrary to the expectations of the Parties, the contract of
employment of any EU Employee identified on _Schedule 9.1(c)_ which the
Parties expected to transfer automatically to SCI or its relevant Affiliate by
operation of Applicable Law is not so transferred, SCI or its relevant
Affiliate shall make the relevant Employee an offer of employment on the same
basis as that made to U.S. Employees pursuant to _Section 9.1(a),_ such offer
to be made within three (3) Business Days of SCI or its relevant Affiliate
becoming aware of such fact. 

(d) [Intentionally omitted.]

(e) The Buyers and each of the Sellers acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section 9.1_ with respect to Employees are
included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Employees,
any participant in any Business Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any
right to continued employment with the Buyers or any Affiliate of the Buyers.

(f) _Employee Liability Claims_. Except as provided in _Section 9.1(h)_
below:

(i) All Employment Liabilities, including, without limitation, COBRA
obligations, incurred in connection with the termination by the Sellers or
any Affiliate of the Sellers of any employment or engagement of any Employee
(whether a U.S. Employee, a Specified Employee or an EU Employee and including
any Employee who does not accept an offer of employment with the relevant
Buyer or does not consent to the transfer of his or her employment to such
Buyer) shall be borne by the Sellers.

(ii) All Employment Liabilities incurred in connection with the employment,
engagement or termination by any Buyer of any Continuing Employee on or after
the Closing Date shall be borne solely by such Buyer.

(g) _The Buyers Employee Plans_.



 

33 (i) Subject to _Section 9.1(c)_, with respect to Continuing Employees, (i)
the Buyers will allow such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
to participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by the Buyers or its
subsidiaries, other than during a period of continuing coverage under a
Business Benefit Plan elected under COBRA, on terms no less favorable than
those provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyers, (ii) each such
Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting under such plans for years of service with the
Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) the Buyers
will make all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-
existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group pension, health, life, accident or
disability plans of the Buyers in which such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents will participate to be waived and will provide credit for
any co-payments and deductibles prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such plans that may apply after the Closing Date.

(ii) Seller will (1) cause each Continuing Employee to vest in his or her
interest under Sellers 401(k) Plan no later than the Closing Date, (2)
provide each Continuing Employee with the right to receive a distribution of
his or her interest under the Sellers 401(k) Plan, and (3) timely provide
each Continuing Employee with an election to rollover his or her vested
interest to SCIs 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account. Buyers will
take all actions reasonably necessary to permit the Continuing Employees who
were U.S. Employees to make a direct rollover of his or her entire
account balance (including participant loans, to the extent not in default)
to SCIs 401(k) plan, to the extent such rollover is permitted by Applicable
Law and SCIs 401(k) plan. As a condition to SCIs acceptance of any
Continuing Employees rollover of his or her vested interest, SCI will be
entitled to receive from Seller a certificate from the plan administrator who
is a fiduciary of the Sellers 401(k) Plan or an opinion of counsel (with
customary qualifications) to the effect that either (i) the Sellers 401(k)
Plan has received a recent favorable determination letter as to its
qualification under the Code, and nothing has occurred since the date of such
letter and no condition exists which could reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualification, or (ii) the Sellers 401(k) Plan is qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, or that the plan is intended to be qualified
and the plan administrator is not aware of any plan provision or operation
that would result in the disqualification of Sellers 401(k) Plan.

(iii) The Buyers shall assume any of the Sellers immigration related
obligations and liabilities relating to Continuing Employees who are foreign
nationals of the country in which they are working, such as (but not limited
to), those arising in connection with filings by the Sellers of Labor
Condition Applications, nonimmigrant/immigrant visa petitions, work permit
applications or extensions and Applications for Alien Employment (Labor)
Certification. The Buyers and the Sellers intend that the Buyers (by agreeing
to hire the Continuing Employees formerly employed by the Sellers, and
agreeing, as a sponsoring employer, to assume the immigration-related
obligations and liabilities described above) shall be considered
the successor in interest to the Sellers solely and exclusively for the U.S.
immigration law purposes, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.



 

34 (iv) The Sellers and the Buyers shall comply with _Schedule 9.1(g)(iv)_ and
the procedures described therein in connection with the Sellers defined
benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes applicable to the EU
Employees who become Continuing Employees.

(h) On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay the Accrued U.S. Vacation
Liability to the Continuing Employees who are U.S. Employees. On the Closing
Date, SCI and/or Irish Newco, as applicable, shall assume the Accrued Non-U.S.
Vacation Liability, except to the extent that payment by the Sellers of any
such liability is required by Applicable Law. The Sellers shall pay to
each Continuing Employee on the Closing Date, or as soon thereafter as
reasonably practicable or as otherwise required by the applicable Business
Benefit Plan or Applicable Law, all compensation earned by and remaining
payable to such Continuing Employee, including, without limitation, all such
amounts earned under the Business Benefits Plans in accordance with their
terms.

(i) Sellers and Buyers shall comply with the Standard Procedure set forth in
Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, unless SCI elects in writing within
ten (10) days after the Closing Date to have the "Alternative Procedure" set
forth in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to the
processing, filing and transferring of Forms 941, W-2, W-3, W-4 and W-5 apply.
As soon as practicable after Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to SCI
a copy of any payroll records in Sellers possession for each Continuing
Employee to allow Buyers to comply with the Alternate Procedure set forth in
Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53.

(j) After the date of this Agreement and to the extent not in violation of
Applicable Law, the Sellers shall promptly provide to SCI all such
information as may be reasonably requested by the Buyers as necessary or
convenient in assisting the Buyers to satisfy its obligations under this
Article.

or similar expenses pertaining to employees of the providing Party.

(c) _Retention of Records_. Except as may otherwise be required by law or

specific Information, any Party may offer in writing to the other Party or
Parties to deliver such Information to the other Party or Parties, and if such
offer is not accepted within 90 days, the offered Information may be disposed
of at any time. 

10.2 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

(a) During the Restricted Period, the Sellers shall not and shall cause their
Affiliates not, to directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent
of SCI, engage in a Competitive Business Activity anywhere in the Restricted
Territory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions in this _Section
10.2_ shall not apply to any third party acquirer of any Seller or to any
Affiliates of such third party acquirer; _provided_ _that_ , neither of the
Sellers may grant any license or sublicense to any Licensed Intellectual
Property, Licensed Technology, Transferred Intellectual Property or
Transferred Technology to any such third party acquirer or any of its
Affiliates during the Restricted Period.

(b) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following terms shall
have the following meanings: 

(i) " _Competitive Business Activity_ " shall mean engaging in, whether
directly or as owner, partner, shareholder (other than in respect of an
ownership interest of less than 5% of the voting stock of any publicly traded
company), lender, investor, consultant, agent, co-venturer or otherwise, or

involving the Restricted Field, including, without limitation, the designing,
developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, licensing, supporting, and
maintaining of products intended by the Sellers or their Affiliates,
or specifically designed or marketed by the Sellers or their Affiliates, for
use in the Restricted Field; provided that none of the foregoing shall limit
the Sellers or their Affiliates ability to engage in business with any such
Persons for activities outside the Restricted Field during the Restricted

Property Rights, the Transferred Technology, the Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights or the Licensed Technology in such activities outside the
Restricted Field.

(ii) " _Restricted Territory_ " shall mean each and every country, province,
state, city or other political subdivision of the world, including without

is defined in the License Agreement; and

(iv) " _Restricted Period_ " shall mean the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date.

(c) The Parties hereto agree that the duration and area for which the
covenant not to compete set forth in this _Section 10.2_ is to be effective
is reasonable. In the event that any court determines that the time period or
the area or both of them are unreasonable and such covenant is to that extent
unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the covenant shall remain in full
force and effect for the greatest time period and in the greatest area that
would not render it unenforceable. The Parties hereto agree that damages are
an inadequate remedy for any breach of this covenant and that each Buyer
shall, whether or not it is pursuing any potential remedies at law, be
entitled to equitable relief if a court so decides in the form of preliminary
and permanent injunctions without bond or other security upon any actual or
threatened breach of this covenant.

10.3  _Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to the Closing, beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to (i) directly or indirectly, solicit
any Continuing Employee that is a Key Employee, except pursuant to
generalized solicitations by use of advertising or which are not specifically
targeted at such Continuing Employees, or (ii) hire any Continuing Employee
that is a Key Employee; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
the solicitation or hiring of any Person who becomes a Continuing Employee
and whose employment with any Buyer has been terminated by such Buyer or an
Affiliate of such Buyer;

(b) Subject to the Closing, beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to (i) directly or indirectly, solicit

targeted at the employees of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, or (ii)
hire any of the employees of the Parent or any of its Affiliates described in
the foregoing subsection (i); provided that the foregoing shall not restrict
the solicitation or hiring of any Person whose employment with Parent or its
Affiliates has been terminated by Parent or its Affiliates.



 

37 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Sellers and
the Buyers may waive the provisions of _Sections 10.3(b)_ or _(c)_ above in
writing at any time, provided that such waiver is executed by an authorized
officer of the Party waiving such provision.

(e) The Parties agree that the anticipated damages from a breach of the
covenants set forth in this _Section 10.3_ would be uncertain in amount and
would be difficult or impossible to ascertain and thus intend to liquidate
damages in advance, and have agreed that in the event that a Party or any
Affiliate of a Party has engaged in conduct which constitutes a breach of the
covenants set forth in this _Section 10.3_ (or this conclusion is determined
pursuant to arbitration as described in _Section 12.11_), the Parent or SCI,
as the case may be, shall pay as liquidated damages to the other Party an
amount equal to (i) in the case of any breach of _Section 10.3(a)_ or
_Section 10.3(b)_ by Sellers or their Affiliates, five (5) times the annual
base compensation of the applicable Employee as in effect on the date that
the breach was first deemed to occur, and (ii) in the case of any breach of
_Section 10.3(c)_ by Buyers or their Affiliates, one (1) times the annual
base compensation plus the targeted bonus amount of the applicable employee
as in effect on the date that the breach was first deemed to occur (the "
_Liquidated Damages_ "). The Parties agree that the Liquidated Damages are
reasonable and fair, and that such Liquidated Damages represent the sole
and exclusive remedy and consequence relating to any breach of the covenants
set forth in _Section 10.3_.

10.4 _Transition Period for Retained Marks_. Following the Closing, SCI shall
have the rights to use the Retained Marks to the extent set forth in the
Foundry Agreement, but otherwise will not hold itself out as having any

notice prepared with SCI directing visitors to such web sites expressing an
interest in the Products to SCIs web site. The Sellers will provide to SCI
for inclusion in SCIs or its Affiliates web sites, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing (but in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Closing Date), all such text, images and other
content. Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4_ hereof, prior to
including any such text, images or other content in its web site, Buyers
shall remove all references to the Retained Marks from any such text, images
or other content. The Sellers (or their Affiliates) shall retain ownership of
all their domain names and neither any Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any right or license to any such domain name. To the extent the Business
utilized any internet protocol address space allocated to the Sellers, such
internet protocol address space shall remain the property of the Sellers, and
no rights or licenses are granted to the Buyers with respect thereto.

10.6 _Payment of Assumed Liabilities or Accounts Receivables_. In the event
that any Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) inadvertently pays or discharges,
after the Closing, any Assumed Liabilities or any Buyer (or an Affiliate
thereof) inadvertently pays or discharges after the Closing, any Excluded
Liabilities, the other Party shall reimburse such paying Party for the amount
so paid or discharged within thirty (30) days of being presented with written
evidence of  



 

38  such payment or discharge. Following the Closing, in the event any Buyer or
any Seller (or their respective Affiliates) receives payment with respect to
