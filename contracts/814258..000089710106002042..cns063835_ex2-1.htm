outstanding as of the Effective Time of the Merger and that are held by a
stockholder of Company who has properly exercised such holders appraisal
rights under the DGCL (the " _Company Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost, such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Company Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the
DGCL and the holders of Company Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right at the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of such holders Company
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, the right to receive, without
any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Stock received by Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices.
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, or as required
by DGCL, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or
otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

  



  

  

2.3. _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option outstanding
as of the Effective Time of the Merger shall be treated in accordance with
Section 12.2 or Section 12.3, as applicable.

  

2.4. _Effect on Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time of the
Merger, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

   

2.5. _Exchange Procedures_.

   

(a) At the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.5 through the Exchange Agent, cash
in the amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to such holders of
Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for their shares of Company
Stock (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Such amounts may be invested by
the Exchange Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time of
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation; provided that such investments shall be
in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of
no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

  

(b) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail, promptly after
the Effective Time of the Merger, to each holder of record of shares of
Company Stock which are represented by (x) a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger represented outstanding
shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (y) an entry to that
effect in the shareholder records maintained on behalf of Company by the
Company stock transfer agent (the " _Book Entry Shares_ "), whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2 hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
(if any) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
Company may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or authorizing transfer and cancellation of
Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, or authorizing transfer of Book Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such shares of Company Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof (less any withholding Taxes pursuant to
Section 2.11), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5, each Certificate and
any Book Entry Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time of
the Merger to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate or transfer of the Book Entry Shares, as the case may be, as
contemplated

  



  

  

by this Section 2.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, if any holder of shares of Company Stock that are not Book Entry
Shares should be unable to surrender the Certificates for such shares, because
they have been lost or destroyed, such holder shall, if required by Parent or
Exchange Agent, deliver in lieu thereof a bond in form and substance and with
surety reasonably satisfactory to Parent and shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with
Section 2.2 hereof (less any withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.11).

  

(c) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Parent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

  

(d) If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates or Book
Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement, subject to the other provisions
of this Article 2.

  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to
the former stockholders of Company following the passage of twelve months
after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered (together with any
income received with respect thereto) to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any former stockholders of Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.5 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation and/or Parent, subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law, only as general creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration payable in consideration for any
Certificate or transfer of any Book Entry Shares.

  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed as of a
date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. Except as
otherwise required by law, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Stock or any other Person for any consideration from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  



  

  

 2.6. _Adjustments_. If after the date hereof and on or prior to
the Effective Date of the Merger, the outstanding shares of Company Stock
shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any
similar event shall occur, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

2.7. _Directors of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time of
the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
comprised of the persons serving as directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger. Such persons shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified.

  

2.8. _Executive Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time of the Merger, the executive officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be comprised of the persons serving as executive officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. Such
persons shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or termination.

  

2.9. _No Further Ownership Rights in Stock_. All Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to ownership of such
shares of stock. At and after the Effective Time of the Merger, there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and upon delivery of
the Merger Consideration upon surrender for exchange of Company Stock,
each such share of Company Stock shall be canceled.

  

2.10. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger shall, at the Effective Time of the Merger and by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, except that Article 1 thereof shall be
amended and restated to read "The name of the corporation is CNS, Inc." and,
as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and
as provided by law. The Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Company or Merger Sub, be the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
their terms and the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and as provided by law. 

  

2.11. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct, withhold and transmit to the
proper tax authorities from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of shares of Company Stock or Company Stock Options pursuant to
this Agreement any stock transfer Taxes and such amounts as are required to
be withheld under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and transmitted,
such withheld and transmitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the share of Company
Stock or Company Stock Option in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

ARTICLE 4.

  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY_ 

  



  

The following representations and warranties by Company to Parent and Merger
Sub are qualified by reference to the correspondingly numbered section of the
Company Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that an exception or matter
disclosed with respect to one representation or warranty shall also be deemed
disclosed with respect to each other warranty or

  



  

  

representation to which the exception or matter reasonably relates to the
extent such relationship is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure
contained in the Company Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of any item in such
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item is a
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has or had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Subject to the
preceding sentences of this paragraph, Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

4.1. _Incorporation, Standing and Power_. Company has been duly
organized, is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation
under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Company is
duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Company has delivered to Parent true and correct copies of the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as currently in effect.

  



   

4.2. _Capitalization_.

   



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 50,000,000
shares of Company Stock, and 8,484,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of business on
September 30, 2006 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), 19,294,570 shares of
Company Stock were issued and outstanding, 5,285,050 shares of Company Stock
were held in the treasury of Company, and no shares of Preferred Stock were
issued or outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of Company Stock are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, not subject to preemptive
rights, and issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state
securities laws, rules and regulations. From the close of business on the
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, (i) no Company Stock
Options or other options to acquire shares of Company Stock or Preferred Stock
have been granted, and (ii) no shares of Company Stock or Preferred Stock have
been issued or become outstanding, or have been sold or transferred from the
treasury of the Company, except Company Stock issued or sold from treasury
pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on the date
hereof in accordance with their terms.

  

(b) Except for Company Stock Options covering (as of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date) 1,549,539 shares of Company Stock granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans (estimating the number of shares
granted pursuant to the ESPP assuming all payroll withholding through the end
of the phase (as described in the ESPP) ending December 31, 2006 is used to
purchase shares at an exercise price based on the fair market value of a share
of Company Stock at the Commencement Date of the current phase, determined in
accordance with the ESPP), there are no outstanding options, warrants or other
rights in or with respect to the unissued shares of Company Stock or Preferred
Stock nor any securities convertible into such stock, nor any rights to
acquire from Company issued or unissued capital stock of Company, and Company
is not obligated to issue any additional shares of its capital stock or any
additional options, warrants or other rights in or with respect to the
unissued shares of such stock or any

  



  

  

other securities convertible into such stock. Section 4.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list (the " _Company Option List_ ") as of
the Capitalization Date setting forth the name of each holder of a Company
Stock Option (excluding outstanding options under the ESPP), the number of
shares of Company Stock covered by each such option, the vesting schedule of
each such option, the exercise price per share and the expiration date of each
such option.

  

(c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the
right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of Company may vote are
issued and outstanding. Except in respect of the issuance of Company Stock
upon the exercise of Company Stock Options, there are no outstanding
obligations of Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any options,
warrants or other rights in or with respect to the Company Stock or Preferred
Stock or any securities convertible into such stock (other than with respect
to the payment of or withholding of shares to cover the exercise price or
statutory tax withholding as permitted under the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Options or as expressly provided in Section 12.2 and Section
12.3).

  

4.3. _Subsidiaries_. Company does not have any Subsidiaries and
does not own, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, an equity
interest in any Person, except as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

   

4.4. _Financial Statements_.

    

(a) Company has previously furnished to Parent a copy of the Financial
Statements of Company. The Financial Statements of Company: (a) present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of Company as of the
respective dates indicated and its statements of operations and changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows, for the respective periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited Financial Statements, to normal year-end
adjustments in accordance with GAAP); and (b) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto).

  

(b) Companys adjusted gross sales (as defined in Section 4.4(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter) of Breathe Right Domestic (U.S.) and Fiber
Choice for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006, as used in calculating
net sales set forth in the unaudited financial statements of Company prepared
in accordance with GAAP and contained in Companys Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2006, when filed, will not be
materially less than the adjusted gross sales for such products as set forth
in Section 4.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

   

4.5. _Reports and Filings_.

   

(a) Company has filed or otherwise furnished all required forms,
reports, proxy statements, schedules, registration statements, certifications
and other documents with the SEC since March 31, 2003 (including all
amendments and supplements thereto filed prior to the date hereof, the
"Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC
(or, if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior

  



  

  

to the date hereof, as of the date of such filing), the Company SEC Documents,
including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents,
and none of the Company SEC Documents, including any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, when filed (or, to
the extent superseded or amended by a Company SEC Document filed subsequently
and prior to the date hereof, at the date of such subsequent filing),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of Company included in the Company
SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

  

(b) Each Company SEC Document containing financial statements that
has been filed with or submitted to the SEC since July 31, 2002, was
accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted by the
Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and at the time of filing or submission of each
such certification, such certification was true and accurate. To the knowledge
of the Company, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
reasonably expect to give such certifications when next due.

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.5(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, since March 31, 2003, neither the Company nor, to the Companys
knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Company has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or its respective internal accounting
controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No
attorney representing the Company, whether or not employed by the Company, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of the Company.

  

(d) Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information relating to Company is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Company by others within the Company. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge
of Company, Company has not identified any material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting. In connection
with the preparation and filing of its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2006, the Company disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date thereof, to Companys auditors and the audit committee of
Companys Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting which are

  



  

  

reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

  

4.6. _Authority of Company_. The execution and delivery by Company
of this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company
including, without limitation, the vote of the Board of Directors of Company
(which vote was unanimous) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement
and the Merger, including the agreement of merger (within the meaning of
Section 251 of the DGCL) contained herein. The Board of Directors has
unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Company adopt
the agreement of merger (within the meaning of Section 251 of the DGCL) at
the Company Stockholders Meeting, which resolutions have not as of the date
of this Agreement been subsequently rescinded or modified. This Agreement is a
valid and binding obligation of Company enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, conservatorship, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by general equitable principles. Except as set forth
in Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and
delivery by Company of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, nor compliance by Company with any of the provisions
hereof, will: (a) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of
its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws, as amended; (b)
constitute a breach of or result in a default, or event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default (or give rise to any rights of
termination, cancellation or acceleration, or unilateral rights to amend, or
any right to acquire any securities or assets, or any loss of benefit), under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, franchise, license, permit, agreement or other instrument or
obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which Company is a party or by which
Company or any of its properties or assets is bound; (c) result in the
creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on any of the properties or assets
of Company; or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation applicable to Company or any of its properties or assets,
except with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d), for such
violations, breaches, defaults or Encumbrances which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. No consent of, approval
of, notice to or filing with any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
any aspect of the business or assets of Company is required in connection
with the execution and delivery by Company of this Agreement or the
consummation by Company of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except (i) under the Exchange Act (including the filing

promulgated thereunder; (ii) applicable filings, notifications, approvals or

Company. No insurer under any such policy or bond has canceled or indicated an
intention to cancel or not to renew any such policy or bond or generally
disclaimed liability thereunder. Company is not in default under any such
policy or bond which is material to the operations of Company and all material
claims thereunder have been filed in a timely fashion.

valid leasehold interest in all material real property leased, used or

are reflected in the lease as in effect on the date hereof; (b) for current
taxes not yet due and payable; and (c) for such Encumbrances, if any, as do
not materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the
present use of such property. Company is in possession of the properties
purported to be so leased, and each such lease is valid without
default thereunder by the lessee or, to the knowledge of Company, the lessor.

party thereto and is in full force and effect, except for such failures to be

(a) any change in methods of accounting or accounting practices,
business, or manner of conducting business, of Company or any other event or
development that has had or would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect;

  

(b) any damage, destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not

and permits are in full force and effect in all material respects. The
respective properties, assets, operations and businesses of Company are and

with all such applicable licenses and permits. No proceeding is pending or,
to the knowledge of Company, threatened by any Governmental Entity which seeks
to revoke or limit any such

  



  

  

licenses or permits. Except for any failures to be in compliance that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of Company, any third party that is a manufacturer or contractor for
Company is in compliance with all licenses and permits from the United States
Food and Drug Administration and comparable foreign Governmental Entities
insofar as the same pertain to the manufacture of product components or
products for Company. To the knowledge of Company, no proceeding, inquiry or
investigation by any Governmental Entity is pending or threatened against any
third party that is a manufacturer or contractor for Company, which threatens
to revoke or limit any such licenses or permits or that otherwise would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the manufacture of product components or products for
Company.

  

4.19. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for liabilities or
obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, do not and would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, Company has no liabilities or obligations, either
accrued or contingent, of any nature that have not been: (a) reflected or
disclosed in the Financial Statements of Company; (b) incurred subsequent to
March 31, 2006 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices; or (c) disclosed in Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter

Company SEC Documents that such disclosure is applicable).

   

4.20. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

   

(a) Company has previously made available to Parent copies of current
documents constituting of each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, of which Company or any member of the same controlled group of
corporations, trades or businesses as Company within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA (" _ERISA Affiliates_ ") is a sponsor or participating
employer or as to which Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates makes
contributions or is required to make contributions and which is subject to any
provision of ERISA and covers any employee, whether active or retired, of
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, together with all amendments thereto,
all currently effective and related summary plan descriptions, the
determination letter from the IRS, the annual reports for the most recent
three years (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto, and Form
11-K, if applicable) and a summary of material modifications prepared in
connection with any such plan. Such plans are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the " _Employee Plans_ ," and are listed in Section 4.20(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. No Employee Plan is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Each Employee Plan that is
intended to be qualified in form and operation under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and the
associated trust for each such Employee Plan is exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code and Company knows of no fact that would materially
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan. No event has
occurred that will subject such Employee Plans to a material amount of tax
under Section 511 of the Code. All amendments required to bring each Employee
Plan into conformity with all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
and all other applicable laws have been made, except to the extent that such
amendments that would retroactively cover any period prior to the Effective
Time are not required to be adopted prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

  

(b) Company has previously made available to Parent copies or
descriptions of each plan or arrangement maintained or otherwise contributed
to by Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates which is not an Employee Plan and
which (exclusive of base salary and base wages and any benefit, in each case,
required solely under the law of any state) provides for any form of current
or deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock awards, stock-based
compensation or other forms of incentive compensation, or insurance, savings,
profit sharing, benefit, severance, change of control, retention, retirement,
retiree medical or life insurance, group health, disability, workers
compensation, welfare or similar plan or arrangement for the benefit of any
employee or class of employees, whether active or retired, of Company or any
of its ERISA Affiliates. Such plans and arrangements are hereinafter
collectively referred to as " _Benefit Arrangements_ "), and are listed in
Section 4.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in
Section 4.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there has been no material
increase in the compensation of or benefits payable to any senior executive
employee of Company since March 31, 2006, nor any employment, severance or
similar contract entered into with any such employee, nor any material
amendment to any such contract, since March 31, 2006.

  

(c) With respect to all Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements,
Company and its ERISA Affiliates are in compliance (other than noncompliance
the cost or liability for which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect) with the terms of such Employee Plans and
Benefit Arrangements, the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
governmental or court orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently
in effect, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, applicable to such
plans or arrangements. All government reports and filings required by law have
been properly and timely filed and all information required to be distributed
to participants or beneficiaries has been distributed with respect to each
Employee Plan. There is no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened
legal action, proceeding or investigation against or involving any Employee
Plan or Benefit Arrangement, other than routine claims for benefits. No
"prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could subject
the Company or any Person for whom the Company has an obligation to indemnity
to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of tax under Section
4975 of the Code (other than any such transaction the cost or liability of
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect). No Employee Plan is subject
to Title IV or Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. No "reportable event" as defined in ERISA has occurred with respect to
any of the Employee Plans. All contributions, premiums and other payments
required to be made to each of the Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangement
under the terms of the Employee Plan, Benefit Arrangement and ERISA, the Code
or any other applicable laws have been timely made. Except as required by law
or as set forth in Section 4.20(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
condition or term under any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement exists which
would prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
from terminating or amending any such Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement at
any time for any reason without liability to Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries (other than reasonable administrative notice
periods, ordinary administration expenses, reasonable administrative expenses
related to the termination process, or routine claims for benefits) that, in
the aggregate for all such liability under all such Employee Plans or Benefit
Arrangements, would not exceed $100,000.

   



  

   

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.20(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, all Company Stock Options granted after March 31, 2004 and, to the
knowledge of Company, prior to April 1, 2004, have been granted in compliance

applicable laws and (iii) the applicable provisions of Companys Certificate

event will (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of Company; (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation; or (iv)
result in the failure of any amount to be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code.

or employee of Company (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to the extent based on or arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of Company, and pertaining to

officers of Company, but only to the extent such agreements are listed in

the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving

much coverage as possible for such amount.

  

(c) The Indemnified Liabilities shall include all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
7.4.

  

(d) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and exculpation of individuals who were directors and officers
of Company prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, unless
such a modification is required by applicable law. If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,

or arrangements) or shall become eligible for the employee benefit plans and
benefit arrangements of Parent (including, without limitation, the medical,
dental, short and long term disability, life insurance, cafeteria plan, paid
time off and 401(k) Plan, including any matching contributions) on the same
terms as such plans and arrangements are generally offered from time to time
to employees of Parent in comparable positions with Parent, it being

the terms of any such Company Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement, Parent
shall be entitled from time to time to modify, terminate or supplement any
such employee plans or benefit arrangements or to substitute new employee
plans or benefit arrangements for such employee plans or benefit arrangements
in the exercise of their business judgment.

Parent in which any employees of Company first become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time of the Merger (" _New Plans_ "), Parent shall

credit any deductibles, co-payments or other out-of-pocket expenses for the
benefit plan year for each employee and dependent recognized or recognizable

to participate in the Companys Fiscal 2007 Incentive Plan and employed by
Company on the Effective Time of the Merger (and waiving any other employment
related condition under the Incentive Plan), (A) the cash incentive payment
under Companys Fiscal 2007 Incentive Plan determined (x) based upon eligible
earnings of each employee for the fiscal year through the Effective Time of
the Merger, (y) as if the last day of the month prior to the Effective Time of

objective is prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and (B) the additional

must waive any rights to receive any duplicate payment of a pro-rata bonus or
other payment duplicative of the payments described in clauses (A) and (B) of

comparable positions with Parent.

Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay and provide to
employees of Company whose employment terminates on or after the Effective
Date of the Merger severance benefits and other required benefits under
conditions and in amounts that are no less favorable to the employee than
those in the Companys Severance Pay Plan as in effect as of the Effective
Time of the Merger. Any such severance and other benefits under the Companys
Severance Pay Plan shall be in addition to, and shall not be reduced or
offset by any notice pay, severance pay or pay in lieu of notice required
under any federal or state statute or regulation.

   



  

   

(ii) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and perform all
of the obligations of Company under the terms of the Executive Employment
Agreements and to pay and provide to Employees of the Company whose
employment terminates on or after the Effective Date and who, as a
result, become eligible for benefits under the terms of the Executive
Employment Agreements, each and every benefit to which the employee is
entitled under the terms of the Executive Employment Agreements.

accelerate so that each such Company Stock Option shall, immediately prior to

Option and may be exercised by the holder thereof for any or all of such
shares as fully vested shares of Company Stock and (ii) provide that, upon the
Effective Time of the Merger, all outstanding Company Stock Options, to the
extent not exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
shall be cancelled (and each holder of a Company Stock Option shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto except as provided in this Section
12.2(a)(ii)) in exchange for a cash payment by Company of an amount equal to
(A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price per share of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option.

  

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest.

or take such actions as are required to delete as of the Effective Time of
the Merger the provision in any other Benefit Arrangements of Company
providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of Company
or any interest in respect of any capital stock of Company and to ensure that
following the Effective Time of the Merger no holder of a Company Stock Option
or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit
Arrangement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of
Company or the Surviving Corporation.

increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from
that in effect on the date hereof for such Offering Period; (b) subject to
consummation of the Merger, the ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately
before the Effective Time of the Merger (the " _ESPP Termination Date_ ");
(c) the Offering Period in effect as of the ESPP Termination Date shall
terminate on the ESPP Termination Date and the extent of each participants
purchase rights under the ESPP shall be determined based on the amount of
payroll deductions actually withheld on such employees behalf and credited to
such employees account as of the ESPP Termination Date; and (iv) upon the
Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP
shall be cancelled (and each participant in the ESPP shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except as provided in this Section 12.3) in
exchange for a cash payment by Company of an amount equal to product of (i)
the whole number of shares of Company Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole
number, that the participant would have been entitled to purchase under the
ESPP had such purchase rights not been cancelled (subject to the preceding
clause (c) and to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares
purchasable) and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
lesser of (x) 85% of the Merger Consideration and (y) 85% of the fair market
value of a share of Company Stock (determined as provided in the ESPP) on the
Commencement Date (as defined in the ESPP) of such Offering Period. Any excess
payroll deductions remaining in a participants account as a result of
rounding down or of share purchase limitations under the ESPP shall be
distributed to the applicable participant without interest. All amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 12.3 shall be subject to any required
withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest.

Directors authorizes the entry into) an agreement with respect to a Competing
Transaction; provided, however, that Company may only exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.1(i) if (i) Company shall
have complied in all material respects with Section 6.1(m); (ii) the Board of
Directors of Company, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, has reasonably determined in good faith that such
Competing Transaction is a Superior Proposal; (iii) Company has given Parent
at least five Business Days to respond to such offer or proposal for a
Competing Transaction (including the latest material terms, conditions and
third party in such offer or proposal) and then, in making the determinations
described in clauses (ii) and (iv), taken into account any proposal or offer,
in writing, which shall have been made by Parent to modify the terms of this
Agreement; (iv) the Board of Directors of Company has reasonably determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
exercise such right of termination would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law (provided, that for purposes of this Section
13.1(i) the term " _Competing Transaction_ " shall have the meaning set forth
in Section 6.1(m), except that the references to "15% or more" in the
definition of Competing Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority"); and (v) prior to or concurrently with such termination, Company
pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant to Section 13.2. 

  



  

   

13.2. _Effect of Termination_. 

   

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Company
or Parent as provided in Section 13.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and neither Company nor Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any further
obligation or liability to the other party except under the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3, Section 13.1(i) and this Section
13.2, each of which shall survive such termination; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful and
material breach of the warranties and representations made by it, or willful
and material failure in performance of any of its covenants, agreements
or obligations hereunder.

   

(b) If:

  

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(h); or

  

(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(i); or

  

(iii) (A) either Parent or Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 13.1(b), and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, an offer or proposal for a
Competing Transaction was made directly to the stockholders or to the Board of
Directors of Company or became publicly known, or any Person (other than
Parent and its Affiliates) publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an offer or proposal for a Competing Transaction, and (C)
Company enters into an agreement for, or consummates any Competing Transaction
with, any Person within 12 months after such termination of this Agreement; or

  

(iv) (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(d), and
(B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such breach, an
offer or proposal for a Competing Transaction was made directly to the
stockholders or to the Board of Directors of Company or became publicly known,
or any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an offer or proposal for a
Competing Transaction, and (C) Company enters into an agreement for, or
consummates any Competing Transaction with, any Person within 12 months after
such termination of this Agreement; or

  

(v) (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(e) or (g)
or Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(f), and the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not have been held prior to such
termination, and (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
such termination, an offer or proposal for a Competing Transaction was made
directly to the stockholders or to the Board of Directors of Company or became
publicly known, or any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an offer or
proposal for a Competing Transaction, and (C) Company enters into an agreement
for or consummates any Competing Transaction within 12 months after such
termination of this Agreement;

  



  

  

then Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ "), (x)
in the case Section 13.2(b)(i), no later than two (2) Business Days following
such termination, (y) in the case of Section 13.2(b)(ii), simultaneously with
such termination, and (z) in the case of Section 13.2(b)(iii), (iv) or (v), no
later than the time of Companys entering into an agreement for any Competing
Transaction with any Person or, if there is no such agreement, upon the
consummation of such Competing Transaction. For avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

  

(c) If Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent on the dates
specified in this Section 13.2, then Company shall pay Parent interest on such
unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , plus 2%, from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent.

  

(d) Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 13.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
have entered into this Agreement. Company acknowledges that its obligation to
pay to Parent any amounts due pursuant to this Section 13.2 is not subject to
the Company Requisite Vote or any other stockholder vote or approval being
obtained.

otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof.

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the

by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this

applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the
federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State
of Delaware, and (iv) consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in Section 14.2. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by

same manner and with substantially the same effect as originally set forth at
the date this Agreement was executed.

Effective Time of the Merger, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party
or parties to be bound thereby. No waiver of any term, provision or condition
of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or
construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, provision or
condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies. Except as
otherwise required by law, this Agreement, when executed and delivered, may be
modified or amended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by action of
the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company without action by
their respective stockholders. This Agreement may be modified or amended only
