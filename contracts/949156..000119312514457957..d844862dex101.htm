<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) This Guaranty is one of payment and performance, not collection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, be absolute, unconditional

existence of any claim, set off, defense or other right that the Guarantor may have at any time against any person, including, without limitation, the Guaranteed Party (in each case, other than any defense that Parent or Sub may have that payment of
the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not owed, or performance of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not due or has been satisfied, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement); (ii)&nbsp;any change, change of control,
restructuring or termination of the corporate existence of Parent or Sub; or (iii)&nbsp;any change in time, manner, place of payment, extension, renewal or any other terms of the Guaranteed Obligations (in each case, other than any defense that

any other person interested in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the &#147;<U>Transactions</U>&#148;), and all suretyship defenses generally (in each case, other than any defense that Parent or Sub may have

the Merger Agreement). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) The Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Guaranteed Party upon this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty. The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or

other person for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Guaranteed Party to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent, Sub or any such other person or to

Party shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent or Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar Proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party to so file shall not
affect the Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guaranty. In the event that any payment to the Guaranteed Party in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned or restored for any reason whatsoever, the
Guarantor shall remain liable under this Guaranty with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made, and the Guarantee shall be reinstated and shall continue even if otherwise terminated. </P>

shall affect any liability of the Guarantor or any Related Person with respect to fraud or any liability of Parent or Sub. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;8.06 of the Merger Agreement, this Guaranty is not intended to and shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Guaranty and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for, in the event the Effective Time shall have occurred, (i)&nbsp;the rights of the Guaranteed Party&#146;s
shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration and the other payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;the rights of each Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Party&#146;s heirs, executors, administrators and representatives

Merger Agreement under any circumstance other than pursuant to clause (ii)&nbsp;of this paragraph under circumstances wherein none of Parent, Sub or the Guarantor shall have any liability pursuant to the Merger Agreement or this Guaranty.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the date of termination of this Guaranty any Proceeding to enforce this Guaranty has been commenced or written notice of intent to seek recovery has been sent by the Guaranteed Party to the Guarantor, the
Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guaranty shall survive such termination until such Proceeding is finally and conclusively resolved. </P>

parties. The waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, or default under, this Guaranty shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such waiver or failure to insist on
