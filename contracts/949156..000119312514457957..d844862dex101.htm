Exhibit 10.1

 

GUARANTY AND PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT

 

This Guaranty, dated as of December 30, 2014 (this " _Guaranty_ "), is by
Fosun International Limited (the " _Guarantor_ ") in favor of Meadowbrook
Insurance Group, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the " _Guaranteed Party_ ").
Reference is hereby made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Miracle
Nova II (US), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "),
Miracle Nova III (US), Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Sub_ "), and the
Guaranteed Party, dated as of the date of this Guaranty (as the same may be
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Guaranty but not otherwise
defined have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

1\. _Guaranty_. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees,
as a primary obligor and not as a surety, to the Guaranteed Party, as and to
the extent provided in this Guaranty, the full and timely payment and
performance by Parent and Sub of all of Parents and Subs respective
covenants, obligations, undertakings and liabilities for damages and
otherwise under the Merger Agreement (as such covenants, obligations
undertakings and liabilities may be modified, amended, waived or terminated in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, collectively, the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The Guarantor acknowledges that it is receiving
benefits in connection with providing this Guaranty.

 

2\. _Terms of Guaranty_.

 

(a) This Guaranty is one of payment and performance, not collection.

 

(b) The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable. It is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the
following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:
(i) the existence of any claim, set off, defense or other right that the
Guarantor may have at any time against any person, including, without
limitation, the Guaranteed Party (in each case, other than any defense that
Parent or Sub may have that payment of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation
is not owed, or performance of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not due
or has been satisfied, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement); (ii) any change, change of control, restructuring or termination
of the corporate existence of Parent or Sub; or (iii) any change in time,
manner, place of payment, extension, renewal or any other terms of the
Guaranteed Obligations (in each case, other than any defense that Parent or
Sub may have that payment of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not owed,
or performance of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not due or has been
satisfied, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement). Furthermore, the Guarantor waives diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment,
demand for payment, protest, promptness, obligation to protect, secure or
perfect any security interest, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any
right to require the marshaling of assets of Parent, Sub or any other person
interested in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (the " _Transactions_ "), and all suretyship defenses generally (in
each case, other than any defense that Parent or Sub may have   that payment of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not owed, or
performance of the applicable Guaranteed Obligation is not due or has been
satisfied, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement).

(c) The Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or
proof of reliance by the Guaranteed Party upon this Guaranty or acceptance of
this Guaranty. The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively
be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in the Guaranteed
Partys reliance upon this Guaranty, and all dealings between Parent, Sub or
the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Guaranteed Party, on the other, shall
likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Guaranty. When pursuing its rights and remedies under this Guaranty
against the Guarantor, the Guaranteed Party shall be under no obligation to
pursue such rights and remedies it may have against Parent, Sub or any other
person for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by the Guaranteed Party to pursue such other rights
or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent, Sub or any such other
person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of offset, and any
release by the Guaranteed Party of Parent, Sub or any such other person or any
right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any liability under this
Guaranty, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of Law, of the Guaranteed Party.

(d) The Guaranteed Party shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to
any Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent or Sub becomes subject to a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar Proceeding, and the failure of the
Guaranteed Party to so file shall not affect the Guarantors obligations
under this Guaranty. In the event that any payment to the Guaranteed Party in
respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned or restored for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain
liable under this Guaranty with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if
such payment had not been made, and the Guarantee shall be reinstated and
shall continue even if otherwise terminated.

 

(e) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to
exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against Parent
or Sub or any other person liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement
of the Guarantors obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any
other agreement in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Guaranteed Party against Parent or Sub or any other person liable with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common Law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from Parent or
Sub or any other person liable with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set off
or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy
or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been irrevocably paid in full
in cash or otherwise fully satisfied and performed. If any amount shall be
paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at
any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all other amounts

 



2  payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be segregated from other
property and funds of the Guarantor, and such amount shall forthwith be paid
or delivered to the Guaranteed Party in the same form as so received (with
any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, whether matured or
unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other
amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising.

 

3\. _Agreement to Perform or Cause Performance_. The Guarantor shall be bound
by the covenants set forth in Article V of the Merger Agreement as if the
Guarantor were a party to the Merger Agreement as "Parent" and shall cause
each of its affiliates to make all filings and take or effect any and all
actions, necessary or advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment to the consummation of the Transactions to the extent required
under Section 5.06 the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Guarantor shall
cause Parent and Sub to comply with and fully perform their respective
obligations under the Merger Agreement.

4\. _Sole Remedies_. The Guaranteed Party agrees that it has no right of
recovery in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the Transactions against the
Guarantor, any former, current or future, direct or indirect, representative
of the Guarantor, any former, current or future, direct or indirect, holder
of any equity interests or securities of the Guarantor (whether such holder is
a limited or general partner, member, shareholder or otherwise but
specifically excluding Parent and Sub) or any former, current or
future representative of any of the foregoing (each such person, a " _Related
Person_ "), through Parent, Sub or otherwise, except for its rights against
the Guarantor under this Guaranty. Recourse against the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Guaranteed Party and
all of its Subsidiaries against the Guarantor or any Related Person in respect
of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the
Merger Agreement or the Transactions. The Guaranteed Party hereby covenants
and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to institute, any Proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the Transactions, against the
Guarantor or any Related Person, except for claims of the Guaranteed Party
against the Guarantor under this Guaranty. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Guaranty, nothing set forth in this Guaranty shall
affect any liability of the Guarantor or any Related Person with respect to
fraud or any liability of Parent or Sub. Except as provided in Section 8.06 of
the Merger Agreement, this Guaranty is not intended to and shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this
Guaranty and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for, in
the event the Effective Time shall have occurred, (i) the rights of the
Guaranteed Partys shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration and the
other payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) the rights of
each Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Partys heirs, executors,
administrators and representatives under Section 5.09 of the Merger
Agreement.

5\. _Termination_. This Guaranty shall terminate (other than Sections 2, 6, 8,
9, and 11 through 19) and the Guarantor shall have no further obligation
under this Guaranty as of the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time and
the full performance of Parents and Subs obligations with respect to the
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration; (ii) 120 days

 



3  following the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms by mutual consent of Parent and the Guaranteed Party; and (iii) 120 days
following the termination of the Merger Agreement under any circumstance
other than pursuant to clause (ii) of this paragraph under circumstances
wherein none of Parent, Sub or the Guarantor shall have any liability pursuant
to the Merger Agreement or this Guaranty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
on the date of termination of this Guaranty any Proceeding to enforce this
Guaranty has been commenced or written notice of intent to seek recovery has
been sent by the Guaranteed Party to the Guarantor, the Guarantors
obligations under this Guaranty shall survive such termination until such
Proceeding is finally and conclusively resolved.

 

6\. _Expenses_. The Guarantor shall pay the Guaranteed Party, on demand by the
Guaranteed Party from time to time, the amount of all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, paid or incurred by the
Guaranteed Party in enforcing any of its rights under this Guaranty against
the Guarantor.

 

 _7\. Continuing Guarantee_. Until terminated pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 5_ of this Guaranty, this Guaranty shall (i) be a continuing one
and shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment and
satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) shall be binding upon
the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (iii) shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Guaranteed Party and its successors and
assigns. All obligations to which this Guaranty applies or may apply under the
terms of this Guaranty shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in
reliance on this Guaranty.

8\. _Entire Agreement_. This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement of the
parties and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter of this Guaranty, except for the Merger Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement.

9\. _Amendments and Waivers_. This Guaranty may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties. The waiver by any party
of any breach or violation of, or default under, this Guaranty shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties
to be bound thereby, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

10\. _Counterparts_. This Guaranty may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties to this Guaranty in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Guaranty (in counterparts or
otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Guaranty.

11.  _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
under this Guaranty shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given (a) when delivered or sent if delivered in person or sent by facsimile
transmission or e-mail (provided that telephonic confirmation of facsimile or
e-mail transmission is obtained), (b) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after
dispatch by registered or certified mail or (c) on the next Business Day if

12\. _Governing Law; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof.

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which money damages, even if
available, wound not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Guaranty were not performed, or were threatened to
be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Guaranty and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

13\. _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

(a) Any claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Guaranty, including the formation, performance, breach, termination,
enforceability, interpretation or validity of this Guaranty, shall be fully
and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC Rules_ ") by
a tribunal of three arbitrators. The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted as
follows: each of the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Party shall nominate one
arbitrator in accordance with the ICC Rules and the two party-nominated
arbitrators shall then nominate the third arbitrator who shall act as the
president of the tribunal. Each of the three arbitrators shall be fluent in
English. The place of arbitration shall be London, England. The language of
the arbitration shall be English and all written submissions to the arbitral
tribunal, as well as all orders and awards of the arbitral tribunal, shall be
in English. Where a breach or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in
this Guaranty has been established, the arbitral tribunal shall have the
authority to, upon the request of an aggrieved party, render an award for
injunctive or other equitable relief as provided in _Section 12_ hereof, such
remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any party may be
entitled at law or in equity. Any award of the arbitral tribunal shall be
final and binding on the parties and judgment may be entered on the award in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the Guarantor and the Guaranteed Party irrevocably and
unconditionally:

 

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Proceeding relating to the
recognition or enforcement of any award issued by an arbitral tribunal
pursuant to _Section 13(a)_, to the jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong,
China and the State of New York sitting in the County of New York and the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
agrees that all claims in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Hong Kong or New York courts or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such federal court;

 



6 (ii) waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Guaranty, (x) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts in Hong Kong or New York as described in this
Guaranty for any reason (other than a failure to serve process as described
in _Section 13(b)(iii)_), (y) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (z) that (A) the Proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) an
arbitration award issued pursuant to _Section 13(a)_ may not be enforced in
or by such courts;

 

(iii) agrees that notice delivered as provided in this Guaranty shall
constitute sufficient service of process for purposes of any Proceeding
brought by any party or its affiliates or successors and assigns, and each
party further waives and agrees not to assert any argument that such service
is insufficient; and

 

(iv) agrees that nothing in this Guaranty shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
New York or Hong Kong.

14\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants to the Guaranteed Party as to each of the matters set forth on Annex
I of this Guaranty.

15\. _No Assignment_. Neither this Guaranty nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Guaranty shall be assigned or transferred, in whole
or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any assignment or transfer in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.

16\. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS GUARANTY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
GUARANTY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTY BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
16_.

17\. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Guaranty is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Guaranty shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the 

 



7  economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Guaranty so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner; provided, however, that
this Guaranty may not be enforced without giving effect to the provisions of
_Sections 4_ and _5_ of this Guaranty. No party shall assert, and each party
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to assert, that this Guaranty or
any part of this Guaranty is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

18\. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Guaranty are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Guaranty.

19\. _Interpretation_. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Guaranty shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For
purposes of this Guaranty, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (b) the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; (c) the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and (d) the neuter
gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Guaranty,
the words "include" and "including," and words of similar meaning, shall
not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all
references in this Guaranty to "Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits," are
intended to refer to Sections of this Guaranty and the Annexes and Exhibits to
this Guaranty. All references in this Guaranty to "$" are intended to refer to
U.S. dollars. The term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Guaranty, refer to this Guaranty as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Guaranty. References herein to "as of the date hereof," "as
of the date of this Guaranty" or words of similar import shall be deemed to
mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Guaranty."
The headings contained in this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Guaranty.

existing and in good standing, under the Laws of Hong Kong. The Guarantor
has requisite company power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing, in good
standing or have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate,

consummation of the Transactions or the Guarantors ability to enter into this
Guaranty or perform it obligations under this Guaranty.

(b) _Authority Relative to Guaranty_. The Guarantor has the requisite company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty. The execution,

and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Guaranty
by the Guaranteed Party) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(c) _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(i) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Guaranty by the

of incorporation, by-laws or any equivalent organizational or governing
documents of the Guarantor; (ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable
to the Guarantor or any of its properties or assets; or (iii) require any
consent or approval or payment under, violate, conflict with, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default under
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or result in, or give to
others any right of, any termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted
Lien) upon any of the respective properties or assets of the Guarantor
pursuant to, any Contract to which the Guarantor is a party (or by which any
of its properties or assets is bound) or any Permit held by it or them,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for (A) any such consents and
approvals, the failure to obtain which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability
of the Guarantor to consummate the Transactions, or the Guarantors
ability to enter into this Guaranty or perform its obligations under this
Guaranty and (B) any such conflicts, violations, breaches, losses, defaults,
terminations, rights of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Guarantor to consummate the Transactions, or the Guarantors ability to enter
into this Guaranty or perform it obligations under this Guaranty.

(ii) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Guaranty by the

termination or expiration, as applicable, of waivers, consents, approvals,
waiting periods or agreements required under any Antitrust Laws, (iii)
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance or the Rules
Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
Limited; (iv) compliance with any applicable international, federal or state
securities "blue sky" Laws; and (v) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits of, or to make such
filings, registrations with or notifications to, any Governmental Entity would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of the Guarantor to consummate the Transactions,
or the Guarantors ability to enter into this Guaranty or perform its
obligations under this Guaranty.

 

(d) _Litigation_. As of the date of this Guaranty, there is no Proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against the
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of their respective
properties or assets are subject that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, or the Guarantors
ability to enter into this Guaranty or perform it obligations under this
Guaranty. As of the date of this Guaranty, none of the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction,

this Guaranty or perform it obligations under this Guaranty.

acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic
interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Guaranteed
Party.

(f) _Financing_. The Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform
its obligations under this Guaranty, and all funds necessary for the
Guarantor to fulfill its obligations under this Guaranty shall be available to
the Guarantor for so long as this Guaranty shall remain in effect in
accordance with _Section 5_ of this Guaranty.
