   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ and  _2.2(b)_ below. The Purchase Price, as

2.2 Purchase Price Adjustment. 

   

 (a) _Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment_. At least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser an estimated combined balance sheet of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the month end immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), which shall include the Working Capital as of such month-end date (" _Estimated RQ Working Capital_ "). The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated RQ Working Capital shall be prepared in good faith and in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements.

No later than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller of any objections to the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, which notice shall state in reasonable detail the basis for Purchasers objections. If Purchaser has any objections, Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections; _provided, however_ , that in the event that any such objections are not resolved prior to Closing, the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall remain as initially delivered to Purchaser for all purposes hereunder. The Purchase Price to be paid at Closing by Purchaser shall, (i) if the Estimated RQ Working Capital is a positive amount, be increased by such amount, or, (ii) if the Estimated RQ Working Capital is a negative amount, be decreased by such amount. 

   

 (b) _Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (i) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to GEC a combined balance sheet of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), which shall include the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date RQ Working Capital_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date RQ Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements. 

   

 (ii) If, within 30 days following delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, GEC has not given Purchaser written notice of its objection as to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or calculation of the Closing Date RQ Working Capital (which notice shall state in reasonable detail the basis of GECs 

   ##### 

  

   

objection), then the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Purchasers calculation of
the Closing Date RQ Working Capital as of the Closing Date shall be binding
and conclusive on the parties for all purposes hereunder. Upon prior
reasonable notice, Purchaser shall provide GEC access to all relevant
documents and information reasonably requested by GEC in connection with its
review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet. 

   

 (iii) If GEC duly gives Purchaser such notice of objection within the 30-day period, and if GEC and Purchaser fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Purchasers calculation of the Closing Date RQ Working Capital within 30 days of Purchasers receipt of GECs objection notice, GEC and Purchaser shall submit the issues remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm mutually determined by GEC and Purchaser that has not performed accounting, tax or audit services for Purchaser, GEC, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates during the past three years (the " _Accountants_ "), for resolution in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements. If issues are submitted to the Accountants for resolution, (A) GEC and Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Accountants may request and are available to that party or its agents and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss issues with the Accountants; (B) the determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both GEC and Purchaser within 60 days of the submission to the Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in calculation of the Closing Date RQ Working Capital; and (C) GEC and Purchaser will each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Accountants for such determination. 

   

 (iv) Within three business days after the Closing Date Balance Sheet becomes binding and conclusive pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_, the following adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made: 

  

       | (A)  |   | In the event that the Closing Date RQ
Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Date RQ Working
Capital, then GEC shall pay an amount equal to the difference between
the Estimated Closing Date RQ Working Capital and the Closing Date
RQ Working Capital to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to the wire transfer instructions provided by
Purchaser; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | In the event that the Closing Date RQ Working Capital
is greater than the Estimated Closing Date RQ Working Capital, then Purchaser
shall pay an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Date   
  

  ##### 

  

  

      |   |   | RQ Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Date
RQ Working Capital to GEC by wire transfer of immediately available
funds pursuant to the wire transfer instructions provided by GEC.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (c) Any payments made under this _Section 2.2_ shall be treated by GEC, Seller and Purchaser as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the recipient of such payment causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes.

 (e) In the event that (i) GEC makes payments under its Supplemental Salary Deferral (SUDCOMP) plan to Company Covered Employees that may be categorized as income reportable on Form W-2 during 2007 with respect to such Company Covered Employees, or (ii) the Company Covered Employees exercise options to acquire common stock of GEC that results in income reportable on Form W-2 during 2007 with respect to such Company Covered Employees, the parties will cooperate with respect to reporting such amounts as required by applicable Law on Forms W-2 prepared by GEC or Purchaser, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, GEC shall be and remain responsible for the payment of all Taxes and expenses, and shall be entitled to all Tax benefits, with respect to such Supplemental Salary Deferral (SUDCOMP) Plan and the exercise of such stock options.

The Companies (or any Subsidiary of any Company, as applicable) shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements for group health plans under COBRA for all former employees (and their respective beneficiaries and dependents) of the Companies and any Subsidiary thereof who are receiving COBRA continuation coverage as of the Closing Date and for all former employees and Company Covered Employees (and their respective beneficiaries and dependents) who are entitled to elect such coverage on account of a qualifying event occurring on or before the Closing Date, in each case, to the extent such right to such continuation coverage arose or arises under a Plan sponsored by a Company or any Subsidiary of any Company. 

   

 (g) GEC shall provide Purchaser with correctly completed I-9 forms (the " _I-9 Forms_ ") and attachments with respect to all Company Covered Employees (excluding 

   ##### 

  

   

any Company Covered Employees whose employment commenced prior to the time at
which I-9 Forms were required to be entered into under applicable Law). 

   

 (h) Simultaneously with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, GEC and Seller agree to distribute the vested account balances of the Company Covered Employees under the GEC Supplemental Salary Deferral (SUDCOMP) Plan to such individuals in accordance with the provisions of the GEC Supplemental Salary Deferral (SUDCOMP) Plan. 

   

 (i) Within two (2) business days before the Closing, GEC shall provide to Purchaser a list of all active employees and employees out on leave of the Companies and their Subsidiaries which list will include the employee name, date last worked and, where applicable, expected date for return to work status.

At the Closing, GEC shall pay or make provision for the release of guaranties of the Companies and their Subsidiaries related to the contracts, agreements and obligations of GEC, Seller and any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries). _Section 6.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth all such guaranties. 

  

 6.11 Supplements to Disclosure Schedule. If GEC or Seller becomes aware of, or there occurs after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, any fact or condition that constitutes a Seller Material Adverse Effect or a material breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in _Article 4_ (without giving effect, for purposes of this _Section 6.11_, to any qualifications as to materiality or " _Material Adverse Effect_ " or any similar qualification contained in such representations or warranties), or if any fact or condition, either currently existing or hereafter occurring, otherwise requires any change in the Disclosure Schedule delivered to Purchaser at the time of execution of this Agreement, Seller will promptly disclose such fact or condition to Purchaser and deliver to Purchaser a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_") specifying any needed change. In addition, if prior to the Closing, Purchaser becomes aware of any fact or condition that constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller, Purchaser will promptly disclose such fact or condition to Seller. Any Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to amend the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Article 10_ have been satisfied and shall not be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty or to limit the rights and remedies of Purchaser under this Agreement for any breach of such representations and warranties.

   ##### 

  

   

Affiliated Group on or prior to the Closing Date (including, without
limitation, by reason of the liability of either Company or any of
their Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof) pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or
similar provision under state, local or foreign Law)); and (iv) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Tax representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and any
breach of any Tax covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (without
regard to disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, GEC and Seller shall not
be required to indemnify Purchaser or the Companies and their Subsidiaries
for any Tax to the extent such Tax is specifically accrued as a liability for
Taxes in arriving at the working capital adjustments pursuant to _Section
2.2_ of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Unless prohibited by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall cause the taxable period of the Companies and their Subsidiaries to close as of the close of business on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Companies and their Subsidiaries were closed at the close of the Closing Date. However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes such as real and personal property taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis. 

  

 8.2 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. 

    

 (a) _Income Tax Returns_. GEC will be responsible for and will cause to be prepared and duly filed (i) all Tax Returns of the Companies and their Subsidiaries that are due before the Closing Date (taking account of extensions of time to file such Tax Returns) and (ii) all Tax Returns of the Companies and their Subsidiaries that are income Tax Returns and are prepared on a consolidated, unitary, or combined basis and that include GEC or Seller for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. GEC shall include the income of the Companies and their Subsidiaries on GECs consolidated federal income Tax Returns (and any foreign or state consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Returns) for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date and pay any income Taxes attributable to such income. The Companies and their Subsidiaries shall furnish Tax information to GEC for inclusion in GECs federal consolidated income Tax Return (or other Tax Return described in the preceding sentence) for the period that includes the Closing Date in accordance with the Companies and their Subsidiaries past custom and practice. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Other Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Companies and their Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date (other than Tax Returns with respect to periods described in  _Section 8.1(a)_) and, subject to the right to payment from GEC under the next sentence, Purchaser shall pay all Taxes shown as due on those Tax Returns. Not later than two (2) days prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns, GEC shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes owed by GEC pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(a)_. 

   

 (c) _Review Rights_. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, Purchaser shall provide GEC with drafts of all Tax Returns prepared by it pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_, but only to the extent such Tax Returns would reflect a Tax liability for which GEC is responsible under this Agreement. The reviewing party shall have the right to review and provide comments on Tax Returns during the fifteen (15)-day period following the receipt of such Tax Returns. GEC and Purchaser shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of any Tax Returns described in this _Section 8.2(c)_ and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return) by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by both Purchaser and GEC. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis. The costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and GEC. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct, without prejudice to the other partys rights and obligations under this _Article 8_. 

  

8.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. 

    

 (a) Purchaser and GEC shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this  _Article 8_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. GEC and Purchaser agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies or a Subsidiary of a Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or GEC, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Purchaser so requests, GEC shall allow Purchaser to take possession of such books and records. 

   

 (b) Purchaser and GEC further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be 

   ##### 

  

   

imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby). 

  

 8.4 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any income Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser, either Company or any Subsidiary, and any amounts credited against income Tax liability of Purchaser, a Company or any Subsidiary for which GEC is not liable and that relate to income Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, other than any such refunds or credits of Tax that are (a) attributable to a loss, credit or other tax attribute arising in periods beginning after the Closing Date (including the portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date) or (b) reflected as an asset on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall be net of any Taxes incurred in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit and net of any other expenses attributable thereto be for the account of GEC paid over to GEC within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

   

 8.5 Section 338(h)(10) Election and Purchase Price Allocation. 

    

 (a) GEC and Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall join together in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and all corresponding elections under state, local or foreign law) (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_") with respect to the shares of stock of the Companies that are purchased by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and, at the request of Purchaser, shares of stock of any Subsidiaries of the Companies. GEC and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser by taking all steps necessary in order to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with applicable laws (including, without limitation, the preparation of IRS Form 8023 and all similar state and local forms and submitting any ruling request, prepared by and at the sole expense of Purchaser on behalf of GEC, the Seller or the Companies, as the case may be, the applicable taxing authorities with respect to such election). At the request of the Purchaser, GEC and Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser on the Closing Date (or such later time as requested by Purchaser) an executed IRS Form 8023 (and all applicable corresponding state or local forms) with respect to the Companies and their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of the Purchaser, GEC and the Seller shall convert each of the Companies (and, at the discretion of the Purchaser, each of the Subsidiaries that is not a limited liability company) into a limited liability company before the Closing Date in lieu of the parties making the Section 338(h)(10) Election set forth above, provided that Purchaser provides a written notice of such request to GEC and Seller no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date (the " _LLC Conversion_ "). 

   

 (b) Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to GEC a draft schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the stock of the Companies and allocating the "aggregate deemed sales price" within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to each of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, among the assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Allocation_ "). Within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Allocation, GEC shall notify Purchaser of any proposed changes. If the parties cannot agree on the 

   ##### 

  

   

Allocation, the dispute shall be resolved by an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually determined by Purchaser and
GEC. The Allocation shall be used in preparing IRS Form 8883 (and all similar
forms required under state or local Law), which form shall be completed,
executed, and delivered by the parties as soon as reasonably practicable
after the finalization of the Allocation, but in no event later than sixty
(60) days before the due date for the filing of such form. Any payments
subsequent to the Closing Date (such as indemnity payments under the terms of
this Agreement) that are treated as an adjustment to purchase price of the
assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for tax purposes shall be
reflected as an adjustment to the price allocated to a specific asset, if
any, giving rise to the adjustment and if any such adjustment does not relate
to a specific asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among the Company
assets in accordance with the Allocation method provided in this _Section
8.5(b)_. In the event that Purchaser has made the election to proceed with a
LLC Conversion, the provisions described in this paragraph shall continue to
apply, except that the reference to "Allocation" shall be an allocation of
the purchase price for tax purposes that is done in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder and the applicable form
used to reflect the Allocation shall be IRS Form 8594 (and all similar forms
required under state or local Law). 

   

 (c) Purchaser, GEC and Seller agree to file and agree to cause each of the Companies and their Subsidiaries to file all federal, state, local and foreign Returns in accordance with the Allocation (as originally proposed or as revised in accordance with this Agreement, as the case may be) and, except as required pursuant to a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or corresponding provisions of state or local Law), not to take, or cause to be taken, any action that would be inconsistent with such Allocation in any Return, audit, litigation or otherwise. 

  

 8.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by GEC, except that any transfer Taxes arising from the distribution of RHAC Holdings, LLC and Waipouli Holdings, LLC shall be borne by GEC. 

   

 8.7 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax allocation, sharing or indemnity agreement or arrangement (other than this Agreement), whether or not written, that may have been entered into by Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller), on the one hand, and either Company or any of their Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and no payments (or any other obligations) that are owed by or to either Company or their Subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be required to be made (or performed) thereunder. 

   

 8.8 Tax Proceedings. 

    

 (a) In the event (i) Purchaser (or its Affiliates) or (ii) GEC (or its Affiliates) receives notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments by any Tax authority or other disputes concerning Taxes with respect to which the other party may incur liability under this _Article 8_ (or otherwise), the party in receipt of such notice shall 

   ##### 

  

   

promptly notify the other party of such matter in writing. The failure by
Purchaser to provide such notice on a timely basis, however, shall not
release GEC from any of its obligations under this _Article 8_, except to
the extent that GEC is prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) GEC shall have the right to defend, object to or prosecute, at its sole cost and expense, those Tax claims relating to periods ending on or before the Closing Date. GEC may in its discretion settle or compromise any such Tax claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the results of such Tax claim could affect the Tax liability of Purchaser, the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries for any Tax period including or ending after the Closing Date, then GEC shall not settle or compromise such Tax claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. With respect to Tax claims relating to periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are controlled by GEC and the settlement of which requires Purchasers consent pursuant to this paragraph, Purchaser or its authorized representatives shall be entitled, at the expense of Purchaser, to attend and participate in all proceedings relating to such Tax claim. Purchaser shall have the right to defend, object to or prosecute all other Tax claims. 

  

 8.9 Treatment of Indemnity Payment. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties agree that any indemnity payments under the terms of this Agreement and any payment under  _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for income tax purposes. 

   

 8.10 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state or local, or any foreign, tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by Purchaser, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holders of Shares in respect of which Purchaser made such deduction and withholding. 

   

 8.11 Conflict with Article 10\. In the event of any conflict between _Article 10_ and this _Article 8_ with respect to indemnification for Taxes, this _Article 8_ shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Sections 8.1(a)_ and _8.2_ are not subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.5_ hereof. 

   

ARTICLE 9

 10.4 Procedure for Matters Involving Third Parties. 

    

 (a) If any third party shall notify either of the parties to this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other party to this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this  ##### 

  

   

 _Article 10_, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly issue a Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto. 

   

 (b) An Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days following the receipt of the Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party desires to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party thereafter conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently. 

   

 (c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with _Section 10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, except the Indemnifying Party may consent to the entry of judgment or settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party if the judgment or settlement is solely for money damages. 

   

 (d) In the event any of the conditions in _Section 10.4(b)_ is or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from the Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (e) A party suffering Losses that gives or could give rise to a claim for indemnification under this _Article 10_ shall promptly notify the other party thereof in writing (a " _Claim Notice_ ") in accordance with _Section 11.1_. The Claim Notice shall contain a brief description of the nature of the Losses suffered and, if practicable, an aggregate dollar value estimate of the Losses suffered. No delay in the issuance of a Claim Notice shall relieve either party from any obligation under this  _Article 10_, unless and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party is thereby prejudiced. 

  

10.5 Limitations on Sellers and GECs Indemnification Liability. 

    

 (a) _Ceiling_ : Sellers and GECs aggregate liability for indemnification claims under this _Article 10_ arising from breaches of representations and warranties in  _Article 4_ hereof, shall not exceed $27,281,250 (the " _Cap_ "). 

   

 (b) _Deductible_ : Seller and GEC shall have no liability for indemnification claims under _Article 10_ arising from breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and/or agreements hereunder by Seller and/or GEC, unless and until the aggregate Losses claimed under _Article 10_ exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _Exceptions to the Cap and Deductible_. The limitations in subsections (a) and (b) of this _Section 10.5_ shall not apply to (i) breaches of _Sections 4.2_ ("Authority"), _4.4_ ("Capitalization"), or _4.14_ ("Taxes"), (ii) Losses arising out of or related to the matters set forth in clause _(b)_ , _(c)_ or  _(d)_ of _Section 10.2_, (iii) any claims found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (iv) any failure of GEC to pay any post-closing purchase price adjustment required to be made by GEC pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, (v) breaches of _Section 6.14_ hereof, (vi) the right of the Purchaser to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_, (vii) any claims under the Transition Services Agreement, and (viii) the obligation of GEC to pay fees or expenses as set forth in _Section 8.6_ and the last sentence of _Section 6.6_. 

  

10.6 Limitations on Purchasers Indemnification Liability. 

    

 (a) _Ceiling_ : Purchasers aggregate liability for indemnification claims under this _Article 10_ arising from breaches of representations and warranties in  _Article 5_ shall not exceed the Cap. 

   

 (b) _Deductible_ : Purchaser shall have no liability for indemnification claims under _Article 10_ arising from breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and/or agreements hereunder by Purchaser, unless and until the aggregate Losses claimed under _Article 10_ exceed the Deductible, and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible. 

   

 (c) _Exceptions to the Cap and Deductible._ The limitations in subsections (a) and (b) above of this _Section 10.6_ shall not apply to (i) breaches of _Section 5.2_ (first and second sentences only), (ii) any failure of Purchaser to close and pay the Purchase Price as required hereunder (including any post-closing purchase price adjustment required to be made by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_), (iii) breaches of _Section 6.14_ hereof, (iv) any claims under the Transition Services Agreement, (v) any claims of Seller or GEC pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 10.3_ , and (vi) the obligation of Purchaser to pay fees or expenses as set forth in  _Section 8.6_ and the last sentence of _Section 6.6_. 

  

10.7 Determination of Losses. 

   

 The parties shall take into account any net Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party as of the time that the indemnity payment is made as a result of the incurrence of Losses giving rise to indemnity. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the parties shall take account of any Tax costs to the Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment and the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Losses. In addition, the amount of Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party hereunder will be determined net of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party under any policies of insurance covering the Loss giving rise to the applicable claim. The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make an insurance claim under any relevant policies of insurance covering the loss but shall not be obligated to institute legal proceedings to enforce 

    ##### 

  

    

coverage of any such claim. Furthermore, any amounts received pursuant to
making an insurance claim shall be offset by any Loss related to making such
claim, including the payment of any deductible and any increases in premium
payments that can be shown to be directly attributable to having made
such claim, and the Loss shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which
the Losses related to making such claim exceed the insurance proceeding
actually received. 

   

 10.8 Exclusive Remedy. 

   

 In the event the Closing occurs, Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnification provisions in this _Article 10_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Purchaser (and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties) and Seller (and the other Seller Indemnified Parties) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than for specific performance of this Agreement, which shall be available as a remedy as set forth herein). Except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 10.8_, each party to this Agreement hereby waives all statutory, common Law and other claims with respect to this Agreement, other than claims for indemnification with respect to this Agreement pursuant to (and in accordance with the terms of) this _Article 10_ and other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Seller or Purchaser be liable for any special or punitive damages or consequential damages, except to the extent such damages are payable with respect to a Third-Party Claim, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover or seek any remedy under this Agreement (a) with respect to any claim or liability to any employee employed by a Company or any of their Subsidiaries arising as a result of the termination of such employees employment after the Closing Date (except to the extent arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller hereunder relating to severance or other payments or obligations in connection with such termination) or (b) to the extent that the liability for such damages is included in the calculation of the Closing Date RQ Working Capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies if and to the extent such rights, claims, causes of actions or remedies are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

   

 10.9 Indemnification Obligations of Seller. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, at and after such time that GEC or an Affiliate thereof has sold Seller to a third party, whether by stock purchase, merger, sale of substantially all of its assets or similar business combination transaction, Seller shall not have any indemnification obligation hereunder to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (except in the event of any breach by Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries of _Section 6.13_ or _Section 6.14_, in which case Seller will have indemnification obligations to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in accordance with the terms set forth herein with respect to such breaches).
