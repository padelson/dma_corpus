Closing as set forth in _Section 3.1(b) _, and shall be subject to
adjustment pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.1_ (as so adjusted, the

Amount as shown on the Estimated Statement is less than the Target Unbilled

Adjustment Statement, Seller will be deemed to have accepted and agreed with
the Adjustment Statement. Purchaser shall provide Seller with access
to purchase orders and other

  



  

18

believes should be made, which Objection must be delivered to Purchaser on or

review and respond to the Objection.

  

### 

  

### (g) To the extent that the Adjustment Statement reflects a different
amount from the Estimated Closing Working Capital, estimated Assumed
Indebtedness and estimated Unbilled Reimbursable Tooling Inventory,

the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased

shall be decreased by the amount of such difference;

Amount, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such
difference.

Purchase Price, Seller shall promptly make payment in immediately available
funds to Seller of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, in each case
together with interest on such Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at a per annum rate equal to the JP
Morgan Chase prime rate.

  



  

### (h) The Parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with
respect to any matters in dispute. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement with respect to the Closing within 30 days following the delivery
of Purchasers response to an

acceptable to both parties or, in the absence of agreement, by an accounting
firm of national reputation selected by lot after eliminating Sellers and
Purchasers principal outside accountants. The selected accounting firm shall
be directed by the Parties to use its best efforts to render its
determination within 30-days after such submission. The determination by the

accounting firm in acting under this _Section 3.1_ shall be shared equally
by Purchaser and Seller.

 **EMPLOYEE MATTERS**

  



  

6.1 _Employee Benefit Plans Assets and Liabilities_.

  



  

Subject to any more specific requirements of _Section 6.2_ of this
Agreement, Seller will cause all of the assets and Liabilities associated
with any Employee Benefit Plan, to the extent that it benefits U.S. employees
of the Automotive Business hired by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.2(a)_ of this Agreement or employees of the Acquired Subsidiaries, to be
transferred to and assumed by Purchaser, except that Seller will retain all
of the assets and Liabilities associated with the following: (i) any Employee
Benefit Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan maintained within the

the extent that it benefits any (A) former U.S. employees of the Automotive
Business as of the Closing Date and (B) active U.S. employees of the
Automotive Business who, as of the Closing Date, are not subject to a
collective bargaining agreement.

  



  

6.2 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

### (a) Purchaser shall offer employment to all of the U.S. employees of the
Automotive Business as of the Closing Date, and, except as required pursuant
to any Collective Bargaining Agreement, at compensation rates and with
employee benefits comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those in place as of
the Closing, for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date.  Such hired
employees are hereinafter referred to as "Transferred Employees." If an
employee who is offered employment by Purchaser rejects such an offer, Seller
shall be responsible for satisfying any severance obligations and any
obligations under COBRA. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this _Section
6.2(a)_, Seller agrees that the determination of "comparable employee
benefits" shall not take into account any stock option, equity incentive or
retiree medical plans in place as of the date hereof. Such determination will
take into account the Sellers proposal, as of the date hereof, to change
the copayment arrangements under its medical, prescription and dental plans,
and normal rate adjustments to reflect medical inflation.

  

### 

  

### (b) In accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement,
for a period of six months after the Closing Date (or for a shorter period of
time if desired by Purchaser), each Transferred Employee may continue to
participate, at Purchasers cost, in health and welfare plans not already
administered by the Automotive Business of the Seller in which he or she
participated immediately before the Closing Date. In addition, pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall assist Purchaser with the
transition to new agreements with vendors.

prior to the Closing for purposes of vacation, other paid time off, severance
pay, welfare benefits, vesting eligibility for early retirement under
Purchasers retirement plans and any other purposes for which an employees
service may be relevant, and (ii) payments made toward welfare plan annual
deductible limits and the like. Purchaser shall waive or cause to be
waived under its welfare benefit plans any applicable waiting periods for
coverage of any employees of the Automotive Business and their dependents
that did not exist under Sellers welfare benefit plans, including post-
retirement medical plans with respect to such employees or their dependents
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall also waive or cause
to be waived under its welfare benefit plans any exclusion or limitation with
respect to any pre-existing condition of any employee of the Automotive
Business or their dependents that did not apply under Sellers
welfare benefit plans with respect to such employee or dependent immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Plan year 2004 deferrals and reimbursements by or
to employees under any of Sellers flexible benefit plans shall be carried
over and applied to such employees accounts under Purchasers flexible
benefit plans.  Seller shall transfer to Purchaser assets under Sellers
flexible benefit plans equal to plan year 2004 deductions less
reimbursements.

  

### 

  

### (d) Liability for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims under any self-
insured Employee Benefit Plan shall be transferred by an accrual as a current
liability in the Closing Working Capital.

  

### 

  

### (e) Purchaser shall implement a severance plan (" _Purchaser s Severance
Plan_") that shall provide benefits to any Transferred Employee and any
employee of GDX Automotive, Inc. whose employment is involuntarily terminated
without cause, equal to the benefits such employee would have received under
the applicable Seller Partys severance plan (" _Seller s Severance Plan_")
that applied to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Purchasers Severance Plan shall remain in force for at least 12 months
following the Closing Date, provided, however, that the plan and the benefits
it provides may be modified, reduced or eliminated pursuant to good faith
bargaining with works councils or other employee representatives.

  

### 

  

### (f) Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and hold it harmless from and
against any claims made for severance pay or allowance, termination pay or
allowance or pay in lieu of notice (including government-mandated separation
benefits) arising out of any action by Purchaser with respect to the
employment of any Transferred Employee or employee of an Acquired Subsidiary
after the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (g) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and succeed to all of
the obligations of Seller under the collective bargaining agreements listed
on _Schedule 6.2(g)_ (the " _Collective Bargaining Agreements_ ").
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and notwithstanding
any renegotiation, upon expiration or otherwise, of any such Collective
Bargaining Agreement, Purchaser shall provide, and shall cause any U.S.
Acquired Subsidiaries to provide, at its and their expense, to any eligible
Transferred Employee of the Automotive Business or any employee of a U.S.
Acquired Subsidiary, other than a Transferred Employee or employee of a U.S.

cost maintenance obligations incurred pursuant to Section 420 of the Code)
and collective bargaining agreements.

  

### 

  

### (h) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall establish or amend its
tax-qualified, defined contribution plan (" _Purchaser s Defined
Contribution Plan_"), to provide for participation by the Transferred
Employees immediately following the Closing Date. Purchasers
Defined Contribution Plan shall take into account for purposes of eligibility
and vesting each Transferred Employees service with Seller.

### (i) Upon Closing, Seller shall fully vest all Transferred Employees
account balances under Sellers defined contribution plan (" _Seller s
Defined Contribution Plan_"). All Transferred Employees shall be entitled to
either (i) a distribution of their vested account balances under Sellers
Defined Contribution Plan in accordance with its terms, (ii) maintain such
accounts in Sellers Defined Contribution Plan in accordance with its terms,
or (iii) transfer their respective account balances (including any unpaid
participant loans in such accounts) directly to Purchasers
Defined Contribution Plan. If any Transferred Employee elects to transfer
his or her account balance to Purchasers Defined Contribution Plan, then
Seller shall cause the trustee of Sellers Defined Contribution Plan to
transfer to the trustee or other funding agent of Purchasers Defined
Contribution Plan the assets allocated to the accounts of such employee under
Sellers Defined Contribution Plan. Each such transfer shall comply
with Section 414(1) of the Code and the requirements of ERISA and
the regulations promulgated thereunder.  Further, no transfer shall be made
unless and until Seller and Purchaser each provide each other with a current
favorable determination letter from the IRS, or an opinion of counsel, as to
the qualification of its respective plan.

  

### 

  

### (j) Upon completion of the transfer of assets described in _Section
6.2(i)_, Purchasers Defined Contribution Plan shall assume the benefit
liabilities under Sellers Defined Contribution Plans with respect to those
Transferred Employees who have elected to transfer their account hereunder,
and neither Seller nor Sellers Defined Contribution Plans shall have any
further obligation or responsibility with respect to such liabilities, which
shall be considered for all purposes as having been satisfied as a result of
such transfer.

  

### 

  

### (k) Pension

  

### 

  

#### (i) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, Seller shall cause the
GenCorp Consolidated Pension Plan ("Sellers Pension Plan") to be amended and
will take such other action necessary to provide for the spin-off of all
liabilities, and related assets, attributable to all active U.S. employees of
the Automotive Business as of such date to a separate qualified defined
benefit pension plan sponsored by Seller (the

  



  

42      
   



  

#### "GDX Plan").  Such spin-off will be made in accordance with Code section
414(l) based on updated census data as of the date of this Agreement, and the
amount of assets to be transferred in connection therewith (the "Transferred
Asset Amount") will be determined using actuarial assumptions and methods
considered by Sellers actuary to be reasonable under Code section 414(l) as
of the date of this Agreement, provided that if such amount is less than (i)
the projected benefit obligation with respect to active U.S. employees of
the Automotive Business as of the date of this Agreement ("PBO"), plus
(ii) $7,000,000, Seller shall transfer the difference from sources other
than Sellers Pension Plan, first to the GDX Plan if a tax deductible
contribution is permitted prior to Closing and, to the extent a tax
deductible contribution is not permitted, then by cash payment to Purchaser
(the "Pension Adjustment Payment").  For purposes of this Section 6.2(k),
Seller covenants and agrees that the PBO will be determined in accordance
with GAAP in a manner consistent with the manner in which it is determined
for purposes of Sellers financial statements, including use of a 6½ %
discount factor, which was the manner used for the determination of
the indicative estimate of a PBO of $50 million provided to Purchaser during
the course of negotiations between the Parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The GDX Plan will be substantively identical to Sellers Pension
Plan as amended pursuant to the favorable Determination Letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service on June 3, 2004 and as in effect immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement; provided that Purchaser may amend, modify or
terminate the GDX Plan after its assumption of such GDX Plan, subject to the
terms of the GDX Plan, the terms of this Agreement, any applicable collective
bargaining agreement and applicable law.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The assets of Sellers Pension Plan to be transferred to the GDX
Plan shall be in the form of assets which mirror the investment portfolio of
Sellers Pension Plan. Seller shall transfer 90% of the Transferred Asset
Amount from Sellers Pension Plan to the GDX Plan when it is determined by
Sellers actuary in accordance with Section 6.2(k)(i) (the "Determination")
no later than 90 days after the date of this Agreement, and no less than 30
days after Seller has filed a Form 5310-A with the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to such transfer; provided that Seller shall file such Form
5310-A within 30 days of the date of this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Beginning on the date of this Agreement and for the entire period
that the assets attributable to the GDX Plan remain in the GenCorp Master
Retirement Trust, (i) the GDX Plan will be responsible for the payment of all
benefits due thereunder, and (ii) the GDX Plan will share the same investment
experience (positive or negative) as Sellers Pension Plan, and will bear its
appropriate share of administrative and investment-related expenses.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Effective as of the later of (A) the initial transfer of assets from
Sellers Pension Plan in accordance with Section 6.2(k)(iii) or (B) the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume the GDX Plan and Seller and Purchaser
shall cooperate to effect the transition of administrative functions and to
transfer GDX Plan assets to an appropriate trustee designated by Purchaser.

  



  

43      
   



  

#### (vi) Sellers actuary shall promptly deliver a copy of its Determination
to Purchaser, together with such supporting information as is reasonably
necessary to permit Purchasers enrolled actuary to verify Sellers actuarys
calculations.

  

#### 

  

##### (A) Within 45 days after Purchaser receives the Determination and
supporting information described in Section 6.2(k)(vi), Purchaser may
identify any material errors or issues in the Determination.  The
Determination will be conclusive and binding on the parties unless Purchaser,
within the 45-day period after the delivery of the Determination, notifies
Seller in writing that it disputes the calculation, specifying the nature of
the dispute and the basis therefore (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Sellers
actuary shall attempt to resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable.

  

##### 

  

##### (B) Enrolled actuaries retained by each of Purchaser and Seller shall
attempt in good faith to reach agreement to resolve all of the disputes set
forth in the Dispute Notice within 45 days after the Dispute Notice is given
to Seller by Purchaser. If the disparity between the two is less than 1% of
the Transferred Asset Amount as indicated in the Determination, the
determination of Sellers actuary with respect to the Determination shall be
conclusive. If the differential is more than 1%, the dispute with respect to
the Determination shall be resolved as set forth under subparagraphs (1) and
(2) below.

  

##### 

  

###### (1) Purchaser and Seller shall jointly select a third, impartial
actuary from a nationally recognized actuarial firm to resolve the disputes.
If the parties cannot jointly select a third, impartial actuary within 15
days after the end of such 90-day period, the President of the Conference of
Consulting Actuaries shall select an impartial actuary. The cost of the
impartial actuary shall be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser.

  

###### 

  

###### (2) Promptly, but no later than 90 days after his or her selection,
the impartial actuary shall review the results of the calculation, the
supporting information with respect to the Determination and the Dispute
Notice and shall reach his or her own decision as to the issues in dispute
and the determination of the Transferred Asset Amount (which determination
shall be equal to or between the respective amounts asserted by Purchaser and
Seller). Such determination shall be final and conclusive for all purposes.

  

###### 

  

##### (C) No later than 45 days following the final determination of the
Transferred Asset Amount under this Section 6.2(k)(vi), Seller shall cause a
transfer of assets from Sellers Pension Plan to the GDX Plan equal to the
amount, if any, by which the Transferred Asset Amount exceeds the initial
transfer that was made from Sellers Pension Plan to the GDX Plan. Purchaser

  

##### 

  

##### 44      
   

##### 

  

##### shall cause a transfer of assets from the GDX Plan to Sellers Pension
Plan equal to the amount, if any, by which the initial transfer that was made
to the GDX Plan exceeded the Transferred Asset Amount. Any Pension
Adjustment Payment required to be made by Seller pursuant to Section
6.2(k)(i) shall also be made at that time. In addition, if the Transferred
Asset Amount is greater than the sum of PBO and $7,000,000, then Purchaser
shall at the same time make a cash payment to Seller in the amount by which
the Transferred Asset Amount exceeds such sum.

  

##### 

  

##### (D) In addition, Purchaser may identify any material issues or errors
relating to the allocation of plan expenses and the investment portfolio not
complying with Section 6.2(k)(iii) in the same manner as provided in
this Section 6.2(k)(vi).

  

##### 

  

#### (vii) If Closing occurs prior to the end of the first plan year for the
GDX Plan on November 30, 2004, Purchaser will have responsibility for year-
end audits and filings, such as Form 5500. Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser with such information regarding the GDX Plan as may be
reasonably requested and necessary to administer and maintain the GDX Plan
and to perform all year-end audits and make all necessary filings.

  

#### 

  

#### (viii) Seller will apply for an IRS Determination Letter for the GDX
Plan prior to Closing.

  

#### 

  

### (l) Seller shall be responsible for providing notice to the PBGC of any
reportable event, within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, that occurs
pursuant to this Agreement and the Transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

9.2 _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Reporting Consistent_.

  



  

### (a) _Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_. Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser and each Acquired Subsidiary with respect to any and all
Taxes that may be imposed on Purchaser or any Acquired Subsidiary or
in respect of the Automotive Business (A) with respect to any Taxable period
of any Acquired Subsidiary or any Affiliated Group ending on or prior to
the Closing Date or allocated to Seller pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this
_Section 9.2_ relating to Straddle Periods (1) in the case of any Foreign
Excluded Taxes and (2) in the case of any other Tax in excess of the amounts
accrued with respect to such Tax in Closing Working Capital, (B) to the
extent such Taxes arise as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation contained in Section 5.12 and not otherwise indemnified under
any other section of this Agreement, (C) under Section 1.1502-6 of the U.S.
Treasury regulations or any comparable state, local or foreign Tax provision
governing the liability for Tax of the members of a Tax group or (D) which
result from or would not have been imposed but for any action contemplated
in Schedule 8.2(x). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will not be liable
to Purchaser for any usage or reduction of net operating losses (" _NOLs_ "),
tax credits or other tax attributes of any Acquired Subsidiary which
otherwise would have been available to Purchaser or an Acquired Subsidiary as
a result of any tax audit relating to (i) any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Taxable Period") or (ii) any Straddle
Period for which Seller would be responsible pursuant to Section 9.2(c)
hereunder or other actions of Seller before or after the Closing Date
relating to any Taxes arising in a Pre-Closing Taxable Period provided the
NOLs available to Purchaser or the Acquired Subsidiaries in respect of
taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date (including the portion of
any Straddle Period for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to Section 9.2(c)
of this Agreement) are no less than 9,761,605 Euros for GDX Automotive
Rehburg GmbH and Co. KG, 10,832,055 Euros for GenCorp GmbH and 4,406,340 Euros
for GenCorp Beteiligungs GmbH (" _Minimum German NOLs_ "). If actual German
NOLs for any of the three (3) foregoing companies is reduced below the
Minimum German NOL with respect to such company as a result of tax audits
relating to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or tax audits of any Straddle
Periods to the extent Straddle

### 57      
   

### 

  

### Period tax assessments are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to
Section 9.2(c) hereunder or as a result of any action or failure to act by
Seller before or after the Closing Date, Seller will pay to Purchaser the
actual incremental Taxes of Purchaser or any Acquired Subsidiary due to or
resulting from any difference between the actual German NOLs for such German
company listed above and the Minimum German NOL with respect to such company.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Post-Closing Taxable Periods_. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be
paid, and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from, any
Taxes attributable to all Taxable periods of any Acquired Subsidiary ending
after the Closing Date (except to the extent such Taxes are allocated to
Seller pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this _Section 9.2_ relating to
Straddle Periods.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Straddle Periods_. If, for any United States federal, state, local
or foreign Tax purposes, the Taxable period of any Acquired Subsidiary does
not terminate on the Closing Date (any such period, a " _Straddle Period_
"), Taxes, if any, attributable to such Straddle Period shall be allocated to
(A) Seller for the portion of such Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date, except to the extent accrued in Closing Working Capital, and
(B) Purchaser for the portion of such Straddle Period subsequent to the
Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Taxes for the portion
of each Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date and for the
portion of such Straddle Period subsequent to the Closing Date shall be
determined on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date as if such Straddle Period consisted of one
Taxable period ending on the Closing Date followed by a Taxable period
beginning on the day following the Closing Date or under such other
reasonable method as the parties may agree. For purposes of this subparagraph
(c), exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a
daily basis. For purposes of determining consolidated federal income Taxes,
if applicable, items shall be allocated pursuant to (i) Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) of the U.S. Treasury regulations and no election shall be
made under section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) of the U.S. Treasury regulations or
(ii) any comparable state, local or foreign Tax provisions governing the
determination of items included in separate and consolidated Tax Returns.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Seller, at Sellers expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of any Acquired Subsidiary or
any Affiliated Group for all Taxable periods of any Acquired Subsidiary that
end on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser will provide Seller with
appropriate authorizations to file such returns. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which Seller
prepared or filed such Tax Returns for prior periods, except to the extent
that Seller shall have received Purchasers prior written consent which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  Seller shall be responsible for paying amounts
due with respect to such returns, except to the extent accrued in Closing
Working Capital. Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, shall be responsible for
preparing and filing all Tax

  

#### 

  

#### 58      
   

#### 

  

#### Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any Acquired Subsidiary
for Taxable periods ending after the Closing Date including Straddle Period
Tax Returns.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser
pursuant to subparagraph (i) above for a Straddle Period of any Acquired
Subsidiary, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of such completed Tax
Return along with copies of all workpapers setting forth the amount of Tax
shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to Seller (the " _Statement_ ") at
least 30 business days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return provided that with respect to foreign Tax Returns, an accounting firm
acceptable to both the Seller and Purchaser shall review such returns and
prepare the Statement. Not later than 29 business days after receiving the
copy of the return and workpapers, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to the amount of the Taxes shown on the Statement that are allocable to
Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

  

#### 

  

### (e) _Cooperation with Respect to Tax Matters_. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser and Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to the other in
connection with the preparation of Tax Returns of any of the Acquired
Subsidiaries and Tax Returns of any company or companies owning the Acquired
Assets prior to Closing and shall promptly make available to the other and to
any applicable Governmental Authority, as reasonably requested, all
information, records, personnel (during normal business hours) or documents
relating to Tax liabilities or potential Tax liabilities of any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries or Acquired Assets for all periods prior to or
including the Closing Date in order that any audit, assessment, defense or
refund claim relating to such Tax periods may be processed in a timely manner
and shall preserve all such information, records and documents until the
expiration of any statute of limitations or extensions thereof. To the
extent that either Seller or Purchaser fails to comply with this
provision, the defaulting party shall reimburse the other for reasonable
costs incurred in securing the information that was in the possession of the
defaulting party, such costs being those that would not have been incurred
but for such failure.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Tax Audits and Assessments_. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller
in writing upon receipt by Purchaser or any Acquired Subsidiary of written
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment of any Acquired
Subsidiary for any pre-Closing Tax period or for any Straddle Period (each, a
"Tax Claim").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of Purchaser to
give notice under the preceding sentence shall not relieve Seller of any of
its obligations hereunder unless such failure shall preclude the defense of
such claim. In the case of any Tax Claim that can be contested separately
from the contest of any Tax not indemnified under Section 9.2 and as to the
full amount of such claim the relevant member(s) of the Purchaser Group is
indemnified pursuant to such Section 9.2 (a " _Severable Tax Claim_ "), the
Seller may, in its sole discretion, direct Purchaser to either pay the Tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest such Severable Tax Claim in any
permissible forum and shall otherwise have the sole right at its sole expense
to direct, control and settle any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to such Severable Tax Claim (including any competent authority
proceeding); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall be entitled to
participate at its sole expense in such administrative or judicial
proceedings and (ii) to the extent any settlement of any such

### 59      
   

### 

  

### proceeding is reasonably expected to (A) have an adverse impact on the
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax not indemnified by
Seller under Section 9.2 or (B) reduce German NOLs below Minimum German NOL
as defined in Section 9.2(a) for each German Company, Seller must obtain the
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of Purchaser to such settlement. In the case of any
Tax Claim that is not a Severable Tax Claim, (i) if such claim is not a
Severable Tax Claim because it cannot be contested separately from a claim in
respect of a Tax for which the Purchaser is not indemnified under Section 9.2
(a " _Related Claim_ "), Seller shall control the conduct of any
administrative or judicial proceedings (including any competent authority
proceeding) relating to the Tax Claim at its sole expense and Purchaser shall
control the conduct of any Related Claim at its sole expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser and Seller shall consult in good faith on the
proper administrative and judicial forums in which to contest such Tax Claim
and Related Claim, it being understood that in the event of disagreement the
choice of forum shall be decided by the Seller if the amount of the Tax
Claims in such proceedings exceeds the amount of the Related Claims in such
proceedings and otherwise by the Purchaser and (ii) if such Tax Claim is not
a Severable Tax Claim because the full amount of such Tax Claim is not
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
control the contest of such Tax Claim, it being understood that in the case
of disagreement as to the proper action to be taken in connection with any
such contest, the Seller shall decide the proper action if, in the event such
Tax Claim is successful, the amount for which the Purchaser is indemnified
under Section 9.2 would equal or exceed the amount not indemnified under such
section, and the Purchaser shall decide the proper action if, in the event
such Tax Claim is successful, the amount for which the Purchaser is
indemnified under Section 9.2 would not exceed the amount not indemnified
under such section; provided further, that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall
settle any proceeding relating to a Tax Claim that is not a Severable Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of the other which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser and Seller shall
equitably share the cost of any audit or appeal of any matter relating to a
Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (g) To the extent any proceeding in respect of any Tax Claim involves a
competent authority appeal under any Tax treaty, Purchaser acknowledges that
correlative relief may be available only if an Acquired Subsidiary makes a
payment to Seller or one of Sellers subsidiaries or another Acquired
Subsidiary (any such payment by an Acquired Subsidiary, a "Correlative Relief
Payment"). In the event such correlative relief is available only if
an Acquired Subsidiary makes a Correlative Relief Payment, (x) Purchaser
shall cause such Acquired Subsidiary to use reasonable commercial efforts to
make such Correlative Relief Payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
such Acquired Subsidiary is required under applicable law to withhold any Tax
in respect of such Correlative Relief Payment, such Acquired Subsidiary
shall withhold such Tax, shall pay over the amount of such Tax to the
applicable Governmental Authority and shall deliver to Seller a receipt for
such withheld Tax (or, if a receipt is not issued by such Governmental
Authority, such other evidence of payment of such Tax as is available to such
Acquired Subsidiary and reasonably acceptable to Seller), (y) Seller shall
pay to Purchaser, or the Acquired Subsidiary making such Correlative Relief
Payment, an amount equal to the full amount of such Correlative Relief
Payment received by Seller

  

### 

  

### 60      
   

### 

  

### ( _i.e._ , the amount of the Correlative Relief Payment without reduction
for any Tax required to be withheld by the Acquired Subsidiary) and (z)
Purchaser and Seller shall treat the amount paid by Seller to Purchaser, or
the Acquired Subsidiary making such Correlative Relief Payment, pursuant to
the preceding clause (y) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. If any
Acquired Subsidiary is entitled to any item of loss, deduction or credit as a
result of making a Correlative Relief Payment and any such item results in a
refund in respect of such Acquired Subsidiarys Tax liability with respect to
a taxable period that ended on or prior to the Closing Date, such Acquired
Subsidiary shall pay to Seller the amount of such Tax refund promptly after
receipt thereof. During the Straddle Period, Purchaser shall cause the
taxable year of GenCorp Canada, Inc. to terminate for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Prior to such termination, Purchaser shall not take any action
outside the ordinary course of business, such as dividends, reorganizations
or restructurings, that will materially affect Sellers or GenCorp Canada,
Inc.s Earnings and Profits in Canada, other than the incurrence of debt, and
no section 338 or 338(h)(10) elections will be filed by Purchaser.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9.2(g), Purchaser shall
not take any action with respect to GenCorp Canada, Inc. that could adversely
affect the amount of U.S. or Canadian Taxes for which Seller is responsible
under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Wage Reporting_. Seller and Purchaser agree to utilize the alternate
procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure 96-60 with respect to wage reporting
in respect of the Transferred Employees.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Tax Refunds_. If after the Closing Date Purchaser, or any Acquired
Subsidiary or an affiliate of Purchaser receives any refund of Taxes for
which Seller has indemnified under this Agreement or would have received
a refund but for such refund being used as a credit or other offset against
Taxes not indemnified by Seller under this Agreement (each, a "deemed
refund"), Purchaser, the applicable Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser
affiliate shall promptly notify Seller of receipt of such refund and shall
promptly thereafter transfer the funds from that refund or deemed refund to
Seller or an affiliate designated by Seller provided that if any Tax is
imposed on such refund or deemed refund, the Purchaser, the applicable
Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser affiliate is hereby authorized to withhold
any such Tax and such Tax shall reduce the amount otherwise transferable to
Seller or its affiliate. The amount of any such Tax withheld shall be treated
as transferred to Seller or its affiliate at the time it is withheld and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority. If there is a possibility
that such a withholding Tax is payable, the Purchaser, the applicable
Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser affiliate may in its reasonable discretion
withhold such amounts in accordance with this _Section 9.2(i)_. If the
Seller or its affiliate wishes to apply for a refund of any such Tax, the
Purchaser, the applicable Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser affiliate shall
reasonably cooperate with the Seller or its affiliate in making such claim,
so long as the Seller or its affiliate agrees to reimburse the Purchaser, the
applicable Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser affiliate for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred. The Purchaser, the applicable Acquired Subsidiary or
Purchaser affiliate shall give the Seller or its affiliate notice of any such
Tax to be withheld.

  

### 

  

### 61      
   

### 

  

### (j) _Laird Payments_. If after Closing, Purchaser or any
Acquired Subsidiary or Purchaser affiliate receives any payment or payments
under the Tax Deed dated 29 December 2000 between Laird Inc. and Others as
defined in said agreement and GenCorp Inc. and Others as defined in such
agreement (" _Laird Payments_ "), Seller will be notified promptly of such
receipt and (i) if the Laird Payments are for amounts for which Seller is
required to indemnify Purchaser under section 9.2(a) above but Seller has not
paid such amounts to Purchaser, then Purchaser will apply and credit such
Laird Payments to amounts owed by Seller and promptly advise Seller of such
actions and (ii) if the Laird Payments are for amounts not owed by Seller to
Purchaser due to the prior payment of such amounts by Seller to Purchaser or
for any other reason, then Purchaser will promptly transfer such amounts to
Seller. Further, Purchaser or any Acquired Subsidiary must obtain the prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of Seller before Purchaser or any Acquired Subsidiary makes any
claim under the above described tax deed.

  

### 

  

9.3 _No Further Investigation_.

  



  

On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its
affiliates (including but not limited to the Acquired Subsidiaries, and their
respective successors and assigns), agree not to, and agree not to enter into
any agreement that would permit their respective successors or assigns to,
take any voluntary action, including any sampling of the soil or groundwater,
or to initiate or encourage any action by any third party, including any
Governmental Authority or third party, which could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Environmental Claim by such Governmental Authority or third party
under any Environmental Law, (collectively " _Voluntary Environmental Action_
"); provided however that Voluntary Environmental Action shall not include:
(i) any acts required by, or that are otherwise reasonably necessary in order
to comply with Law, including any Environmental Law, or any Contract or Real

consideration, at Sellers expense, the equipment and customer and supplier
Contracts of Snappon. Seller shall indemnify Purchaser against any costs,
claims, damages, penalties, compensation awards or expenses incurred by

affiliate (i) resulting from a call on any such obligation prior to such
removal or replacement of Seller or such affiliate, as applicable, or (ii)
arising out of any default by Purchaser in the performance of the obligations
contained in this _Section 9.6_. The indemnification of Seller under this
_Section 9.6_ will be governed by the indemnification provisions set forth
in _ARTICLE XII_ hereto. The obligation contained in this Section 9.6 shall
extend to the guarantee referenced in Section 2.5(ix) hereof, provided that
the replacement of Seller as a guarantor shall not change the status of the
obligation referenced in Section 2.5(ix) as an Excluded Liability.

Schedules may become necessary as a result of the conduct of the
Automotive Business in the normal course; provided, however, that no such

12.1 _Indemnity Obligations of Seller_.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ and _Sections 8.3(d)_ and
_9.2_ , from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify and hold
Purchaser and its subsidiaries and affiliates (including the Acquired
Subsidiaries) and all directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and
representatives of Purchaser and its subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Subsidiaries) (the " _Purchaser Group_ ")) harmless from, and reimburse the
Purchaser Group for, any Purchaser Indemnity Claim. The term "
_Purchaser Indemnity Claim_ " shall mean any loss, damage, deficiency, claim,
liability, obligation, suit, action, fee, penalty, cost or expense of any
nature whatsoever, including costs of defense, investigation and settlement,
resulting from (i) any breach of any representation and warranty of Seller
which is contained in any Transaction Document (other than the
representations contained in _Section 5.17_), or any Schedule or certificate
delivered pursuant thereto; (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of, or any
failure to perform, any of the covenants, agreements or undertakings of
Seller or its affiliates which are contained in any Transaction Document; any
failure to comply with all applicable laws related to environmental
liability associated with the transfer of businesses or assets, or related to
notices to or consultation with employee representative bodies in connection
with the Transaction; (iii) any Excluded Assets; and (iv) any Excluded
Liabilities.

  



  

12.2 _Indemnity Obligations of Purchaser_.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ and _Sections 8.3(d)_ ,
_9.2_ and _9.6_ , from and after the Closing Date Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold Seller and its subsidiaries and all directors, officers, partners,
employees, agents, affiliates and representatives of Seller and its
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Seller Group") harmless from, and reimburse
the Indemnified Seller Group for, any Seller Indemnity Claims. The term "
_Seller Indemnity Claim_ " shall mean any loss, damage, deficiency, claim,
liability, suit, action, fee, penalty, cost or expense of any nature
whatsoever, including costs of defense, investigation or settlement, incurred
by Seller resulting from (i) any breach of any representation and warranty of
Purchaser and any Designated Affiliate which is contained in any Transaction
Document or any Schedule or certificate delivered pursuant thereto; (ii) any
breach or non-fulfillment of, or failure to perform, any of the covenants,
agreements or undertakings of Purchaser or its affiliates which are contained
in any Transaction Document; (iii) any Acquired Assets; and (iv) any
Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

12.3 _Notification of Claims_.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ and _Sections 8.3(d)_ and
_9.2_ , in the event of the occurrence of an event which any party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") asserts constitutes a Purchaser Indemnity Claim or a
Seller Indemnity Claim, as applicable, such party shall provide

  



  

67      
   



  

the indemnifying party with prompt notice of such event and shall otherwise
make available to the indemnifying party all relevant information which is
material to the claim, including information with respect to the availability
of insurance coverage, and which is in the possession of the Indemnified
Party. If such event involves the claim of any third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the indemnifying party shall have the right to elect to join in
the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such Third Party
Claim, and to employ counsel to assist such Indemnified Party in connection
with the handling of such claim, at the sole expense of the indemnifying
party, and no such claim shall be settled, adjusted or compromised, or the
defense thereof terminated, without the prior consent of the indemnifying
party unless and until the indemnifying party shall have failed, after the
lapse of a reasonable period of time, but in no event more than 30 days after
written notice to it of the Third Party Claim, to join in and thereafter
diligently pursue the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of the
same. Upon receipt of written notice of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than 15 days prior to
the date a response or answer thereto is due (unless a response or answer is
due within fewer than 15 days from the date the Indemnified Party received
notice thereof and then so long as reasonably possible prior to the due date
thereof), inform the indemnifying party in writing thereof. An Indemnified
Partys failure to give timely notice as provided above or to furnish the
indemnifying party with any relevant data and documents in connection with
any Third Party Claim shall not constitute a defense (in part or in whole) to
any claim for indemnification by such party, except and only to the extent
that such failure shall result in any material prejudice to the indemnifying
party. Any indemnifying party may elect, at such partys sole expense, to
assume control of the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of any
Third Party Claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to each Indemnified
Party, insofar as such claim relates to the liability of the indemnifying
party, provided that such indemnifying party shall obtain the consent of all
Indemnified Parties (which consent shall be deemed given if any request for
consent is not responded to within ten business days) before entering into
any settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claims, or ceasing to defend
against such claims, if as a result thereof, or pursuant thereto, (i) there
would be imposed on an Indemnified Party any liability or obligation not
covered by the indemnity obligations of the indemnifying parties under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any injunctive relief or other
remedy), (ii) any Indemnified Party would be required to admit any liability
on the part of such Indemnified Party or (iii) the Indemnified Parties would
not receive an unconditional release of all applicable indemnified claims. In
connection with any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party, or the
indemnifying party if it has assumed the defense of such claim pursuant to
the preceding sentence, shall diligently pursue the defense of such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the indemnifying
party in connection with such claim, make available personnel, witnesses,
books and records relevant thereto and grant such authorizations to the
agents, representatives and counsel of the indemnifying party as the
indemnifying party may request.

  



  

12.4 _Survival_.

  



  

All representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to the
Transaction Documents, and the rights of the Parties to seek indemnification
with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing and shall expire 24 months
after Closing Date, except that the representation contained in _Sections
5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.4_ , _5.5,_ _5.12_  and _5.20(e)_ hereof and the
right of Purchaser to seek indemnification with respect thereto shall survive
indefinitely, and the

  



  

68      
   



  

representations contained in _Sections 5.13_ , _5.17_ ,  _5.23_ and _5.24_
hereto and the right of Purchaser to seek indemnification with respect
thereto shall survive until the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to the matters described therein (including extensions thereof).
For purposes of clarity, the obligations of Seller to indemnify the Purchaser
Group for Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities (including those Excluded
Liabilities specified in _Section 2.5(vi)_) shall be without limitation as
to amount or duration.

  



  

12.5 _Limitations_.

  



  

### (a) Following the Closing Date, Seller will not have liability under
clause (i) of _Section 12.1_ and Purchaser will not have any liability under
clause (i) of _Section 12.2_, until the aggregate amount of liability
actually incurred by the indemnified party with respect to all Purchaser
Indemnity Claims or Seller Indemnity Claims made under such provisions, as
the case may be, exceeds 1% of Purchase Price (the " _Basket_ "), in which
event, the indemnifying party will be required to pay the entire amount of
such Purchaser Indemnity Claims or Seller Indemnity Claims in excess of the
Basket. In addition to the foregoing, the maximum aggregate amount for which
indemnification under _Sections 12.1(i)_ or _12.2(i)_ may be sought will be
20% of Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers indemnification obligations with respect to Environmental
Liabilities shall be limited as follows:

  

### 

  

#### (i) With respect to Shared Environmental Liabilities, Sellers
indemnification liability for each individual Environmental Claim shall be
limited to the product of (i) the aggregate Environmental Liability
associated with such Environmental Claim and (ii) the percentage set forth
under the heading "Sellers Share" on _Schedule 12.5(b)_ hereto that
corresponds to the time that such Environmental Claim is made. In addition to
the foregoing, the maximum aggregate amount for which indemnification may be
sought against Seller with respect to Shared Environmental Liabilities will
be the difference between (A) 20% of Purchase Price and (B) any amounts paid
by Seller as a result of liability under clause (i) of _Section 12.1_.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If Seller has any obligation to indemnify Purchaser for any
Environmental Liability and such indemnity relates to any Remedial Action,
then Sellers obligations shall be limited to indemnification of Remedial
Action only to standards no more restrictive than those applicable to the use
of the applicable property as of the date hereof, regardless of the standard
required for the intended use of the property.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Purchaser for capital
expenditures to the extent such capital expenditures are included in the
Automotive Businesss capital expenditure plan as set forth in _Schedule
12.5(b)(iii)_.

  

#### 

  

### (c) In the event that Seller has the obligation to indemnify Purchaser
with respect to any Environmental Claims arising out of Environmental
Liabilities for which the Seller is obligated to pay 70% or more of the cost
of the Environmental Claim pursuant to  _Schedule 12.5(b)_, Seller will be
deemed the "Managing Party" and Purchaser will be deemed the "Non-Managing
Party" with respect to any proceedings and/or remediation related to such
Environmental Claim. In the event that Sellers obligation to

  

### 

  

### 69      
   

### 

  

### indemnify the Purchaser for such Environmental Claims is less than 50%,
Purchaser will be deemed the Managing Party and Seller will be deemed the
Non-Managing Party with respect to any proceedings and/or remediation related
to such Environmental Claim. In the event that the share of both Seller and
Purchaser is 50%, both Seller and Purchaser will be deemed to be Managing
Parties with joint control for undertaking all response and Remedial Action
necessary to address the Environmental Claim. In the event of a dispute the
provisions of Section 12.5(d) will apply. Notwithstanding anything stated
above, and irrespective of Sellers Share unless Sellers Share is 100%,
where the Environmental Claim involves an adversarial issue or proceeding
involving the retention of counsel, the provisions of _Section 12.3_ as to
control of the matter will apply.

  

### 

  

The Managing Party shall be obligated to undertake all response and Remedial
Action necessary to address the Environmental Claim. The Managing Party agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid unreasonable interference
with the operation of the Automotive Business.  The Managing Party will use
commercially acceptable efforts to use employees of the Automotive Business
to conduct Remedial Action where such is reasonably practical. The
Managing Party will cooperate with and allow the Non-Managing Party to
observe and reasonably participate in its conduct of the response to the
Environmental Claim. "Reasonable Participation" shall be broadly construed,
and shall include, by way of example and not limitation, being given
reasonably advance notice for conduct of investigations in response to
Environmental Claims and participating in site conferences with site contact.
Any plans for Remedial Action ("Remedial Action Plans"), Phase I and Phase II
studies, will be subject to the approval of the Non-Managing Party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

### (d) _Dispute Resolution with Respect to Disputes Arising Under Section
12.5(b)(iii)_. Within ten business days of the applicable dispute, the Seller
and Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify an
environmental consultant, who will be jointly accepted by Seller and
Purchaser, to resolve any disputes arising under _Section 12.5(b)(iii)_ (the
" _Dispute Resolution Consultant_ ").  In the event the Dispute Resolution
Consultant leaves the employ of the firm he/she is listed with at the time of
this Agreement or decides to terminate services as the Dispute Resolution
Consultant, or in the event the parties desire to change the Dispute
Resolution Consultant, Seller and Purchaser, upon mutual written consent
shall change the Dispute Resolution Consultant. Unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties in writing, the replacement Dispute Resolution Consultant
shall not have worked for the Seller or Purchaser in the preceding twenty-
four month period.

  

### 

  

In the event a dispute arises as to the actions to be taken in response to an
Environmental Claim pursuant to _Section 12.5(b)(iii)_ (a "Response Action
Dispute"), either Party may give notice to the other Party in writing of its
intention to resort to the Dispute Resolution Consultant. (In the event a
dispute arises as to the interpretation of the provisions of these sections,
the dispute shall be handled in accordance with the dispute resolution
provisions governing the remainder of this Agreement).  The Parties shall
jointly communicate the nature of the Response Action Dispute to the Dispute
Resolution Consultant by telephone, and the Response Action Dispute will be
resolved as expeditiously as possible by the Dispute Resolution Consultant or
its designee.  The Dispute Resolution Consultant may, at its discretion,
request a

  



  

70      
   



  

written description of the Response Action Dispute, in which case the Party
bringing the Response Action Dispute will have five days to submit a written
description of the Response Action Dispute and the opposing Party will have
five days to submit a written response, unless the Parties agree to a
modified schedule.

  



  

The Parties agree to be bound by the decision of the Dispute Resolution
Consultant. The Dispute Resolution Consultant shall issue to the Parties a
written "Dispute Resolution Letter" identifying each of the disputed issues
and stating his/her decision or determination. The parties shall have five
days to present comments in response to the Dispute Resolution Letter. The
Dispute Resolution Consultant may, at its discretion, accept or reject those
comments and revise the Dispute Resolution Letter accordingly.  Costs and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Consultant shall be divided equally
between Seller and Purchaser.

  



  

### (e) Seller shall have no liability under this _ARTICLE XII_ for any
Purchaser Indemnity Claim to the extent arising out of or in connection with
any action (whether the taking of soil or groundwater samples or otherwise)
prohibited by _Section 9.3_, whether by Purchaser or any other person,
including any subsequent owner or operator of any part of the Automotive
Business, any asset or former asset of the Automotive Business, New LLC, any
of the Subsidiaries or any of such Subsidiaries respective subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (f) Except as set forth in  _Section 12.5(a)_ and _12.5(b)_ ,
Purchasers indemnification obligations under _Section 12.2_ shall not be
limited.

  

### 

  

### (g) The amount for which indemnification may be sought for any Purchaser
Indemnity Claim or Seller Indemnity Claim shall be net of any amounts
recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party or an affiliate of the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or otherwise, taking
into account any costs of collection for or increased costs under applicable
insurance policies resulting from such recovery by the Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

### (h) No claims for Indemnification shall include damages not proximately
caused by the breach, or any punitive, special or exemplary damages or any
claim for a multiplier effect or any capitalization of out of pocket expenses
or lost profits. For the avoidance of doubt, damages paid to a third party in
connection with an Indemnification claim or in connection with a breach,
warranty or covenant shall be considered direct damages hereunder, even if
such damages include punitive, special or exemplary damages. No Indemnified
Party shall be indemnified under this _ARTICLE XII_ for any matter to the
extent that such Indemnified Party has been compensated for such matter
pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment contained in _Section 3.1_.

  

### 

  

### (i) The limitations on indemnification contained in Section 12.5 (a)
shall not apply to breaches of representations contained in Section 5.2,
Section 5.12 or Section 7.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no indemnification shall be due to the Purchaser Group
hereunder as a result of any breach of the representations contained in
Section 5.12 to the extent that any Liability resulting from such breach is
included in accruals in the Closing Working Capital.

  

### 

  

### 71      
   

### 

  

### (j) The Parties agree that, except as provided by _Sections 8.3(d)_ and
_9.2,_ following the Closing, the indemnification and other provisions set
forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Purchaser against Seller, on the one hand, and of Seller against Purchaser,
on the other hand, arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein will eliminate the availability to the Parties
of any equitable remedies with respect to any dispute that may arise under
this Agreement or limit any claim based upon fraud.

  

### 

  

### (k) The computation of the amount for which indemnification may be sought
under this _ARTICLE XII_ or under _Section 9.2_ shall take into account any
Tax Benefit and any Tax Cost that results from the event giving rise to the
indemnity claim or the receipt or accrual of any indemnity payment under this
_ARTICLE XII_ or under _Section 9.2_. For purposes of this _Section
12.5(k)_, (A) "Tax Benefit" means, with respect to any claim that results in
an indemnity payment under this _ARTICLE XII_ or under _Section 9.2_, any
item of deduction, loss or credit available to the person making such claim
or any affiliate of such person that results from the event giving rise to
such claim, but only to the extent such item results in a reduction in the
Tax liability of the relevant person or any of its affiliates in the then
current taxable period or in any Tax Return with respect thereto (including
through a carryback to a prior taxable period to the extent such carryback
results in a refund that such person or affiliate is entitled to retain under
the terms of this Agreement) or in any taxable period prior to the date of
the indemnity claim; and (B) "Tax Cost" means, with respect to any claim that
results in any indemnity payment under this _ARTICLE XII_ or _Section 9.2_,
any item of income or gain that results from the receipt or accrual of such
indemnity payment, but only to the extent such item results in a current
increase in the Tax liability of such person. Whether such a reduction or
increase in Tax liability results from any such item of deduction, loss,
credit, income or gain shall be determined by first computing such persons
Tax liability without taking into account such items and second computing
such persons Tax liability taking into account such items, with a decrease
in Tax liability resulting if the first amount is greater than the second and
an increase in Tax liability resulting if the second amount is greater than
the first.
