                              STOCK SALE AGREEMENT


                  Stock Sale  Agreement,  dated as of September 15, 2000, by and
among Arrow Electronics, Inc., a New York corporation, Merisel, Inc., a Delaware
corporation,  and Merisel  Americas,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation and a wholly
owned  subsidiary  of Merisel,  Inc. and the holder of all the capital  stock of
Merisel  Open  Computing  Alliance,   Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation.   Certain
capitalized  terms used in this Agreement have the meanings  assigned to them in
Article IX.

                  WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding Shares
of the Company; and

                  WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of Purchaser,  Parent
and Seller has  approved  the  acquisition  of the Company by  Purchaser,  which
acquisition  is to be effected by the  purchase of all the  outstanding  capital
stock of the Company by Purchaser  upon the terms and subject to the  conditions
set forth herein;

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing and the
mutual representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements set forth herein,
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

Section 1.1     Sale and Transfer of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement,  at the Closing Seller shall sell, convey,  assign,  transfer
and deliver to Purchaser all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the
issued and outstanding  Shares,  free and clear of all Encumbrances,  except for

Agreement,  in  consideration  of the aforesaid  sale,  conveyance,  assignment,
transfer and delivery to Purchaser of the Shares, at the Closing Purchaser shall

                                       1

Section 1.3   Closing and Post-Closing Adjustments.
              ------------------------------------

(a) No later than two (2) days before the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared,  and deliver to Purchaser a  Preliminary  Closing  Balance
Sheet and its calculation of the Preliminary  Working Capital.  The value of the
inventory to be included in Preliminary  Working  Capital shall be determined as
follows.  Promptly  after the date  hereof,  Purchaser  and  Seller  shall  work
together  in good  faith to  determine  the value of the  inventory  based  upon
saleability, returnability and reserves taken in accordance with past practices.
In the event  that  Purchaser  and  Seller  cannot  agree  upon the value of the
inventory,  the disputed amount shall not be included in the inventory reflected
on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, and Seller shall reserve all rights to
dispute such valuation pursuant to Section 1.3(d).

(b) The  amount by which the  Preliminary  Working  Capital is greater or lesser
than the Balance Sheet Working Capital shall be added to or subtracted  from, as
the case may be, the  Purchase  Price to be paid by  Purchaser  to Seller at the
Closing.  For  purposes  of  illustration,  an  example  of the  calculation  of
Preliminary  Working  Capital and the  adjustment  to the Purchase  Price is set
forth in Section 1.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(c) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,  Seller shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared,  and deliver to Purchaser the Closing Balance Sheet and
its calculation of Closing  Working  Capital.  The Company shall,  and Purchaser
shall cause the Company to, make  available to Seller such employees and records
of the Company as may be necessary for the  preparation  of the Closing  Balance
Sheet.  The value of the inventory  reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet shall
be determined  based upon its saleability,  returnability  and reserves taken in
accordance with past practice.

(d) Within  fifteen (15) days  following  receipt of the Closing  Balance Sheet,
Purchaser  shall inform Seller in writing of any objections to the  calculations
on  the  Closing  Balance  Sheet  (the  "Objections"),   setting  forth  written
explanations  of the Objections and the  adjustments  which  Purchaser  believes
should be made,  including,  without  limitation,  any  adjustments to inventory
consistent with the inventory valuation methodology set forth in Sections 1.3(a)
and (c). Following notice of the Objections, Seller shall have fifteen (15) days
to review  and  respond  in  writing to the  Objections  setting  forth  written
explanations  in those areas where it disagrees with the  Objections.  Purchaser
and Seller  will then have an  additional

                                       2
<PAGE>

fifteen  (15) days at the end of such period to attempt to resolve in good faith
the Objections.

(e) If  Purchaser  and Seller are unable to resolve  all of their  disagreements
with  respect to the  Objections  within the time  periods  specified in Section
1.3(d),  above,  they shall  refer any  unresolved  Objections  to a  nationally
recognized  firm of  independent  certified  public  accountants as to which the
parties mutually agree (the  "Arbitrator"),  who shall  determine,  based on the
information  submitted by Purchaser and Seller (and not by independent  review),
and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted,  whether and to
what extent  Closing  Working  Capital,  as shown on the Closing  Balance Sheet,
requires  adjustment.  The Arbitrator's  determination,  which shall be given to
Purchaser  and Seller  within  thirty (30) days of  referral to the  Arbitrator,
shall be final and binding  upon the parties  hereto.  The fees and  expenses of
such Arbitrator shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers.

(f) If the  Closing  Working  Capital is greater  than the  Preliminary  Working
Capital,  then the  difference  shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller within five
(5) business days of the final  determination  of the amount of such adjustment,
which  shall be payable in cash by wire  transfer  or  delivery  of  immediately
available  funds.  If the Closing  Working  Capital is less than the Preliminary
Working  Capital,  then the  difference  shall be paid by  Parent  or  Seller to
Purchaser within five business days of the final  determination of the amount of
such adjustment,  which shall be payable in cash by wire transfer or delivery of
immediately available funds.

(g) For all Tax purposes, any post-Closing Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to
Sections  1.3(f) and 1.4(d)  shall be treated as an  adjustment  to the Purchase
Price.

Section 1.4   Payment of Deferred Purchase Price and Additional Purchase Price.
              ----------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Within ten (10)  business  days after  February  28, 2001,  Purchaser  shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a worksheet ("Renewal Worksheet"), which shall set
forth in reasonable detail the following information concerning the selection by
resellers  or  service  providers  authorized  by Sun ("Sun  Resellers")  of the
distributors   from  which  they  will   purchase  Sun   products   ("Designated
Distributor"):

                                       3
<PAGE>

(i)      names of Sun Resellers who at such date had changed from the Company as
         their most  recent  Designated  Distributor  to another  party as their
         Designated Distributor ("Lost Resellers");

(ii)     names of Sun  Resellers who at such date had changed from another party
         as their most  recent  Designated  Distributor  to the Company as their
         Designated   Distributor   or  who  are  new  Sun  Resellers   ("Gained
         Resellers"); and

(iii)    the revenue to the  Designated  Distributors  of each Lost Reseller and
         Gained  Reseller from sales of Sun products  during the prior 12 months
         (the "Revenue Amount").

(b) The Company shall,  and Purchaser shall cause the Company to, make available
to Seller such  employees  and records of the  Company as may be  necessary  for
Seller's review of the Renewal Worksheet. Within ten (10) days following receipt
of the  Renewal  Worksheet,  Seller  shall  inform  Purchaser  in writing of any
objections to the calculations on the Renewal Worksheet (the "Renewal  Worksheet
Objections"),  setting  forth  written  explanations  of the  Renewal  Worksheet
Objections and the adjustments  which Seller believes should be made.  Following
notice of the Renewal Worksheet  Objections,  Purchaser shall have five (5) days
to review and respond in writing to the  Renewal  Worksheet  Objections  setting
forth written  explanations  in those areas where it disagrees  with the Renewal
Worksheet Objections. Purchaser and Seller will then have an additional ten (10)
days at the end of such  period to attempt to resolve in good faith the  Renewal
Worksheet Objections.

(c) If  Purchaser  and Seller are unable to resolve  all of their  disagreements
with  respect  to the  Renewal  Worksheet  Objections  within  the time  periods
specified in Section 1.4(b),  they shall refer any unresolved  Renewal Worksheet
Objections  to a nationally  recognized  firm of  independent  certified  public
accountants  as to which the  parties  mutually  agree (the  "Renewal  Worksheet
Arbitrator"),  who  shall  determine,  based  on the  information  submitted  by
Purchaser and Seller (and not by independent  review),  and only with respect to
the remaining  differences so submitted,  whether and to what extent the Renewal
Worksheet requires adjustment. The Renewal Worksheet Arbitrator's determination,
which shall be given to Purchaser and Seller within thirty (30) days of referral
to the Renewal Worksheet Arbitrator, shall be final and binding upon the parties
hereto.

                                       4
<PAGE>

The fees and expenses of such Renewal Worksheet Arbitrator shall be paid
one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller.

(d) If the aggregate  Revenue Amount from Gained Resellers equals or exceeds the
aggregate Revenue Amount from Lost Resellers ("Net Revenue Gain"),  Seller shall
be entitled to be paid (1) $25,000,000  ("Deferred  Purchase Price") plus (2) in
an amount equal to $1.00 for each $8.00 of Net Revenue Gain up to an  additional
$12,500,000 (the "Additional  Purchase Price").  If the aggregate Revenue Amount
from Lost Resellers  exceeds the aggregate  Revenue Amount from Gained Resellers
("Net Revenue Loss"),  Seller shall be entitled to be paid the Deferred Purchase
Price  reduced  by $1.00  for each  $8.00 of Net  Revenue  Loss (up to a maximum
deduction equal to the Deferred  Purchase Price).  Any amounts payable to Seller
pursuant to this Section 1.4 (d) shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller within two
business  days  of the  final  determination  of  such  amount,  in cash by wire
transfer or delivery of immediately available funds.

Section 1.5   Further Assurances.
              ------------------

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing,  Parent and Seller shall
execute and deliver to Purchaser such other documents and  instruments,  provide
such  materials  and  information  and take such other  actions as Purchaser may
reasonably  request  more  effectively  to vest title to the Shares in Purchaser
and, to the full extent permitted by law, to put Purchaser in actual  possession
and operating control of the Company and its properties and assets and books and
records,  and  otherwise to cause Seller to fulfill its  obligations  under this
Agreement.

(b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.5, if
the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or arbitration, the
furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance with any provision
of this Section 1.5 shall be subject to applicable rules relating to discovery.

has all  requisite  corporate  or other power and  authority  and all  necessary
governmental  approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its  business  as  now  being  conducted,  except  where  the  failure  to be so
organized,  existing and in good standing or to have such power, authority,  and
governmental  approvals  would not have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a
material  adverse  effect on  Parent's  or Seller's  ability to  consummate  the
Transactions.

Section  3.2      Authorization.  Each of Parent and  Seller has full  corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this  Agreement and to consummate the

execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement or the  consummation by it of
the Transactions.

Section 3.3     Execution;  Validity of Agreement.  This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Seller, and, assuming due and valid

subject to the  discretion  of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought.

Section 3.4     Consents and Approvals;  No Violations.  Except for the filings,
permits,  authorizations,  consents and approvals as may be required under,  and

entered  into  any  agreement  or  arrangement   entitling  any  agent,  broker,

duly  authorized by the Board of Directors of Purchaser,  and no other corporate
action on the part of Purchaser is necessary  to  authorize  the  execution  and
delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.
No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any class or series of stock issued by

the  availability  of the remedy of specific  performance or injunctive or other

respective  properties or assets may be bound,  or (d) violate any order,  writ,

being  understood  that the right to dispose of such  Shares  shall be  entirely

or otherwise  disposing of any of the Shares, or any interest  therein,  in such
manner as to cause Seller to be in violation of the registration requirements of

Section  4.5      Availability  of Funds.  Purchaser  will  have at the  Closing

the  Knowledge  of  Purchaser,  governmental  investigation  pending  or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser,  threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries

aggregate,  would have or would reasonably be expected to impede  materially the
ability of Purchaser to complete the Closing in all respects.

Section 4.7      Investigation  by  Purchaser.  Purchaser  has conducted its own
independent  investigation  of the  Company,  and has  relied  solely  upon  the
aforementioned  investigation and not on any factual  representations of Parent,

warranties of Parent and Seller set forth in Article III of this Agreement.

Section 5.1     Interim Operations of the Company.  Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement and except as set forth in the Disclosure  Schedule and except
as  may  be  consented  to in  writing  by  Purchaser  (such  consent  not to be
unreasonably  withheld  or delayed)  Seller  shall use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to procure  that,  after the date hereof and prior to the Closing  Date,
the business of the Company  shall be conducted in the same manner as heretofore
conducted  and  only  in the  ordinary  course  consistent  with  past  practice
(including with respect to the collections of accounts and notes  receivable and
replenishment of inventory) and it will not take any action,  and will cause the
Company not to take any  action,  that if taken  between the Balance  Sheet Date
through  the date  hereof,  would have had to have been  disclosed  pursuant  to
Section 3.12.

Section 5.2   Access; Confidentiality.
              -----------------------

(a) Seller  shall cause the Company  prior to the Closing to (i) give  Purchaser
and its  authorized  representatives  reasonable  access to all books,  records,
personnel,  offices and other  facilities  and  properties of the Company,  (ii)
permit Purchaser to make inspections thereof as Purchaser may reasonably request
and (iii)  cause the  officers  of the  Company to furnish  Purchaser  with such
financial and operating data and other  information with respect to the business
and  properties  of the Company as  Purchaser  may from time to time  reasonably
request;  provided,  however,  that  any  such  access  shall  be  conducted  at
Purchaser's  expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of Seller's or
the  Company's  personnel  and in such a manner as  reasonably  necessary not to
interfere  substantially  with the normal operation of the business of Seller or
the  Company.  Subject  to the  provisions  of Section  5.4(h),  notwithstanding
anything  contained in this or any other agreement  between Purchaser and Parent
and/or Seller  executed prior to the date hereof,  none of the Company,  Parent,
Seller or any of their  respective  Affiliates shall have any obligation to make
available  to  Purchaser  or its  representatives,  or provide  Purchaser or its
representatives with, any consolidated,  combined or unitary Tax Return filed by
Parent or any of its Affiliates or predecessors, or any related material (except
as

                                       25
<PAGE>

any such material may relate solely to the Company) and nothing  herein shall
require  Parent,  Seller or the Company to disclose any information to Purchaser
if such  disclosure  would (i)  jeopardize  any  attorney-client  or other legal
privilege or (ii)  contravene  any  applicable  laws,  fiduciary duty or binding
agreement  entered  into  prior to the  date of this  Agreement  (including  any
confidentiality  agreement to which Parent,  Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party).

(b) The provisions of the Confidentiality  Agreement shall remain binding and in
full force and effect until the Closing.  The information  contained  herein, in
the   Disclosure   Schedule  or  delivered   to  Purchaser  or  its   authorized
representatives   pursuant  hereto  shall  be  subject  to  the  Confidentiality
Agreement  as  Evaluation  Material  (as defined  and subject to the  exceptions
contained  therein)  until the Closing and, for that purpose and to that extent,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated herein by reference.
Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  5.5,  Purchaser  shall  cause  its
consultants,  advisors and  representatives to treat the terms of this Agreement
after the date hereof as strictly  confidential (unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of legal counsel, by other
requirements of law).

Section 5.3       Efforts and Actions to Cause Closing to Occur.
                  ---------------------------------------------

(a) Prior to the Closing,  upon the terms and subject to the  conditions of this
Agreement,  Purchaser,  Parent and Seller shall use their respective  reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,  and to do, or cause to
be done and  cooperate  with each other in order to do,  all  things  reasonably
necessary,  proper or advisable  (subject to any applicable  laws) to consummate
the Closing and the other Transactions as promptly as practicable, including the
preparation and filing of all forms,  registrations  and notices  required to be
filed to  consummate  the Closing and the other  Transactions  and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, authorizations,
consents, orders, licenses,  permits,  qualifications,  exemptions or waivers by
any third party or Governmental Entity. In addition,  no party hereto shall take
any action after the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to materially
delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,  approval or
consent from any  Governmental  Entity or other  Person  required to be obtained
prior to Closing.  Nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall require  Parent,
Seller or the Company to pay any consideration to any other Person from whom any
such   approvals,   authorizations,   consents,   orders,   licenses,   permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waiver is requested.

                                       26

hereto with respect to, provide any necessary  information  with respect to, and
provide the other  parties  (or their  respective  counsel)  with copies of, all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information
supplied  by such  party  to a  Governmental  Entity  in  connection  with  this
Agreement  and the  Transactions.  Each party hereto shall  promptly  inform the
other party of any  communication  received by such party from any  Governmental
Entity  regarding  any of the  Transactions.  If any party  hereto or  Affiliate
thereof receives a request for information or documentary material from any such
Governmental  Entity with  respect to any of the  Transactions,  then such party
shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable  and after  consultation  with the  other  parties,  an  appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

(c) In addition to and without limiting the agreements of the parties  contained
above, Purchaser and Seller shall

(i)      take  promptly  all actions  reasonably  necessary  to make the filings
         required of them or any of their Affiliates under the HSR Act,

(ii)     comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
         information or documentary material received by the Company, Purchaser,
         Seller or any of their  Affiliates  from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to
         the HSR Act or from any state  Attorney  General or other  Governmental
         Entity in connection with antitrust matters,

(iii)    cooperate  with each other in connection  with any filing under the HSR
         Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
         concerning  the  Transactions  commenced  by the FTC,  DOJ,  any  state
         Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity,

(iv)     use their  commercially  reasonable efforts to resolve such objections,
         if any, as may be asserted with respect to the  Transactions  under any
         antitrust law, and

(v)      advise the other parties promptly of any communication received by such
         party  from the FTC,  DOJ,  any  state  Attorney  General  or any other
         Governmental  Entity  regarding  any  of the  Transactions,  and of any
         understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party


                                       27
<PAGE>

         proposes to make or enter into with the FTC,  DOJ,  any state  Attorney
         General  or any  other  Governmental  Entity  in  connection  with  the
         Transactions.

Concurrently  with the  filing  of  notifications  under  the HSR Act or as soon
thereafter  as  practicable,  Seller  and  Purchaser  shall each  request  early
termination of the HSR Act waiting period.

(i)      Parent  shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax  Returns  that
         are  required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable
         years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and Parent shall
         remit (or cause to be remitted),  subject to Section 8.1(b),  any Taxes
         due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(ii)     Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that
         are  required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable
         years or periods  ending after the Closing Date,  and  Purchaser  shall
         remit (or cause to be  remitted)  any Taxes due in  respect of such Tax
         Returns.

(iii)    Any Tax  Return  required  to be filed  by  Purchaser  relating  to any
         Straddle  Period  shall  be  submitted  (with  copies  of any  relevant
         schedules,  work  papers and other  documentation  then  available)  to
         Parent  for  Parent's  approval  not less than 30 days prior to the Due
         Date for the filing of such Tax  Return,  which  approval  shall not be
         unreasonably  withheld.  Purchaser  shall  prepare or have the  Company
         prepare such returns in accordance  with past practice,  if any, to the
         extent permissible under applicable law.

(iv)     Upon the  written  request of  Purchaser  setting  forth in  reasonable
         detail  the  computation  of  the  amount  owed,  Parent  shall  pay to
         Purchaser,  no later than two (2)  Business  Days prior to the Due Date
         for the  applicable  Tax Return,  the Taxes for which  Parent is liable
         pursuant  to  Section  8.1(b)(ii)  but which are  payable  with any Tax
         Return to be filed by Purchaser with respect to any Straddle Period.

<PAGE>

         materials, including schedules and work papers, requested in writing by
         Parent to enable Parent to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to
         be prepared  and filed by it pursuant to Section  5.4(a)(i).  Purchaser
         shall  prepare such package in good faith in a manner  consistent  with
         Parent's past practice to the extent permissible under applicable law.

(vi)     Parent may, in its sole and absolute  discretion,  amend any Tax Return
         filed or required to be filed for any taxable  years or periods  ending
         on or before the Closing Date,  provided Parent  indemnifies  Purchaser
         and the Company  against any Taxes  attributable to any taxable year or
         period that results from such amendment and provided that any amendment
         shall not  increase  the  Incremental  Tax Cost as  defined  in Section
         5.4(j).

(b)      Computation of Tax Liabilities.

     (i)  To the extent permitted or required by law or administrative practice,
          (A) the taxable  year of the Company  which  includes the Closing Date
          shall be treated as closing on (and  including)  the Closing Date and,
          notwithstanding the foregoing, (B) all transactions of the Company not
          in the ordinary course of business occurring after the Closing,  other
          than  those  pursuant  to plans  adopted  by the  Company  before  the
          Closing,  shall be reported on Purchaser's  consolidated United States
          federal  income  Tax  Return  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Treasury
          Regulation  Section  1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)  and  shall  be  similarly
          reported on other Tax Returns of  Purchaser or its  Affiliates  to the
          extent  permitted  by law.  For  purposes  of Sections  5.4(a)(i)  and
          (a)(ii),  where  it is  necessary  to  apportion  between  Parent  and
          Purchaser  the Tax  liability  of the  Company  for a Straddle  Period
          (which is not  treated  under the  immediately  preceding  sentence as
          closing on the Closing  Date),  such  liability  shall be  apportioned
          between  the period  deemed to end at the close of the  Closing  Date,
          subject to Sections 8.1(b)(i) and 8.1(e)(i),  and the period deemed to
          begin at the  beginning of the day  following  the Closing Date on the
          basis of an interim  closing of the books,  except that Taxes (such as
          real property  Taxes)  imposed on a periodic  basis shall be allocated
          pro rata per diem.

     (ii) In  determining  Parent's  liability for a particular  Tax pursuant to
          this Agreement,  Parent shall be credited with the amount of estimated
          Taxes paid by or on behalf of the Company  prior to the  Closing  with
          respect to that particular Tax to the extent such Tax is credited by a
          Taxing  Authority

                                       29
<PAGE>

          to the  relevant  Tax period of the Company.  To the
          extent that Parent's liability for a particular Tax for a taxable year
          or period is less than the amount of any estimated Taxes paid prior to
          Closing  by or on  behalf  of the  Company  with  respect  to all or a
          portion of such taxable year or period, Purchaser shall pay Parent the
          difference  within two days of filing the Tax Return  relating to such
          Taxes,   provided,   however,   that  Purchaser's  and  the  Company's
          obligations  shall be governed by Section 5.4(d)(i) to the extent such
          estimated Taxes paid prior to Closing entitle Purchaser or the Company
          to a refund of Taxes.

(c) Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes resulting  directly from the Transactions
shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.  Notwithstanding  the provisions
of Section  5.4(a),  which shall not apply to Tax  Returns  relating to Transfer
Taxes,  any Tax Returns that must be filed in  connection  with  Transfer  Taxes
shall be  prepared  and filed  when due by the party  primarily  or  customarily
responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such
party will use its  reasonable  efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other
party at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Returns.

(d)      Refunds

     (i)  Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by
          Purchaser  or the  Company,  and any amounts  credited  against Tax to
          which Purchaser or the Company becomes  entitled  (including by way of
          any amended Tax Returns or any carryback  filing),  that relate to any
          taxable period,  or portion  thereof,  ending on or before the Closing
          Date shall be for the account of Parent,  and Purchaser shall pay over
          to Parent any such refund or the amount of any such credit within five
          days after  receipt  or  entitlement  thereto.  For  purposes  of this
          Section 5.4(d),  where it is necessary to apportion a refund or credit
          between  Purchaser  and Parent for a Straddle  Period,  such refund or
          credit shall be  apportioned  between the period  deemed to end at the
          close  of the  Closing  Date  and the  period  deemed  to begin at the
          beginning  of the day  following  the Closing  Date on the basis of an
          interim closing of the Company's books, except that refunds or credits
          of Taxes (e.g., real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall
          be allocated pro rata per diem.

(ii)     Purchaser  shall  cooperate,  and cause the  Company to  cooperate,  in
         obtaining  any Tax refund of Taxes of the Company for a period prior

                                       30
<PAGE>

         to the Closing Date that Parent  reasonably  believes should be
         available, including,  without  limitation,  through filing appropriate
         forms with the  applicable  Taxing  Authorities,  provided  that  such
         Tax  refund request does not cause a Tax detriment to the Company or
         Purchaser.

(e)      Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments.

     (i)  If the examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return of
          Parent for any taxable  period  ending on or before the  Closing  Date
          shall result (by  settlement  or otherwise)  in any  adjustment  which
          permits Purchaser or the Company to increase deductions, losses or tax
          credits or decrease  the  income,  gains or  recapture  of tax credits
          which would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been reported or
          taken into  account  (including  by way of any  increase  in basis) by
          Purchaser  or the Company  for one or more  periods  ending  after the
          Closing  Date,  Parent  shall  notify  Purchaser  and  provide it with
          adequate  information  so that  Purchaser  can  reflect  on its or the
          Company's  Tax Returns  such  increases in  deductions,  losses or tax
          credits or  decreases  in income,  gains or  recapture  of tax credits
          within 30 days of such  adjustment.  Purchaser  shall  pay to  Parent,
          within  30 days  of the  receipt  of the  amount  of any Tax  Benefits
          Actually  Realized to the extent of any additional  Taxes and decrease
          in Tax Benefits resulting from the adjustments to Parent's Tax Return.

          (ii) If the  examination  of any  federal,  state,  local or other Tax
               Return of Purchaser or the Company for any taxable  period ending
               after the Closing Date shall result (by  settlement or otherwise)
               in any adjustment  which permits  Parent to increase  deductions,
               losses or tax credits or decrease the income,  gains or recapture
               of tax credits which would  otherwise (but for such  adjustments)
               have been reported or taken into account (including by way of any
               increase in basis) by Parent for one or more periods ending on or
               before  the  Closing  Date,  Purchaser  shall  notify  Parent and
               provide it with adequate  information  so that Parent can reflect
               on its Tax Returns such  increases in  deductions,  losses or tax
               credits or decreases in income, gains or recapture of tax credits
               within 30 days of such adjustment.  Parent or Seller shall pay to
               Purchaser, within 30 days of the receipt of the amount of any Tax
               Benefits  Actually Realized to the extent of any additional Taxes
               and decrease in Tax Benefits  resulting  from the  adjustments to
               Purchaser's or the Company's Tax Return.

         Taxes.

(i)      Purchaser  shall not permit the Company to take any action with respect
         to any Tax authority except for any actions contemplated or governed by
         this  Agreement  (including the settlement of a Tax claim in accordance
         with Section 8.2(b) and the actions  contemplated  by this Section 5.4)
         which  could  increase   Parent's  or  Seller's   liability  for  Taxes

         Taxes pursuant to this Agreement).

(ii)     None of Purchaser or any  Affiliate of Purchaser  shall (or shall cause

         taxable  year or period  ending on or before the Closing  Date (or with

         Parent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

(iii)    None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall (or shall cause
         or permit the Company to) carryback for Federal, state, local or
         foreign tax purposes to any taxable period, or portion thereof, of the
         Company, Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates ending before, or
         which includes, the Closing Date any operating losses, net operating
         losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in,
         resulting from, or generated in connection with a taxable year of
         Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser, or portion thereof, ending on
         or after the Closing Date.

(g)  Termination  of Existing Tax Sharing  Agreements.  Any and all existing Tax

(h)  Assistance  and  Cooperation.  After the Closing  Date,  each of Parent and
Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

(i)      timely sign and deliver such  certificates or forms as may be necessary
         or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or
         file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Transfer Taxes;

<PAGE>

(ii)     assist the other party in  preparing  any Tax Returns  which such other
         party is  responsible  for  preparing  and  filing in  accordance  with
         Section 5.4(a);

(iii)    cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Taxing

         to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company; and

(v)      furnish the other with copies of all  correspondence  received from any
         Taxing  Authority  in  connection  with any Tax  audit  or  information
         request with respect to any such taxable period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement,  none of
Purchaser, Parent nor Seller, nor any of their Affiliates,  shall have the right
to receive or obtain any information  relating to Taxes of Purchaser,  Parent or
Seller,  any of  their  Affiliates,  or any of  their  predecessors  other  than

compounded daily, if not paid when due.

(j) Section 338(h)(10). (i) At the request of Purchaser, Parent and Seller agree
to cooperate  with Purchaser in making or causing to be made (and in determining
the cost of  making  or  causing  to be made) a timely  election  (the  "Section
338(h)(10)  Election") under Section  338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the
purchase by Purchaser of the Shares and to file such Section 338(h)(10) Election
in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury  Regulations.  Parent, Seller
and Purchaser will make, at Purchaser's request, such other similar elections as
may be  necessary  for state  income  tax  purposes,  and for  purposes  of this
Agreement, the term "Section 338(h)(10) Election" shall be deemed to include any
such state income tax elections.  If any Section 338(h)(10)  Election is made by
Parent, Seller and Purchaser,  Purchaser shall pay to Seller any Incremental Tax
Cost of the  Section  338(h)(10)  Election.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Incremental  Tax Cost" shall

                                       33
<PAGE>

Company in  connection  with the  Section  338(h)(10) Election; (B) the excess,
if any, of (I) the actual combined U.S. federal, state
and local income Tax liability of Parent, Seller and the Company attributable to

state and local income Tax liability  that Parent and Seller would have incurred
as a result of the sale of the Shares if no  Section  338(h)(10))  Election  had
been made; and (C) any additional Taxes imposed on Parent or Seller attributable
to the receipt of payments pursuant to this Section 5.4(j). (ii) Purchaser shall
not make any election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable provision
of state,  local or foreign  law) other than the  Section  338(h)(10)  Election,
except for any such election deemed to be made in any  jurisdiction by reason of
the making of the  Section  338(h)(10)  Election.  (iii) After the  Closing,  if
Purchaser notifies or has notified Parent in writing that it intends to make the
Section  338(h)(10)  Election,  Parent  and  Purchaser  shall  use  commercially
reasonable  efforts to agree to an allocation of the Modified  Aggregate  Deemed
Sale Price (as defined under applicable  Treasury  Regulations) among the assets
of the Company within 60 days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that if
Parent and  Purchaser  shall not have agreed on such  allocation by the sixtieth
day following the Closing Date, such allocation shall be made in accordance with
the  appraisal  of a  recognized  appraisal  firm chosen and  retained by mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Parent,  the fees and expenses of which shall be paid
one-half by Parent and one-half by Purchaser.  Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall  reflect such  allocation  in all  applicable  Tax Returns filed by any of
them. None of Parent, Purchaser nor the Company shall take a position before any
Taxing Authority or otherwise  (including in any Tax Return)  inconsistent  with
such allocation.

Section  5.5      Publicity.  Purchaser  and Parent  shall each issue an initial
press  release  with  respect to the  execution  of this  Agreement  after prior
consultation with the parties hereto. Thereafter, until the Closing, or the date
the  Transactions  are terminated or abandoned  pursuant to Article VII, none of
Parent,  Seller,  the Company,  Purchaser or any of their respective  Affiliates
shall  issue or cause the  publication  of any  press  release  or other  public
announcement  with respect to this Agreement or the  Transactions  without prior
consultation  with the other  party,  except as may be required by law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading market.

Section 5.6       Employees; Employee Benefits.
                  ----------------------------

(a) Immediately  prior to the Closing,  Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause
any of their Affiliates if necessary to, transfer to the Company each person who
was actively employed and working primarily for the Company immediately prior to
the Closing (the "Employees").  Section 5.6(a) of the Disclosure  Schedule lists
each such Employee as of the date hereof.  Prior to Closing,  Seller shall cause
all account  balances and other  interests of Employees under Parent=s 401K plan
to be fully  vested  as of the  Closing  Date.  The  Company  shall  assume  all
liabilities  and  obligations  relating  to or  arising  out of  the  Employees'
employment prior to the Closing;  provided,  however, that (i) the Company shall
not assume any liabilities or obligations  pursuant to any employee benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), compensation or incentive plan sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by any entity other than the Company;  and (ii) the
Company shall not assume any liabilities or obligations related to the Employees
which have not been accrued on the Closing  Balance Sheet,  set forth in Section
5.6(a)(i)(4) of the Disclosure  Schedule or any employment,  severance or change
of control  agreements  or  arrangement  not  listed on  Section  3.15(c) of the
Disclosure  Schedule.  Except as  expressly  assumed in the  previous  sentence,
Seller  and  Parent  shall  remain  liable and  indemnify  Purchaser  and/or the
Company,  for all  liabilities  and  obligations  relating  to or arising out of
Employee=s  employment  prior to the Closing.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,
Purchaser  hereby assumes and agrees to perform each of the agreements set forth
in Section 3.15(c) of the Disclosure Schedule in the same manner and to the same
extent  that  Parent,  Seller or the  Company  would be  required  to perform it
whether or not the Transactions occurred,  such assumption to be effective as of
the Closing.

(b) On and  after the  Closing,  until at least  the  first  anniversary  of the
Closing,  Purchaser  shall  cause the  Company to  provide  the  Employees  with
salaries,  incentive  opportunities and benefit plans, programs and arrangements
no less  favorable in the aggregate than those provided as of the date hereof by
Seller and the Company  or, at  Purchaser's  option,  no less  favorable  in the
aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser.

(c) If any Employee becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan, practice
or policy of Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates,  such Employee  shall be given
credit, for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting, under such plan for
all  service  prior to the  Closing  Date with the  Company  or any  predecessor

                                       35
<PAGE>

employer  (to the extent  such  credit was given by Seller,  the  Company or any
predecessor  employer),  and all service with the Company or Purchaser following
the Closing Date but prior to the time such employee becomes such a participant;
provided,  however,  such  service  need not be  credited to the extent it would
result in a duplication  of benefits,  including  benefit  accrual under defined
benefit  plans,  or  would  constitute  a  violation  of  the  terms  of  any of
Purchaser's  plans. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods,  evidence of insurability  requirements,  or the application of
any  preexisting  condition  limitations.  Employees  shall be given  credit for
amounts  paid under a  corresponding  benefit  plan  during the same  period for
purposes of  applying  deductibles,  copayments  and  out-of-pocket  maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the comparable Purchaser employee benefit plan.

(d) If any  Employee  is  discharged  by the  Company  after the  Closing,  then
Purchaser  shall  be  responsible  for all  severance  costs,  if any,  for such
Employee incurred by the Purchaser under the Company's severance plan. Purchaser
shall be responsible and assume all liability for all notices or payments due to
any  Employees,  and all  notices,  payments,  fines or  assessments  due to any
Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable foreign, federal, state or local
law,  common law,  statute,  rule or regulation with respect to the discharge or
layoff of Employees by the Company as of the Closing, including the WARN Act and
any rules or regulations  as have been issued in connection  with the foregoing.
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any employment loss within the meaning of
the WARN Act suffered by any  Employee on or within the 90 day period  following
the Closing shall have been caused by  Purchaser's  decision not to continue the
employment of such  Employee,  and shall not have been caused as a result of the
sale of the Shares of the Company  pursuant to this  Agreement.  For purposes of
this  Agreement,  the  Closing  Date is and shall be the same as the  "effective
date" within the meaning of the WARN Act.

Section 5.7     Transition  Services Agreement;  Lease Agreement.  Purchaser and
Seller  agree (a) to negotiate  in good faith a  Transition  Services  Agreement
containing the terms set forth on Exhibit A, and (b) to execute and deliver such
Transition Services Agreement and the Lease Agreement (substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B) at Closing.

Section 5.8       Intercompany Arrangements; Accounts Receivable.
                  ----------------------------------------------

(a) On or prior to the Closing  Date,  all  intercompany  accounts  owing by the
Company,  on the one hand,  to the  Seller  and its  Affiliates  (excluding  the


                                       36
<PAGE>

Company),  on the other hand, shall be converted into equity without any payment
of funds in connection  therewith.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  prior to the
Closing any existing cash balance on the Company's  books will be transferred to
Seller and the MCF Note will be  cancelled.  In  addition,  except as  otherwise
expressly  contemplated  by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.8 of the
Disclosure Schedule,  all agreements and commitments,  whether written,  oral or
otherwise, which are solely between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and
its Affiliates (excluding the Company),  on the other hand,  including,  without
limitation,  any  intercompany  notes to Seller,  shall be terminated  and of no
further  effect,  simultaneously  with the Closing without any further action or
liability on the part of the parties thereto.

(b) Prior to the Closing,  the Company shall repurchase all outstanding accounts
receivable  previously  sold to MCF  (the  "MCF  Receivables"),  which  shall be
reflected on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet
at a price equal to their face amount net of reserves,  and the MCF Note will be
cancelled.  The  receivables  shall be included in all  calculations  of Working
Capital pursuant to Section 1.3.

Section 5.9      Maintenance  of Books and Records.  Each of the parties  hereto
shall  preserve,  until at least the third  anniversary of the Closing Date, all
pre-Closing Date records  possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to
the Company.  After the Closing Date and up until at least the third anniversary
of the Closing  Date,  upon any  reasonable  request  from a party hereto or its
representatives,  the  party  holding  such  records  shall (a)  provide  to the
requesting party or its representatives reasonable access to such records during
normal business hours and (b) permit the requesting party or its representatives
to make copies of such records,  in each case at no cost to the requesting party
or its  representatives  (other  than for  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses);
provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall require either party to disclose
any  information  to  the  other  if  such  disclosure   would   jeopardize  any
attorney-client  or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable law. Such
records may be sought under this Section for any reasonable  purpose,  including
to the extent reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, tax,
litigation,  federal  securities  disclosure or other similar needs of the party
seeking such records.

Section 5.10    Seller's Trademarks and Logos.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained in this Agreement,  it is expressly agreed that (a) with the
exception of (i) all of Parent's and Seller's  Intellectual  Property  Rights in

                                       37
<PAGE>

"MOCA", (ii) any right of the Company to use third party Intellectual  Property,
where such right is  primarily  used and  reasonably  necessary  to conduct  the
business of the Company as presently  conducted  or as currently  proposed to be
conducted,  other  than as set forth in Section  3.23 or 5.10 of the  Disclosure
Schedule,  and (iii) any Copyright that is  exclusively  used, and any Masks and
Trade  Secrets to the extent  currently  used,  in the  business of the Company,
other than as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Disclosure  Schedule,  Parent and
Seller  retain  all  rights,  title and  interest  in all  Company  Intellectual
Property, (b) Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining, and
the Company  will not be  entitled to retain  following  the Closing  Date,  any
right,  title or interest in any Trademarks  employing Parent's or Seller's name
or any part or variation of such names or anything  confusingly  similar thereto
and (c) neither the Company nor Purchaser or its  Affiliates  shall make any use
of or display  Parent's or Seller's  Trademarks  from and after the Closing,  in
each case,  other than in connection with (i) advertising  materials,  forms and
similar  materials  in  existence  or on order on the Closing  Date bearing such
names or  Trademarks  and (ii)  branding and  marketing  the Company=s new name,
Trademarks and other Intellectual Property;  provided, however, Purchaser agrees
to and  agrees  to  cause  the  Company  to  discontinue  such  use as  soon  as
practicable  but in no event  later than 120 days  after the  Closing  Date.  In
addition,  Purchaser will do all things reasonably necessary including,  without
limitation,  signing any documentation to perfect Parent=s or Seller=s exclusive
ownership  rights in their  Trademarks at any time after the Closing.  Purchaser
shall  change the name of the  Company at the  Closing to a name which shall not
include  "Merisel."  On  and  after  the  Closing,   Parent,  Seller  and  their
Subsidiaries  shall not use the name "Open  Computing  Alliance" as a trademark,
service mark, trade name or corporate name in connection with their businesses.

Section 5.11      Insurance Policies.
                  ------------------

(a) Except as provided in subsection  (b),  Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
Purchaser's Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing) not to, assert,
by way of claim,  action,  litigation or  otherwise,  any right to any Insurance
Policy or any benefit under any such Insurance Policy. Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company)  shall  retain all right,  title and interest in and to
the Insurance  Policies,  including  the right to any credit or return  premiums
due, paid or payable in connection with the termination thereof.

                                       38
<PAGE>

Section 5.12      No Solicitation.
                  ---------------

(a) Parent and Seller will, and will use their reasonable efforts to cause their
respective  Affiliates  to,  immediately  cease  any  existing  discussions  and
negotiations  with any parties  conducted up to the date of this  Agreement with
respect to any  proposal  relating  to an  Acquisition  Transaction  (as defined
below).  Parent and Seller agree that,  before the  Closing,  they will not, and
will not authorize or knowingly permit any of their  respective  subsidiaries or
any of their or their  subsidiaries'  directors,  officers or employees  to, and
will use their  reasonable  best  efforts to cause their  respective  agents and
representatives not to, solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by
way of  furnishing or disclosing  non-public  information)  any inquiries or the
making of any proposal with respect to any  acquisition  of all or a significant
portion of the  Company by means of a merger,  consolidation  or other  business
combination involving the Company or acquisition of all or a significant portion
of the assets or capital stock of the Company (an "Acquisition  Transaction") or
negotiate,  explore or otherwise engage in substantive  communications  with any
person (other than Purchaser or its directors,  officers,  employees, agents and
representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Transaction,  or enter into any
agreement,  arrangement or understanding requiring Seller to abandon,  terminate
or fail to consummate the Transactions.

(b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  nothing  contained in this Agreement will
prohibit  Parent or  Seller  from (i)  soliciting,  providing  information  with
respect to or  agreeing to or engaging  in any  transactions  involving  Parent,
Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries other than the Company (a "Parent

which neither Parent nor Seller has assumed the defense of any such  third-party
claim (other than during any period in which  Purchaser will have failed to give
notice of the third-party  claim as provided above). If Parent or Seller assumes
such  defense,  Purchaser  shall have the right to  participate  in the  defense
thereof and to employ  counsel,  at its own expense,  separate  from the counsel
employed by Parent or Seller,  it being  understood  that Parent or

                                       50
<PAGE>

Seller shall control  such  defense.  If Parent or Seller  chooses to defend or
prosecute  a third-party  claim,  Purchaser shall  cooperate at Parent's or
Seller's  expense (other  than  Purchaser's  expenses  for  counsel
which  shall be  employed  at Purchaser's  own  expense  and  Purchaser's
internal  costs) in the  defense or prosecution  thereof,  which cooperation
shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent or Seller,
the  retention,  and the  provision to Parent or
Seller,  of records and  information  reasonably  relevant  to such  third-party
claim,  and making employees of the Company  available on a mutually  convenient
basis  to  provide  additional  information  and  explanation  of any  materials
provided  hereunder.  If Parent or Seller  chooses  to defend or  prosecute  any
third-party  claim,  Purchaser  shall  agree to any  settlement,  compromise  or
discharge  of such  third-party  claim that Parent or Seller may  recommend  and
that, by its terms,  discharges  Purchaser  from the full amount of liability in
connection with such third-party claim. None of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates
or the Company may settle or otherwise  dispose of any Claim for which Parent or
Seller may have a  liability  under this  Agreement  without  the prior  written
consent of Parent or Seller,  as the case may be, which  consent may be withheld
in the sole discretion of such party,  unless  Purchaser fully  indemnifies such
party in writing with respect to such liability in a manner satisfactory to such
party.  Neither  Parent nor Seller shall be liable under this Section 8.2(a) for
any settlement,  compromise or discharge  effected without its consent which may
not be unreasonably  withheld in respect of any claim for which indemnity may be
sought  hereunder.  No  indemnified  party  shall take any action the purpose of
which is to  prejudice  the  defense  of any claim  subject  to  indemnification
hereunder   or  to  induce  a  third   party  to  assert  a  claim   subject  to
indemnification hereunder.

(b) (i) Each party  hereto shall notify the chief tax officer of the other party
in writing within 15 days  following  receipt by such party of written notice of
any pending or threatened  audits,  notice of deficiency,  proposed  adjustment,
assessment,  examination  or other  administrative  or court  proceeding,  suit,
dispute or other claim which could affect the  liability for Taxes of such other
party.  If the party  required to give such notice  fails to give such notice to
the other party promptly,  it shall not be entitled to  indemnification  for any
Taxes arising in  connection  with such Tax claim if and to the extent that such
failure to give notice  materially and adversely affects the other party's right
to participate in or defend the Tax claim.

          (ii)  Parent  shall have the sole  right to  represent  the  Company's
     interests in any Tax claim relating to taxable  periods ending on or before
     the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the
     case of a

                                       51
<PAGE>

     Straddle  Period,  Parent shall be entitled to participate at its
     expense in any Tax claim relating in any part to Taxes  attributable to the
     portion of such Straddle Period deemed to end on or before the Closing Date
     and, with the written consent of Purchaser,  at Parent's sole expense,  may
     assume  the  control  of such  Tax  claim.  None of  Purchaser,  any of its
     Affiliates or the Company may settle or otherwise  dispose of any Tax claim
     for which it is reasonably  likely that Parent will have a liability  under
     this Agreement  without the prior written consent of Parent,  which consent
     may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 8.3     Resolution of All Tax-Related  Disputes. If Parent and Purchaser
cannot  agree  on the  calculation  of  any  amount  relating  to  Taxes  or the
interpretation  or application  of any provision of this  Agreement  relating to
Taxes, such dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually  acceptable to each of Parent and  Purchaser,  whose  decision shall be
final and binding upon all persons  involved and whose  expenses shall be shared
equally by Parent and Purchaser.

Section 8.4     Tax Effect of Indemnification  Payments.  All indemnity payments
made  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall be  treated  for all Tax  purposes  as
adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Shares.

Section 8.5       No Duplication; Sole Remedy Procedures.
                  --------------------------------------

(a) Any  liability for  indemnification  hereunder  shall be determined  without
duplication  of  recovery  by reason of the state of facts  giving  rise to such
liability  constituting  a breach  of more  than one  representation,  warranty,
covenant or agreement or the collection of insurance proceeds.

(b) Purchaser's  rights to  indemnification as provided for in Section 8.1 for a
breach of Parent's or Seller's  representations or warranties  contained in this
Agreement  shall  constitute  Purchaser's  sole  remedy  for such a breach,  and
neither Parent nor Seller shall have any other liability or damages to Purchaser
resulting from the breach.

(c) The  indemnification  and other provisions of this Article VIII shall govern
the procedure for all  indemnification  matters under this Agreement,  except to
the extent otherwise expressly provided herein.

pursuant to this  Agreement  or  otherwise  (including  against  indemnification
payments).

Section  10.4     Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more
counterparts,  all of which shall be considered  one and the same  agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 10.5    Entire Agreement;  No Third Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement
and the Confidentiality  Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior  agreements  and  understandings,  both  written  and oral,  among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 10.6     Severability.  Any term or provision of this  Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void
or  unenforceable  in any  situation  in any  jurisdiction  shall not affect the

validity or  enforceability  of the  offending  term or  provision  in any other
situation  or in any other  jurisdiction.  If the final  judgment  of a court of
competent  jurisdiction or other  authority  declares that any term or provision
hereof is  invalid,  void or  unenforceable,  the  parties  agree that the court

area or  applicability  of the term or provision,  to delete  specific  words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or

Section 10.7    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed

Section 10.8    Venue.  Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware  state court in the event any dispute  arises out of
this Agreement or any of the Transactions,  (b) agrees that it shall not attempt
to deny or defeat  such  personal  jurisdiction  by motion or other  request for
leave  from any such  court and (c)  agrees  that it shall not bring any  action
relating to this Agreement or any of the  Transactions in any court other than a
federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware; provided, however, that
such  consent to  jurisdiction  is solely for the  purposes  referred to in this
Section 10.8 and shall not be deemed a general submission to the jurisdiction of
said courts in the State of Delaware.

Section 10.9    Time of Essence.  Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that,
with  regard to all  dates and time  periods  set forth or  referred  to in this

obligations or other acts of the other party,  (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or
in any document  delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by
the other parties with any of the  agreements  or  conditions  contained in this
Agreement.  Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an  instrument  in  writing  signed by or on
behalf of such party.  The failure of any party to this  Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

Section  10.11    Assignment.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor any of the  rights,
interests  or  obligations  hereunder  shall be  assigned  by any of the parties
hereto  (whether by operation  of law or  otherwise)  without the prior  written
consent of the other  parties,  provided,  however,  that  Purchaser  may assign
without  Parent's or Seller's  consent any or all of its rights,  interests  and
obligations  hereunder (including without limitation its respective rights under
Article VIII) to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser; provided, further, that
any  such


                                       66
<PAGE>


Subsidiary  agrees  in  writing  to be  bound  by all  of the  terms,
conditions and provisions contained herein, and no such assignment shall relieve

Agreement  shall be binding upon,  inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
