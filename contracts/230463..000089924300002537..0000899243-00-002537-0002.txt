Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or other appropriate form) for an offering

Securities Act of such number of Registrable Securities then owned by the
Shareholders.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the

calendar day following the Effective Time.  The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective and
usable for the resale of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act

date upon which all the Registrable Securities covered by such shelf
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such shelf Registration
Statement or (iii) the first date upon which all the Registrable Securities

          (b)  If during the period from the 181st day following the Effective
Time through the second anniversary of the Effective Time, the Shareholder
Representative, upon the request of the Shareholders holding at least 50% of the
Registrable Securities, shall request the Company in writing (a "Demand") to

provisions of Section 3.1(b), use its reasonable best efforts to take such
action as may be necessary to enable the requesting shareholders to effect a

                 --------
be distributed pursuant to such Demand shall not be less than 4,000,000 and
shall not exceed 7,000,000 and provided further that the number of shares of

Registrable Securities each Shareholder will be entitled to have included in
such Public Offering pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be allocated among all
Shareholders requesting to participate in such Public Offering in proportion (as
nearly as practicable) to the amount of Registrable Securities owned by each
requesting Shareholder at the time of the Public

                                       3
<PAGE>

Offering. Except as provided in Section 2.1(b), the manner of distribution for
Registrable Securities included in the shelf Registration Statement shall not
include a Public Offering.

          (c)  In connection with any Demand under Section 2.1(b), the
Shareholder Representative shall enter into an underwriting agreement and other
ancillary agreements (such as a custody agreement) in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters. The Shareholder Representative will select the lead
underwriter for such offering from the list of institutions set forth on
Schedule B hereto or their successors and the Company shall select the co-
manager for such offering from the institutions on such list or their
successors. No Shareholders shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Shareholder, the
Registrable Securities of such Shareholder and such Shareholder's intended
method of distribution and any other representations required by law or
reasonably required by the underwriter. If any Shareholder of Registrable
Securities disapproves the terms of the underwriting, such Shareholder may elect
to withdraw all its Registrable Securities by written notice to the Company, the
managing underwriter and the Shareholder Representative.

          (d)  In the event that, pursuant to Section 6.10 of the Merger
Agreement, the issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger is registered
under the Securities Act on Form S-4, the registration otherwise required by
this Section 2.1 may be accomplished by providing for the resales required to be
registered pursuant to this Section 2.1 in the prospectus included in the
Form S-4. In such event, (a) such prospectus may not be used for resales until
the 181st calendar day following the Effective Time and the use thereof for
resales thereafter shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
provided for herein, (b) no public resales may be made pursuant to Rule 145(d)
under the Securities Act, or otherwise (other than pursuant to a Public Offering
in which Shareholders participate under Section 2.4) until the 181st calendar
day following the Effective Time, and (c) any public resales pursuant to Rule
145(d) or otherwise during the twelve month period specified in Section 2.6
(other than pursuant to a Public Offering requested pursuant Section 2.1 or in
which Shareholders participate under Section 2.4) shall be subject to the volume
limitations specified in Section 2.6.

          2.2  Limit on Demand.  The Company shall not be required to permit the
               ---------------
use of the shelf Registration Statement to effect any Public Offering pursuant
to Section 2.1 after one Demand requested by the Shareholders pursuant to
Section 2.1 shall have been effected.

          2.3  Effective Distribution.  A Public Offering requested pursuant to
               ----------------------
Section 2.1 shall not be deemed to be effected (a) if such Public Offering is
interfered with for any reason by any stop order, injunction or other order or
requirement of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or as a
result of the initiation of any  proceeding for such a stop order by the
Commission through no fault of the Shareholders or the Shareholder
Representative and the result of such interference is to prevent the

                                       4
<PAGE>

Shareholders from disposing of such Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
in accordance with the intended methods of disposition, or (b) if the conditions
to closing specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered
into in connection with any underwritten offering shall not be satisfied or
waived with the consent of the Shareholder Representative, other than as a
result of any breach by the Shareholder Representative or any underwriter of its
obligations thereunder or hereunder.

          2.4  "Piggy-Back" Rights.  If the Company proposes to register any
               -------------------
shares of Common Stock for itself or any of its stockholders (the "Existing
                                                                   --------
Holders") under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-1, Form
-------
S-2 or Form S-3 (or an equivalent general registration form then in effect) for
purposes of a Public Offering of such shares, the Company shall give written
notice of such proposal at least ten (10) business days before the anticipated
filing date, which notice shall include the intended method of distribution of
such shares, to the Shareholder Representative.  Such notice shall specify at a
minimum the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be registered, the
proposed filing date of such Registration Statement, any proposed means of
distribution of such shares and the proposed managing underwriter, if any.
Subject to Section 2.6, upon the written request of any Shareholder given within
five business days after the receipt of any such written notice by facsimile
confirmed by mail (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Shareholder), the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to include in such Public Offering the
Registrable Securities referred to in the Shareholder's request; provided,
                                                                 --------
however, that any participation in such Public Offering by any Shareholder shall
-------
be on substantially the same terms as the Company's (or its other stockholders')
participation therein; and provided further that the amount of Registrable
                           -------- -------
Securities to be included in any such Public Offering shall not exceed the
maximum number which the managing underwriter of such Public Offering considers
in its reasonable commercial judgment to be appropriate based on market
conditions and other relevant factors (the "Maximum Number").  The Shareholders
                                            --------------
shall have the right to withdraw a request to include Registrable Securities in
any Public Offering pursuant to this Section 2.4 by giving written notice to the
Company of its election to withdraw such request at least two (2) business days
prior to the proposed effective date of such Registration Statement.  In
connection with any exercise of rights under this Section 2.4, the registration
under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities to be included therein
may be by means of the shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section
2.1, rather than a separate registration statement filed to register the shares
to be sold for the account of the Company or any Existing Holders, so long as
the rights of the Shareholders to participate in the Public Offering being
effected under Section 2.4 are not thereby prejudiced or impaired in any
material respect.

          2.5  Allocation of Securities Included in a Public Offering.  If the
               ------------------------------------------------------
lead managing underwriter for any Public Offering to be effected pursuant to
Section 2.4 of this Agreement shall advise the Shareholder Representative in
writing that the number of shares of Common Stock sought to be included in such
Public Offering (including those sought to be offered by the Company and those
sought to be offered by the Shareholders)

                                       5
<PAGE>

is more than the Maximum Number, the shares of Common Stock to be included in
such Public Offering shall be allocated pursuant to the following procedures:
first, the Company shall be entitled to include all of the securities that it
has proposed to include, and then, to the extent that any other securities may
be included without exceeding the Maximum Number, the number of Registrable
Securities that will be included in such Registration Statement shall be
allocated among all Shareholders requesting such registration in proportion (as
nearly as practicable) to the amount of Registrable Securities owned by each
requesting Shareholder at the time of filing the Registration Statement.

          2.6  Sale Restrictions.  Other than pursuant to a Public Offering
               -----------------
requested pursuant to Section 2.1 or in which Shareholders participate under
Section 2.4, during the twelve (12) month period starting on the 181st day
following the Effective Time, the Shareholders shall not be permitted to sell,
pursuant to the shelf Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 144, in the
aggregate, more than 1,000,000 Shares during any period of 90 consecutive days
of such twelve month period (the "90 Day Restriction Periods").  Each
                                  --------------------------
Shareholder will be entitled to sell on any given day a number of shares equal
to the number of shares which such Shareholder has notified the Shareholder
Representative such Shareholder desires to sell, provided however, that if
                                                 -------- -------
Shareholders desire to sell more shares than is permitted by the limitation
described above, then each Shareholder desiring to sell Shares that day will
have the number of shares they may sell reduced pro rata based on the number of
shares they requested to sell.

          2.7  Lock-Up Agreement.  It shall be a condition to each Shareholder's
               -----------------
participation in any Public Offering pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.4,
that such Shareholder agrees to execute and deliver to the underwriter or
underwriters for such offering a customary lock-up agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the underwriter, providing for a lock-up of
the Registrable Securities of each such Shareholder for a period of up to 90
days after the closing of the relevant offering.

                                  ARTICLE III
                           OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY

          3.1  (a)  The Company shall (i) prepare and file with the Commission
such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be reasonably necessary to make

provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition
of all securities proposed to be registered pursuant to such Registration
Statement for the period specified in that Section 2.1; and (ii) take all such
other action either necessary or desirable to permit the shares of Registrable
Securities held by the Shareholders to be registered and disposed of in
accordance with the method of disposition described herein.

          (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company may, upon written notice to the Shareholders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to
Section 2.1, suspend such

                                       6
<PAGE>

Shareholders' use of any prospectus which is a part of the shelf Registration
Statement if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Company, the Company
possesses material nonpublic information, including information concerning it or
its business or affairs or information concerning the pursuit of a merger,
disposition or similar transaction, and the Company determines in good faith
that disclosure would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole or would materially adversely affect the ability
to consummate such merger, disposition or similar transaction; provided that
                                                               --------
the Company may not suspend any such sales for more than an aggregate of sixty
(60) consecutive days or for an aggregate of one hundred twenty (120) days (a
"Blackout Period") in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. Upon the
 ---------------
termination of the condition described above, the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Shareholders whose Registrable Securities are included in the
shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any suspension of
sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit
registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c)  In connection with any Registration Statement, the following
provisions shall apply:

          (1)  The Company shall furnish to the Shareholder Representative,
     prior to the filing thereof with the Commission, a copy of any Registration
     Statement, and each amendment thereof and each amendment or supplement, if

     Representative, the managing underwriters, and their respective counsel, if
     any, a reasonable opportunity within a reasonable time period to review and
     comment on copies of all such documents (including a reasonable opportunity
     to review copies of any documents to be incorporated by reference therein
     and all exhibits thereto) proposed to be filed.

          (2)  The Company shall take such action as may be necessary so that:
     (i) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any Prospectus
     forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto (and each
     report or other document incorporated therein by reference) complies in all
     material respects with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
     respective rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Registration
     Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective,
     contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
     fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
     therein not misleading, and (iii) any Prospectus forming part of any
     Registration Statement, and any amendment or supplement to such Prospectus,
     does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
     material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
     light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (3)  (A) The Company shall advise the Shareholders and the Shareholder
     Representative and, if requested by the Shareholders and the Shareholder
     Representative, confirm such advice in writing:

                                       7
<PAGE>

               (i)   when a Registration Statement and any amendment thereto has
          been filed with the Commission and when the Registration Statement or
          any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; and

               (ii)  of any request by the Commission for amendments or
          supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus included
          therein or for additional information related thereto.

          (B)  The Company shall advise the Shareholders and the Shareholder
     Representative and, if requested by any Shareholder or the Shareholder
     Representative, confirm such advice in writing of:

               (i)   the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
          effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any
          proceedings for that purpose;

               (ii)  the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect
          to the suspension of the qualification of the securities included
          therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
          proceeding for such purpose; and

               (iii) the happening of any event that requires the making of any
          changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus so that, as of
          such date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not
          contain an untrue statement of a material fact and do not omit to
          state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
          make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the
          light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading
          (which advice shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the
          use of the Prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities until
          the requisite changes have been made).

          (4)  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
     issuance, and if issued to obtain the withdrawal, of any order suspending
     the effectiveness of the Registration Statement relating to such
     Registrable Securities at the earliest possible time.

          (5)  The Company shall furnish to the Shareholders and the Shareholder
     Representative with respect to the Registration Statement relating to such
     Registrable Securities, without charge, such number of copies of such
     Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including
     financial statements and schedules, and all reports, other documents and
     exhibits (including those incorporated by reference) as the Shareholders
     and the Shareholder Representative shall reasonably request.

<PAGE>

          (6)  The Company shall furnish to the Shareholders and the Shareholder
     Representative such number of copies of any Prospectus (including any
     preliminary Prospectus and any amended or supplemented Prospectus) relating
     to such Registrable Securities, in conformity with the requirements of the
     Securities Act, as the Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative may
     reasonably request in order to effect the offering and sale of the shares
     of such Registrable Securities to be offered and sold, but only while the
     Company shall be required under the provisions hereof to cause the
     Registration Statement to remain effective, and the Company consents
     (except during a Blackout Period or event contemplated by Section 3.1(b))
     to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the
     Shareholders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable
     Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
     thereto.

          (7)  To the extent necessary in connection with any offering of
     Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Company
     shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
     Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement under the
     securities or blue sky laws of such states as the Shareholder
     Representative shall reasonably request, maintain any such registration or
     qualification current until the earlier of the sale of the Registrable
     Securities so registered or ninety (90) calendar days subsequent to the
     effective date of the Registration Statement, and do any and all other acts
     and things either reasonably necessary or advisable to enable any
     Shareholder to consummate the public sale or other disposition of the
     Registrable Securities in jurisdictions where such Shareholder desires to
     effect such sales or other disposition; provided that the Company shall not
                                             --------
     be required to take any action that would subject it to the general
     jurisdiction of the courts of any jurisdiction in which it is not so
     subject or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where
     the Company is not so qualified.

          (8)  In connection with any offering of Registrable Securities
     registered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall (x) furnish the
     Shareholders, at the Company's expense, on a timely basis with certificates
     free of any restrictive legends representing ownership of the Registrable
     Securities being sold in such denominations and registered in such names as
     the Shareholders shall request and (y) instruct the transfer agent and
     registrar of the Registrable Securities to release any stop transfer orders
     with respect to the Registrable Securities.

          (9)  Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
     3.1(c)(3)(B)(iii) above, the Company shall promptly prepare a post-
     effective amendment to any Registration Statement or an amendment or
     supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so
     that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities
     included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
     statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading.  If the Company

                                       9
<PAGE>

     notifies the Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative of the
     occurrence of any Blackout Period or any event contemplated by Section
     3.1(b) above, the Shareholders shall suspend the use of the Prospectus, for
     a period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days in accordance with Section
     3.1(b), until the requisite changes to the Prospectus have been made.

          (10) The Company shall make generally available to its security
     holders or otherwise provide in accordance with Section 11(a) of the
     Securities Act as soon as practicable after the effective date of the
     applicable Registration Statement an earnings statement satisfying the
     provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.

          (11) The Company shall, if requested, promptly include or incorporate
     in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
     Statement, such information as the managing underwriters administering an
     underwritten offering of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder
     reasonably request to be included therein and to which the Company does not
     reasonably object and shall make all required filings of such Prospectus
     supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after they
     are notified of the matters to be included or incorporated in such
     Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment.

          (12) If requested in connection with a Public Offering pursuant to a
     Demand under Section 2.1(b), the Company shall enter into an underwriting
     agreement with a nationally recognized investment banking firm or firms
     selected as provided in Section 2.1(c) containing representations,
     warranties, indemnities and agreements then customarily included by an
     issuer in underwriting agreements with respect to secondary underwritten
     distributions, and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is
     entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and
     procedures substantially identical to those set forth in Article V (or such
     other provisions and procedures acceptable to the managing underwriters, if
     any) with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to Article V
     and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing
     underwriters for such underwritten offering in order to expedite or
     facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable
     Securities.

          (13) In the event the Shareholder Representative proposes to conduct
     an underwritten Public Offering pursuant to Section 2.1, then the Company
     shall:  (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Shareholder
     Representative and its counsel, any underwriter participating in any
     distribution pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney,
     accountant or other agent retained by the Shareholder Representative or any
     such underwriter, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent
     corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries as
     shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to conduct a "reasonable"
     investigation for purposes of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; (ii)
     cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to make reasonably

                                       10
<PAGE>

     available for inspection all relevant information reasonably requested by
     the Shareholder Representative or any such underwriter, attorney,
     accountant or agent in connection with any such Registration Statement, in
     each case, as is customary for similar due diligence examinations; provided
                                                                        --------
     that any information that is designated in writing by the Company, in good
     faith, as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be
     kept confidential by the Shareholder Representative, such underwriter, or
     any such, attorney, accountant or agent, unless such disclosure is made in
     connection with a court proceeding or required by law, or such information
     becomes available to the public generally or through a third party without
     an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; (iii) obtain opinions of
     counsel to the Company and updates thereof which counsel and opinions (in
     form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing
     underwriters, if any, addressed to the Shareholder Representative and the
     underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in
     opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may
     be reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative and underwriters
     (it being agreed that the matters to be covered by such opinion or written
     statement by such counsel delivered in connection with such opinions shall
     include in customary form, without limitation, as of the date of the
     opinion and as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or most
     recent post-effective amendment thereto, as the case may be, "negative
     assurance" statements to the effect that nothing has come to the attention
     of such counsel that leads them to believe such Registration Statement and
     the Prospectus included therein, as then amended or supplemented, including
     the documents incorporated by reference therein, contain an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state therein a material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading); (iv) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof
     from the independent public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary,
     any other independent public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company
     or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements
     and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration
     Statement), addressed to the Shareholder Representative and the
     underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type
     customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with primary
     underwritten offerings; and (v) deliver such documents and certificates as
     may be reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative and the
     managing underwriters, if any, and with any customary conditions contained
     in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the
     Company.  The foregoing actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of
     this Section 3.01(c)(13) shall be performed at each closing under any
     underwritten offering to the extent required thereunder.

          (14) The Company will ensure that the Registrable Securities are
     admitted for listing on the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange
     or trading system on which the Shares primarily trade on or prior to the
     181/st/ day after the Effective Time.

                                       11
<PAGE>

          (15) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all
     other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration, offering and
     sale of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement
     contemplated hereby and enter into any other customary agreements and take
     such other actions, including participation of senior management in
     "roadshows" as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate
     the disposition of such Registrable Securities in any underwritten offering
     contemplated hereby, and the Company shall secure the participation of its
     senior management for such purposes.

          (d)  With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the Commission which may at any time permit the sale of the
Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees
to:

          (1)  Make and keep public information available, as those terms are
     understood and defined in and interpreted under Rule 144, at all times;

          (2)  During the term of this Agreement, furnish to the Shareholders
     and the Shareholder Representative upon request: (i) a written statement by
     the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule
     144 or (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the
     Company.

                                  ARTICLE IV
                                   EXPENSES

          4.1  Expenses Payable by the Company.  Except as provided in Section
               -------------------------------
4.2 below, all fees and expenses incident to the registration and sale of
Registrable Securities shall be borne by the Company whether or not a
Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective, including, without
limitation, (i) all registration, qualification and filing fees (including,
without limitation, (A) fees with respect to filings required to be made with
the New York Stock Exchange and (B) fees and expenses of compliance with state
securities or blue sky laws (including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company or the underwriters, or both, in
connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities)), (ii)
messenger and delivery expenses, word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of printing certificates for
Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust
Company, printing preliminary Prospectuses, Prospectuses, Prospectus
supplements, including those delivered to or for the account of the Shareholders
and the Shareholder Representative as provided in this Agreement, (iii) fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company, (iv) fees and disbursements of all
independent certified public accountants for the Company (including, without
limitation, the expenses of any "comfort letters" required by or incident to
such performance), (v) Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company so
desires such insurance, (vi) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Company
(including, without limitation, expenses incurred by the Company, its officers,

roadshow, including travel and lodging expenses of such roadshows), and (vii)
the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the quotation or listing of
shares of Common Stock on any securities exchange or automated securities

          4.2  Expenses Payable by the Shareholders.  Each Shareholder shall pay
               ------------------------------------
all underwriting discounts and commissions or broker's commissions incurred in
connection with the sale or other disposition of Registrable Securities for or
on behalf of such Shareholder's account as well as the fees and expenses of the
Shareholder's counsel, the Shareholder Representative and the Shareholder
Representative's counsel.

                                   ARTICLE V
                                INDEMNIFICATION

          5.1  Indemnification by the Company.  The Company shall indemnify and
               ------------------------------
hold harmless each of the Registering Shareholders and their respective
directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and
assigns (each, a "Shareholder Indemnitee," and collectively, the "Shareholder
                  ----------------------                          -----------
Indemnitees") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
-----------
debts, obligations, monetary damages, judgements, fines, fees, penalties,
interest obligations, deficiencies, and expenses, interest, court costs,
reasonable costs of investigators, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, engineers and other expenses, and other
expenses of litigation ("Losses") incurred or suffered in connection with, and
                         ------
any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim
asserted to which any Shareholder Indemnitee may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state securities law or
regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Losses arise out of,
result from or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (b)
any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or other
federal or state securities law applicable to the Company and relating to any
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with such registration.
In addition, the Company will reimburse any Shareholder Indemnitee for any
reasonable investigation, legal or other expenses incurred by such Shareholder
Indemnitee in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be liable
with respect to the portion of any such Loss that (i) arises out of, results
from or is based upon any alleged untrue statement or alleged omission made in
such Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus, or amendment or
supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by the Shareholder Indemnitee specifically for use
therein or (ii) attributable to a Registering Shareholder's (A) use of a
Prospectus after being notified by the Company to suspend use thereof pursuant
to Section 3.1(b) or Section 3.1(c)(3)(B)(iii) above or (B) failure to deliver a
final Prospectus to the Person asserting any losses, claims, damages and
liabilities and judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary

                                       13
<PAGE>

prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, if such material misstatement or omission or alleged
material misstatement or omission was cured in an amended or supplemented
Prospectus prepared by the Company and delivered to the Registering Shareholder
at or prior to the time written confirmation of sale to such Person was required
to be made. The foregoing indemnity will remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Registering
Shareholder, and will survive the transfer of such securities by the Registering
Shareholder.

          5.2  Indemnification by Registering Shareholders.  If a Registering
               -------------------------------------------
Shareholder sells Registrable Securities under a Prospectus that is part of a
Registration Statement, such Registering Shareholder will, severally and not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, any underwriter participating
in the distribution and their respective directors and officers who signed such
Registration Statement and each Person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
(each, a "Controlling Person") under the same circumstances as the foregoing
          ------------------
indemnity from the Company to the Registering Shareholders but only to the
extent that such Losses arise out of or are based upon any untrue or allegedly
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a
material fact that was made in the Prospectus, the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information relating to a Registering Shareholder furnished to the
Company by such Registering Shareholder expressly for use therein.  In no event
will the aggregate liability of a Registering Shareholder exceed the amount of
the net proceeds received by the Registering Shareholder upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.  Such
indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or such officer, director, employee or
Controlling Person, and will survive the transfer of such securities by the
Registering Shareholder.

          5.3  Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in Sections
               ------------
5.1 or 5.2 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold
such indemnified party harmless for any Losses in respect of which any such
Section would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions
provided therein), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses.  Such contribution
will be in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the
other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified
party, on the other hand, will be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material
fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information

                                       14
<PAGE>

supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent any such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of any such Losses will be deemed to include any
investigation, legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding, to the extent such party would
have been indemnified for such expenses if the indemnification provided for in
Sections 5.1 or 5.2 was available to such party. In no event will the aggregate
liability of a Registering Shareholder exceed the amount of the net proceeds
received by the Registering Shareholder upon the sale of the Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

          5.4  Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.  Any Person entitled to
               --------------------------------------
indemnification hereunder will (a) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party
of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification, and (b) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided that the failure to give such
                                       --------
notice shall not relieve an indemnifying party of liability except to the extent
it has been prejudiced as a result.  Any Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in
(but not control) the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel will be at the expense of such Person and not of the indemnifying party
unless (x) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, (y)
the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person within a reasonable period of
time pursuant to this Agreement, or (z) a conflict of interest exists between
such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims that would
make such separate representation required under applicable ethical rules.  In
the case of clause (z) above if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in
writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not have the right to assume the
defense of such claim on behalf of such Person.  If such defense is not assumed
by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld).  No indemnified party will be required to consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term the giving of a release, by all claimants or plaintiffs, to
such indemnified party from all liability with respect to such claim or
litigation.  Any indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to,
assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel (other than required local counsel) for all parties
indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim.

          5.5  Underwriting Agreement Controls.  In the event of any conflict
               -------------------------------
between the indemnification and contribution terms as herein set forth and as
set forth in any underwriting agreement entered pursuant hereto, the
underwriting agreement shall control.

                               OTHER AGREEMENTS

          6.1  Rule 144.  The Company shall file, on a timely basis, all reports
               --------
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and
will take such further action and provide such documents as the Shareholders may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the
Shareholders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the conditions provided by (i) Rule 144
under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii)
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.  Upon the
request of a Shareholder, the Company will deliver to the Shareholder a
statement verifying that it has complied with such information and requirements.

          6.2  Shareholder Representative.  (a) The Shareholders agree to
               --------------------------
appoint one Person to act as their representative, attorney in fact and proxy
with respect to certain matters specified in this Agreement (the "Shareholder
                                                                  -----------
Representative").  The parties have designated Goelet LLC as the initial
--------------
Shareholder Representative.  The Shareholder Representative may resign at any
time, and a Shareholder Representative may be removed at any time by the vote of
Shareholders who collectively own more than 50% of the Registrable Securities at
such time (the "Majority Holders").  In the event of the death, resignation or
                ----------------
removal of the Shareholder Representative, a new Shareholder Representative
shall be appointed by a vote of Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Shareholder
Representative.  Any failure by the Majority Holders to appoint a new
Shareholder Representative upon the death, resignation or removal of the
Shareholder Representative shall not have the effect of releasing the
Shareholders from any liability under this Agreement.

          (b)  The Shareholder Representative shall have such powers and
authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to the
Shareholder Representative under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
                                                 --------  -------
Shareholder Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Shareholders, except as expressly provided herein. The Shareholder
Representative will at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received
from the Majority Holders. The Shareholder Representative shall, at the expense
of the Shareholders, be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as they shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising their powers and performing their function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.

          (c)  The Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to any fee,
commission or other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder,
but shall be entitled to the reimbursement by the Shareholders of all his, her
or its fees and expenses incurred as the Shareholder Representative pursuant to
Section 4.2 hereof.  In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument,
agreement or document relating

                                       16
<PAGE>

hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the
powers conferred upon the Shareholder Representative hereunder, the Shareholder
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any Shareholder by
reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted
hereunder or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct. Each Shareholder shall indemnify, pro rata based upon such holder's
percentage interest, the Shareholder Representative against all losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys', accountants' and other experts' or consultant's fees and the amount
of any judgment against the Shareholder Representative, of any nature
whatsoever, arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation,
challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts or omissions of the Shareholder Representative hereunder.
The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or
proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the Shareholder
Representative hereunder for his or her gross negligence or willful misconduct.
In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from
Shareholder Representative to the Shareholders as to the existence of a
deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each such
holder shall promptly deliver to the Shareholder Representative full payment of
his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency, in accordance with
such Shareholder's percentage interest. In no event shall the Company be
responsible for any reimbursement or indemnification of the Shareholder
Representative.

          (d)  All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Shareholder Representative under this Agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

          (e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Shareholder
hereby acknowledges that the Company shall not have any responsibility or
obligation whatsoever to any such Shareholder or to any other party with respect
to or arising out of any actions taken or any inaction by the Shareholder
Representative.

          (f)  The Company shall have the right to rely conclusively upon all
instructions, requests, consents, elections and other actions taken or omitted
to be taken by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement and any
instrument, agreement or document relating hereto, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon all the Shareholders.

          7.1  Amendments; Waivers.  This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
               -------------------
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or terminated, except upon the
execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the Company and the
Shareholder Representative; provided, however, that the Shareholder
                            --------  -------
Representative shall not amend, modify or supplement this Agreement in a manner
that is detrimental to the

                                       17
<PAGE>

Shareholders without first obtaining the written consent of the Majority Holders
to such amendment, modification or supplement; provided further, however, that

     2.3  Irrevocable Proxy and Power of Attorney.  To facilitate the operation
          ---------------------------------------
of this Agreement, each Shareholder hereby grants to the Shareholder

Shareholder's Shares on all Matters in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof. Such
proxy shall be durable and shall continue in force until terminated in writing
by the Shareholder Representative by notice to the Company and the Shareholders,
and such proxy shall be deemed coupled with an interest. Termination of the
proxy with respect to some or all Shares will not affect any proxy respecting
any other Shares and will not terminate this Agreement. The Shareholder
Representative's exercise of his proxy will extinguish any prior proxy granted
by any Shareholder. The foregoing proxy and power of attorney is intended to be
a durable power of attorney and shall survive, and shall not be affected by, the
subsequent death, incompentency, disability, incapacity, bankruptcy or
termination of any Shareholder and shall bind each Shareholder's heirs, personal
representatives, executors, administrators and assigns.

     2.4  Disposition of Shares.  Until the date which is two years following

          2.4.1  Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Registration Rights
Agreement, including without limitation that no public resales may be made
(other than pursuant to a Public Offering (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement) in which shareholders participate under Section 2.4 of the
Registration Rights Agreement) until the 181st day following the Effective Time
(as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) and that any public resales
during the twelve-month period specified in Section 2.6 of the Registration
Rights Agreement shall be subject to the volume limitations specified in such
Section 2.6; or

          2.4.2  To a Person who (1) upon closing of such transfer will own less
than 5% of the Voting Securities and (2) is not a member of a "group" (within
the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or an Affiliate or an
Associate of a member of such a "group" and (3) has not publicly announced that
he, she or it is accumulating Voting Securities for any of the purposes set
forth in Section 2.1 hereof, provided that as a condition to such transfer, the
Company shall be provided such documentation as it may reasonably request,
including an opinion of counsel, to the effect that such transfer does not
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or any applicable state
securities law.

     2.5  Addition of New Shareholders.  Additional Persons may be added as
          ----------------------------
parties to this Agreement, and will be deemed to have agreed to the provisions
hereof, upon execution and delivery to the Company of a copy of this Standstill
and Voting Agreement executed by such Persons and by delivery to the Company
supplemental forms of Exhibit A, containing as to such Persons the information
                      ---------

be "Shareholders" for all purposes hereof, and the Common Stock identified on
Exhibit A by such Stockholders shall be "Shares" for all purposes hereof, until
terminated as provided herein.

     Section 4.  General.
                 --------

     4.1  Remedies.  Each of the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
          --------
Company would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed by the other parties hereto in accordance with their specific
terms or are otherwise breached, and that money damages alone would not be
easily calculable and would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement.  Accordingly, the Company shall be entitled, without the requirement
of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of
this Agreement by the other parties hereto, in addition to all other remedies

     certificates evidencing whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued in
     consideration therefor, (ii) the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the
     number of shares previously evidenced by the canceled certificate or (iii)
     a combination of clauses (i) and (ii), in each case in accordance with the
     allocation procedures of this Section 3.01 and upon the surrender of the
     certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.03, without
     interest.

          (b)  The aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that will
     be converted into the right to receive Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger
     will be 43,943 (such amount being equal to 50% of the shares of Company
     Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time) (the "Stock Election Number"). The aggregate number of shares of
                 ---------------------
     Company Common Stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash
     in the Merger will be 43,943 (such amount being equal to 50% of the shares
     of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time) (the "Cash Election Number"). In the event that there are
                           --------------------
     Dissenting Shares and the holders of such Dissenting Shares do not, prior
     to the Effective Time, withdraw notice of election to dissent, vote in
     favor of the Merger or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, the Cash
     Election Number shall be reduced by an amount equal to twice the number of
     Dissenting Shares and the Stock Election Number shall be increased by the
     same amount, provided, however that in no such event shall the Cash
                  --------  -------
     Election Number be reduced by more than 8,789.

          (c)  Subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in
     this Section 3.01, each record holder, immediately prior to the Effective
     Time, of Shares will be entitled (i) to elect to receive cash for all of
     the Shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii) to elect to receive shares of
                    -------------
     Purchaser Common Stock for all of the Shares (a "Stock Election"), (iii) to
                                                      --------------
     elect to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock for part of the holder's
     Shares and cash for the remaining part of the holder's Shares (a "Mixed
                                                                       -----
     Election"), or (iv) to indicate that the record holder has no preference as
     --------
     to the receipt of cash or Purchaser Common Stock for the shares (a "Non-
                                                                         ---
     Election"). All elections shall be made on a form designed for that purpose
     --------
     (a "Form of Election"). A holder of record of Shares who holds Shares as
         ----------------
     trustee, nominee, or in another representative capacity (a "Stock
                                                                 -----
     Representative"), may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that the
     --------------                                           --------
     Stock Representative certifies that each Form of Election covers all the
     Shares held by the Stock Representative for a particular beneficial owner.

     (d)  If the aggregate number of Shares covered by Cash Elections (the "Cash
                                                                            ----
     Election Shares") exceeds the Cash Election Number, all Shares covered by
     ---------------
     Stock Elections (the "Stock Election Shares") and all Shares covered by
                           ---------------------
     Non-Elections (the "Non-Election Shares") shall be converted into the right
                         -------------------
     to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and the Cash Election Shares
     shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Purchaser Common
     Stock and cash in the following manner: each Cash Election Share shall be
     converted into the right to receive (i) cash equal to the

                                       15
<PAGE>

     product of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount and (B) a fraction (the "Cash
                                                                       ----
     Fraction") the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number and the
     --------
     denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and
     (ii) a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product of
     (A) the Common Conversion Number and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the
     Cash Fraction.

          (e)  If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds the
     Stock Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares
     shall be converted into the right to receive cash, and the Stock Election
     Shares shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Purchaser
     Common Stock and cash in the following manner: each Stock Election Share
     shall be converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares of
     Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Common Conversion
     Number and (B) a fraction (the "Stock Fraction") the numerator of which
                                     --------------
     shall be the Stock Election Number and the denominator of which shall be
     the total number of Stock Election Shares and (ii) cash equal to the
     product of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount and (B) a fraction equal to one
     minus the Stock Fraction.

          (f)  With respect to each holder of Company Common Stock who makes a
     Mixed Election, the Shares the holder elects to be converted into the right
     to receive cash shall be treated as Cash Election Shares for purposes of
     this Section 3.01 and the shares the holder elects to be converted into the
     right to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be treated as Stock
     Election Shares for purposes of this Section 3.01.

          (g)  In the event that neither Section 3.01(d) nor Section 3.01(e)
     above is applicable, all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
     right to receive cash, all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
     the right to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and the Non-Election
     Shares, if any, shall be converted into the right to receive shares of
     Purchaser Common Stock and cash in the following manner: each Non-Election
     Share shall be converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares
     of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Common Conversion
     Number and (B) a fraction (the "Non-Election Fraction"), the numerator of
                                     ---------------------
     which shall be the excess of the Stock Election Number over the total
     number of Stock Election Shares and the denominator of which shall be the
     excess of (x) 87,886 over (y) the sum of the total number of Stock Election
     Shares and the total number of Cash Election Shares, (ii) an amount in
     cash, without interest, equal to the product of the Per Share Cash Amount
     and (iii) a fraction equal to one minus the Non-Election Fraction.

          (h)  If either (i) the tax opinion of Shearman & Sterling referred to
     in Section 9.02(c) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by Shearman
     & Sterling and concurred in by Baker Botts L.L.P.) or (ii) the tax opinion
     of Baker Botts L.L.P. referred to in Section 9.03(c) cannot be rendered (as
     reasonably determined by Baker Botts, L.L.P. and concurred in by Shearman &
     Sterling), in either case as a result of the Merger potentially failing to
     satisfy continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income
     tax principles relating to reorganizations under section 368(a) of the
     Code, then the Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to elect
     to restructure the transaction as a taxable sale of Company Common Stock
     (or, at the Company's

                                       16
<PAGE>

     option, as a reverse subsidiary merger treated for federal income tax
     purposes as a taxable sale of Company Common Stock). The parties confirm
     their understanding that, under the Law as in effect on the date hereof,
     the continuity of interest requirement, under applicable federal income tax
     principles, shall be considered to be satisfied if at least 40% in value of
     the sum of the Merger Consideration plus any other amount treated for
     federal income tax purposes as consideration provided by the Purchaser or a
     related party for the Shares constitutes shares of Purchaser Common Stock,
     valued in accordance with the relevant federal income tax principles. In
     the event that the Company elects the option to restructure the transaction
     as a taxable sale of Company Common Stock (or as a taxable reverse
     subsidiary merger) pursuant to this Subsection, the provisions of this
     Agreement shall be applied to the transaction as if that transaction were
     the Merger, except where the provision refers to section 368 of the Code or
     clearly contemplates that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
     reorganization within the meaning of section 368.

          (i)  To be effective, a Form of Election must be properly completed,
     signed and submitted to the Purchaser's transfer agent and registrar, as
     paying agent (the "Paying Agent"), and accompanied by certificates
                        ------------
     representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Certificates") as
                                                       --------------------
     to which the election is being made. The Purchaser shall have the
     discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Paying Agent,
     to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed
     and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of
     Election. The decision of the Purchaser (or the Paying Agent) in these
     matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither the Purchaser nor the
     Paying Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
     defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Paying Agent. The Paying
     Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by this Section
     3.01(i), and all these computations shall be conclusive and binding on the
     holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

          (j)  For the purposes of this Agreement, a holder of shares of Company
     Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election that is received by the
     Paying Agent prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made a
     Non-Election. If the Purchaser or the Paying Agent shall determine that any
     purported Cash Election or Stock Election was not properly made, the shares
     subject to improperly made Cash Election or Stock Election shall be treated
     as Non-Election Shares.

          (k)  Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall use its best efforts
     to cause copies of the Form of Election to be mailed to the record holders
     of Company Common Stock not less than 20 days prior to the Effective Time.
     A Form of Election must be received by the Paying Agent by 5:00 p.m., New
     York City time, on the Business Day that is immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (the "Election Deadline"), in order to be effective. All
                          -----------------
     elections may be revoked until the Election Deadline in writing by the
     record holders submitting Forms of Election.

          (l)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.01 or in
     any Form of Election to the contrary, unless the Company shall provide a
     written notice to the Purchaser and to each holder of Shares stating that
     the Board of Directors of the

                                       17
<PAGE>

     Company has determined to permit holders of Shares to make individual
     elections, each and every holder of Shares shall automatically be deemed to
     have submitted a Mixed Election indicating that such holder elects to
     receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock for 50% of such holder's Shares
     and cash for 50% of such holder's Shares.

          (m)  Each share of Purchaser Common Stock issued to holders of Company
     Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be issued with an associated Right
     (as defined in the Rights Agreement dated as of April 26, 1994 between the
     Purchaser and Harris Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent (the
     "Rights Agreement")). Purchaser shall supplement the Rights Agreement to
      ----------------
     provide that no Shareholder will be an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in
     the Rights Agreement) by virtue of acquiring Purchaser Common Stock in the
     Merger unless or until it or any of its "Affiliates" or "Associates" (as
     defined in the Rights Agreement) shall purchase or otherwise become the
     "Beneficial Owner" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of additional
     Shares of Purchaser Common Stock or any other Person or Persons who is (or
     collectively are) the Beneficial Owners of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
     shall become an Affiliate or Associate of such Shareholder unless, in
     either such case, such Shareholder, together with all Affiliates or
     Associates of such Shareholder, is not then the Beneficial Owner of 20% or
     more of the Purchaser Common Stock then outstanding.

          SECTION 3.02.  Cancellation of Treasury Shares.  Each share of Company
                         -------------------------------
Common Stock held in the Company treasury immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

          SECTION 3.03   Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures.  (a)  Subject to
                         -----------------------------------
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at or prior to the Effective Time,
the Purchaser shall appoint an exchange agent that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), to effect the exchange of Shares for shares
                  --------------
of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in accordance with the provisions of this
Article III. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates representing shares
of Purchaser Common Stock (the "Purchaser Certificates"), and cash in amounts
                                ----------------------
sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of the Purchaser
Certificates and cash in exchange for the Company Certificates in connection
with the Merger, as contemplated by this Article III, and any cash payable in
respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.05 (the "Exchange
                                                                   --------
Fund").
----

          (b)  The Purchaser shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, (i) a Transmittal Letter (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to shares of
Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon the delivery of a Company Certificate
or Company Certificates representing those shares to the Exchange Agent, and
which letter shall otherwise be in the form and have the other provisions as the
Purchaser shall reasonably specify, which form shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates for

                                       18
<PAGE>

(x) Purchaser Certificates to which the holder of shares of Company Common Stock
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a), (y) the cash to which the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a), and (z)
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any (the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
and cash described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above being referred to
collectively as the "Merger Consideration"). Commencing immediately after the
                     --------------------
Effective Time, upon the surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company
Certificate, together with a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal
and all other documents and other materials reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent to be delivered in connection therewith, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock which immediately prior to the Effective Time were represented by
the Company Certificate so surrendered shall have been converted in accordance
with the provisions of Section 3.01, together with a cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 3.05. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable, if any, upon surrender of the Company
Certificate. Unless and until any Company Certificate is so surrendered, no
dividends or other distributions, if any, payable to the holders of record of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock, as of any date subsequent to the Effective
Time, shall be paid to the holder of the Company Certificate in respect thereof.
Upon the surrender of any Company Certificate, the record holder of the
Purchaser Certificate or Purchaser Certificates representing shares of Purchaser
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, if any, shall be entitled to receive,
(i) at the time of surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
in respect of shares of Purchaser Common Stock having a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to the surrender date, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions in
respect of shares of Purchaser Common Stock having a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to the date of surrender. No
interest shall be payable in respect of the payment of dividends or
distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

          (c)  The Purchaser or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration, and from any dividends or other
distributions which the holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.03(b), such amounts that the Purchaser or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code and/or any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign law.

          SECTION 3.04.  Transfer Books.  All shares of Purchaser Common Stock
                         --------------
issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

          SECTION 3.05.  No Fractional Share Certificates.  No fraction of a
                         --------------------------------
share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof, each
Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock shall, upon surrender of the shares of Company Common
Stock to the Exchange Agent, be paid an amount in cash by the Exchange Agent
(without interest) equal to the value of such fraction of a share based upon the
closing price of Purchaser Common Stock at the Effective Time. Promptly after
the determination of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall send by mail, postage prepaid, to
each such holder a check payable to such holder for the amount of cash payable
in lieu of such holder's fractional interests.

<PAGE>

          SECTION 3.06.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event
                         --------------------------------------
any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, which shall be accompanied by an
indemnity bond or other security or indemnity acceptable to the Purchaser, of
that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Purchaser Common Stock and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled.

          SECTION 3.07.  Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the
                         ----------------------------
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Purchaser upon demand, and each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore surrendered the holder's Company
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Purchaser for satisfaction of the holder's Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with
Section 3.03(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Purchaser, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any shares or amounts properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

          SECTION 3.08.  Certain Adjustments.  If, in the period between the
                         -------------------
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Purchaser Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or
other securities by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Purchaser Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change
with respect to Purchaser Common Stock, the Common Conversion Number and the
Cash Election Number and the form of securities issuable in the Merger shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

          SECTION 3.09.  Restricted Securities.  The parties acknowledge that
                         ---------------------
the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Article III
and pursuant to Section 8.07 shall not have been registered and shall be
characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities laws, and,
under such laws, such shares may be resold without registration under the
Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. Each certificate
evidencing shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Article III shall bear the following legend:

               "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED
               FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
               ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT").  SUCH SHARES MAY
               NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
               REGISTRATION WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN
               OPINION OF LEGAL COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO

               THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED."

          SECTION 3.10.  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  The
                         ------------------------------------------
parties hereto shall take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger, and the transactions
contemplated hereby, as promptly as possible.

          SECTION 3.11.  Dissenters' Rights.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision
                         ------------------
of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
Persons who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing payment of the fair
market value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the BCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent
                    -----------------
the right to receive shares of Purchaser Common Stock or cash as provided in
this Agreement. Such Persons shall be entitled to receive payment from the
Surviving Corporation of the fair market value of such shares of Company Common
Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of the BCL, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by Shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares under the BCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and
to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
Purchaser Common Stock and/or cash as provided herein, upon surrender in the
manner provided in Section 3.01, of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.

          (b)  The Company shall give to the Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to the BCL and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for payment of fair market value under the BCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, make any payment with
respect to any such demands, or offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.
Any amount payable to any Person exercising dissenters' rights shall be paid
solely by the Surviving Corporation out of its own funds.

          SECTION 3.12.  Purchase Price Adjustment.  (a)  The Per Share Cash
                         -------------------------
Amount and the Common Conversion Number will be adjusted on the Closing Date as
described below.

          (b)  The Company shall provide to the Purchaser three business days
before the Closing Date a Closing Statement stating, as of the Closing Date: (i)
the Company Long-Term Debt, (ii) the Unpaid Company Transaction Fees, (iii) the
Unpaid Severance, Retention and Phantom Share Costs, (iv) the NORIC Cash and (v)
Company dividends paid since September 30, 2000, accompanied by reasonable

     performed, would not be permitted under this subsection (v); or

          (vi)   enter into a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other

     in the event that the Purchaser becomes the subject of an unsolicited
     tender offer or exchange offer, or any third party publicly announces a
     Competing Transaction (as defined in Section 6.09) which was not solicited
     by the Purchaser, the Purchaser may enter into a merger, consolidation,
     share exchange or other business combination transaction, with a Person

the date hereof until the Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall,

the Company Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, agents,

solicitation and/or information materials in connection with such meeting so as
to comply with applicable Law, including Regulation D under the Securities Act,
and the Company will include in such materials all information the Purchaser

          SECTION 6.05.   Purchaser Stockholders' Meeting. (a) The Purchaser
                          -------------------------------
shall call and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the "Purchaser
                                                                ---------

---------------------
upon (i) the approval and (ii) the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and
the approval of the issuance of shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the

prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Purchaser
                                     ---------------
Stockholders' Meeting. The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the Purchaser to vote in favor of (i) the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) the Purchaser Stock Issuance;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Purchaser may, at any time
--------  -------
prior to the Purchaser Stockholders' Meeting, withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation to the extent the Board of Directors of the Purchaser determines
in good faith after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the
Purchaser's regular outside counsel) that such action is required by reason of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Purchaser to the
Purchaser's stockholders under applicable Law.

          (b)    Subject to the proviso to the last sentence of Section 6.05(a),

cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
Governmental

Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations
or orders required to be obtained or made by the Purchaser or the Company or any
of their subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions with respect to this

more than ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof) notifications under the

requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and shall
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from
any State Attorney General or other Governmental Authority in connection with
antitrust matters. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings or responses, including providing copies of
all such documents to the other party and its advisors prior to filing or
responding.

          SECTION 6.07.   Notice of Certain Matters. The Purchaser shall give
                          -------------------------
prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the
Purchaser, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause (i) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied, and (b) any failure of the Purchaser or the Company, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

          SECTION 6.08.   Non-Accredited Investor Advisor. Prior to the Company
                          -------------------------------
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall engage a qualified person or persons to
serve as a representative to advise those Shareholders who are not accredited
investors (as defined in Section 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act) on their rights in connection with and the risks associated with
their investment in shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

          SECTION 6.09.   No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) The Company, each
                          -------------------------------
Shareholder and the Purchaser each agree that, for a period of time from the
date hereof until the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.01 hereof, such party will not, directly or
indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent or
otherwise, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals that
constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction (as defined below) or (ii) agree to, enter into, accept, approve or
recommend any Competing Transaction, or enter into or conduct any negotiations
in respect thereof. Unless precluded by a confidentiality agreement in
connection with an unsolicited proposal, the Company or any Shareholder, on the
one hand, will notify the Purchaser, on the other hand, or the Purchaser, on the
one hand, shall notify the Company, on the other hand, of any proposal of a
Competing Transaction or any request for information in connection with any
Competing Transaction or

                                       48
<PAGE>

for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or the Purchaser
by any person or entity that informs the Company or the Purchaser that it is
considering making, or has made, any proposal of a Competing Transaction. Such
notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, inquiry or contact. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Board of Directors of the Purchaser from furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in connection with an
unsolicited proposal by such Person to acquire the Purchaser pursuant to any
Competing Transaction, if, and only to the extent that, (i) the Board of
Directors of Purchaser, after consultation with independent legal counsel (who
may be such party's regularly engaged independent legal counsel), determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would cause the Board of
Directors to breach its fiduciary duties to its stockholders imposed by
applicable Law and (ii) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, such party uses its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement on customary terms. In addition, in circumstances in which Purchaser's
Board of Directors has received a bona fide unsolicited proposal with respect to
a Competing Transaction which the Purchaser's Board of Directors has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, creates a
substantial risk that the Merger will not be consummated, and Purchaser's Board
of Directors determines in good faith that taking such action is an appropriate
response to such proposal and is required by its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, Purchaser may solicit or initiate discussions with a Person
other than the Person who made such unsolicited proposal, and enter into
discussions or negotiations with such other Person.

          (b)  A "Competing Transaction" means any of the following involving
                  ---------------------
the Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be (other than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction; (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of the
assets of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) a tender
offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
such party; or (iv) in the case of the Purchaser, any solicitation in opposition
to approval of the Merger or the issuance of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger.

          SECTION 6.10.   Registration. If the Purchaser so elects by giving
                          ------------
written notice to the Company, or in the event that the issuance of Purchaser
Common Stock in the Merger is determined not to be exempt from registration
under the Securities Act (a "Private Placement") in the reasonable judgment of
                             -----------------
the Company or the Purchaser in reliance upon the advice of counsel, (a) the
Purchaser as promptly as practicable will prepare and file with the SEC a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Merger S-4") with respect to the Merger
                                         ----------
and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger S-4 to become effective, (b)
the Company will cooperate with the Purchaser in the preparation of the Merger
S-4 and use its reasonable best efforts to assist and facilitate such filing and
declaration of effectiveness, and (c) the parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the consummation of
the Merger notwithstanding the inability or failure to achieve a Private
Placement, including negotiating expeditiously and in good faith with respect to
any and all amendments to this Agreement necessary or appropriate to permit
consummation of the Merger.

          SECTION 6.11.  Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.
                         ------------------------------------------------------
(a) The indemnification provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each subsidiary thereof shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall
be required by Law.

          (b)    In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, or at its option,
the Purchaser, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

          (c)    For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall maintain in effect the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(provided that the Purchaser may substitute therefor policies of at least the
 --------
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the
Effective Time.

          SECTION 6.12.  Plan of Reorganization. (a) This Agreement is intended
                         ----------------------
to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-
2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after
the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and no party
hereto will knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure
to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under the
provisions of section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither
the Purchaser nor any of its affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken, which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code.

          (b)    As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason
(i) why it would not be able to deliver to Baker Botts, L.L.P. or Shearman &
Sterling, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below, certificates
substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with
customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firms to deliver
the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(c), or (ii) why
Baker Botts, L.L.P. or Shearman & Sterling would not be able to deliver the
opinions required by Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(c).

          (c)    As of the date hereof, the Purchaser does not know of any
reason (i) why it would not be able to deliver to Baker Botts, L.L.P. or
Shearman & Sterling, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below,
certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such
firms to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 9.02(c) and
9.03(c), or (ii) why

                                       50
<PAGE>

Baker Botts, L.L.P. or Shearman & Sterling would not be able to deliver the
opinions required by Sections 9.02(c) and 9.03(c).

          SECTION 6.13.  Other Shareholders. (a) Subject to the terms and
                         ------------------
conditions hereof, until the Closing Date, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all holders of Shares that are not
parties hereto to become parties to this Agreement prior to the Closing, and to
agree to be bound by all provisions hereof applicable to the Shareholders,
including the obligation to indemnify the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons
pursuant to Article X, by executing and delivering to the Company an irrevocable
consent to be bound by the provisions of, and to become a party to, this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.13 (a "Joinder Agreement").
                                                           -----------------
By executing and delivering to the Company a completed Joinder Agreement, a
holder of Shares shall be deemed to be a "Shareholder" party hereto, and shall
be bound by all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by
the Shareholders hereunder, as if such holder was an original party hereto. Each
holder of Shares that is not a party hereto and that desires to exchange all of
such holder's Shares upon the terms and conditions set forth herein will be
entitled to become a party to this Agreement prior to the Closing by complying
with the provisions of this Section 6.13 and will not be subject to any escrow
requirements under this Agreement.

          (b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, 10% of
the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and/or cash to be delivered at the Closing
to each holder of Shares that does not, prior to the Closing, execute and
deliver to the Company a Joinder Agreement, shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent as provided in Section 3.13.

          SECTION 6.14.  Phantom Stock Plan and Severance Payments. The parties
                         -----------------------------------------
acknowledge that the Merger will constitute a Change of Control, as that term is
defined in the Phantom Share Plan, as amended, in the Severance Pay Plan, the
Severance Agreement, and in the Retention Bonus Plan instituted by North Central
(collectively, the "Phantom Stock and Severance Plans"). The board of directors
                    ---------------------------------
of NCOC has determined that Section 4.15(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the correct methodology for computing the amount to be paid for Phantom
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Phantom Share Plan. Except with respect to
payments under the Severance Pay Plan and Severance Agreement to employees of
North Central designated by Purchaser in writing at least five days prior to the
closing, all payments required by a Change of Control under the terms of the
Phantom Stock and Severance Plans shall be made by North Central immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In order to fund such payments, the Company and/or
one or more of the Non-Energy Company Subsidiaries shall lend or contribute the
required funds to North Central prior to the time that North Central is required
to make such payments or North Central will borrow such funds pursuant to the
NCOC revolving credit facility.

          SECTION 6.15.  No Trading. Each Shareholder covenants and agrees
                         ----------
that, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, neither such
Shareholder nor any Affiliate or Associate of such Shareholder will buy or sell
any Shares of Purchaser Common Stock, including any short sale, or any option,
warrant on or other derivative security with respect to Purchaser Common Stock.

          SECTION 6.16.  Standstill and Voting Agreement. As of the Effective
                         -------------------------------
Time, each of the Shareholders (or the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of
the Shareholders) shall execute and deliver to the Purchaser the Standstill and
Voting Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

          SECTION 7.01.   Compensation and Benefits; Service Recognition. (a)
                          ----------------------------------------------
Effective upon the Effective Time, employees of North Central who continue as
employees of North Central following the Merger shall be afforded the right to
participate in employee welfare, pension and savings plans on the same basis as
similarly situated employees of Purchaser; provided, however, that changes may
                                           --------  -------
be made to such employee benefit plans to the extent necessary to comply with
applicable Law.

          (b)    For the period of time that the terms and conditions of the
Severance Plan and Severance Agreements are in full force and effect, the
Purchaser shall maintain, and cause its subsidiaries to maintain, welfare plans
which in the aggregate will provide a level of benefits for former employees
covered by such severance arrangements that are at least as favorable to
participants as those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that changes may be made to such employee benefit plans to
--------  -------
the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law.

          (c)    For the purposes of the welfare benefits described in Sections
7.01(b) of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall provide, or cause its
subsidiaries to provide, such welfare benefits at a cost to employees or former
employees in a ratio at least as favorable to participants as the ratio of
employee contributions to employer contributions in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

          (d)    For a period of two years following the Effective Time or until
an earlier termination of employment, the Purchaser shall ensure, and cause its
subsidiaries to ensure, that each individual employed by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall continue to be paid
after the Effective Time a base salary at no lower a rate than in effect
immediately before the Effective Time.

          (e)    The Purchaser shall maintain, and cause its subsidiaries to
maintain, the Severance Plan in effect as of the Effective Time for a period of
one year after the Effective Time; provided, however, that, if the Purchaser
                                   --------  -------
desires to amend or modify such plan, no such amendment or modification may
adversely impair the rights of any participant under the plan without his
consent.

          (f)    Anything above to the contrary notwithstanding, as of the
Effective Time, in the event that a "Change of Control," as defined in the
following described agreements and plans, occurs and a payment is due to any
employee or participant, the Company agrees to make such payments, or to cause
North Central to make such payments to the employee or participant, on the
effective date of Change of Control or the Effective Time, whichever is earlier,
and to the extent such payments are not made by the Company or North Central,
the Purchaser agrees to assume and honor the following arrangements and payments
thereunder for

                                       52
<PAGE>

employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiary relating to a Change in
Control in accordance with the terms of the relevant plans or agreements as they
existed immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Severance Plan, as
amended, (ii) the Severance Agreements dated as of June 1, 2000 with Messrs.
Winne, Becci, Deupree and Beckham and (iii) the Retention Bonus Plan dated June
1, 2000, as revised. If the Purchaser desires to amend such plans, agreements or
letters after the Effective Time, no such amendment shall be made if it
adversely impairs the rights of any affected employee, unless the employee's
consent is obtained.

          (g)  To the extent service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
participation or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by the Purchaser or its subsidiaries for the benefit
of employees of the Purchaser or its subsidiaries, the employees of the Company
shall be credited for service accrued prior to the Effective Time with the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

          (h)  The current and former employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of this Article VII, and may
enforce its provisions in the same manner as if they were signatories to this
Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE VIII
                                  TAX MATTERS

          SECTION 8.01.   Indemnity.  (a)  The Shareholders agree to indemnify
                          ---------
the Purchaser against all Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or
of any member of any affiliated group with which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary files or has previously filed a consolidated or combined income tax
return, with respect to any period or portion thereof (i) insofar as such Taxes
are attributable to North Central, that ends on or before the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) insofar as such Taxes are attributable to the Company and
the Non-Energy Company Subsidiaries, that ends immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Shareholder Tax Periods"). The Purchaser
                                   -----------------------
agrees to indemnify the Shareholders against all Taxes for periods or portions
thereof (collectively, the "Purchaser Tax Periods") which are not included in
                            ---------------------
the Shareholder Tax Periods. Estimated Taxes paid on or before the end of a
Shareholder Tax Period shall be treated as a payment of Taxes with respect to
such period.

          (b)  With respect to any Tax that is payable with respect to a taxable
period that is included in both the Shareholder Tax Periods and the Purchaser
Tax Periods, the portion of any such Tax allocable to the Shareholder Tax
Periods shall be deemed to equal: (i) in the case of Taxes that are based upon
or related to income or receipts, the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the last date included in the Shareholder Tax Periods;
and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the
level of any item, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending with the last date included in the Shareholder Tax Periods and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

                                       53

          SECTION 8.02.   Tax Returns and Payments.  (a)  From the date of this
                          ------------------------
Agreement through and after the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall prepare and
submit to the Purchaser for filing or otherwise furnish to the appropriate party
(or cause to be prepared and submitted or so furnished) in a timely manner all
Tax Returns relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable
period that ends before or includes the Closing Date. With respect to any such
Tax Return, as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the Purchaser, the
Shareholders shall provide the Purchaser with a copy of such completed Tax
Return and a statement (with which the Shareholders will make available
supporting schedules and information) certifying the amount of Tax shown on such
Tax Return that is allocable to the Purchaser at least 20 days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and
the Purchaser shall have the right to review such Return and statement prior to
the filing of such Tax Return. The Shareholders and the Purchaser agree to
consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising from the
Purchaser's review of such Tax Return and statement.

          (b)  The Shareholders shall pay or cause to be paid, when due and
payable, all Taxes which accrue with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for the Shareholder Tax Periods, and taking into account the last
sentence of Section 8.01(a). Payments by the Shareholders of any amounts due
hereunder in respect of Taxes shall be made (i) at least three Business Days
before the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax Return required to
be prepared by the Shareholders and filed by the Purchaser, and (ii) within 10
Business Days following either an agreement between the Shareholders and the
Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable, or a "determination" as defined
in section 1313(a) of the Code.

          SECTION 8.03.   Refunds/Tax Benefits.  (a)  Except as indicated in
                          --------------------
the last sentence of this Section 8.03(a), any refunds (including interest to
the extent actually received) received by the Purchaser, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of Taxes relating to and attributable to events arising in
any period or portion thereof which is included in the Shareholder Tax Periods
shall be for the account of the Shareholders, and the Purchaser shall pay over
to the Shareholders any such refund for the account of the Shareholders, within
five Business Days of receipt. The Purchaser shall, if the Shareholders so
request and at the Shareholders' expense, file (or cause to be filed) a claim
for any refunds or equivalent amounts to which the Shareholders are entitled
hereunder (including, without limitation, any refunds arising from payments
described in the second succeeding sentence). The Purchaser shall permit the
Shareholders to control (at the Shareholders' expense) the prosecution of any
such refund claimed. In addition, any refund or other Tax benefit arising from
the payment by North Central on or prior to the Closing Date of amounts
described in Section 6.14 shall be for the account of the Shareholders,
regardless of the Tax period to which such refund or other Tax benefit relates.
If any refund which the Purchaser has paid over to the Shareholders pursuant to
this Section 8.03 is subsequently adjusted, whether on audit or otherwise, a
payment in the amount of such adjustment will be made by the Shareholders to the
Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Shareholders, as appropriate, so as to put
the parties as nearly as possible in the same position as if the original
payment by the Purchaser to the Sellers had been in the amount of the refund as
finally determined.

                                       54
<PAGE>

          (b)  The Purchaser agrees to pay to the Shareholders the benefit
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from the use in any Tax period
or portion thereof which is included in the Purchaser Tax Periods of a
carryforward of a Tax Asset arising in a Tax period or portion thereof which is
included in the Shareholder Tax Periods. Such benefit shall be considered to
equal the excess of (i) the amount of Taxes that would have been payable by the
Company or the Company Subsidiary in the absence of such carryforward over (ii)
the amount of Taxes actually payable by the Company or the Company Subsidiary.
Payment of such amount shall be made within five Business Days of filing the
applicable Tax Returns for the period to which the Tax Asset is carried forward.
If, subsequent to any such payment by the Purchaser to the Shareholders, there
shall be a "determination" (as defined in section 1313 of the Code) resulting
from an audit which results in a reduction of the Tax Asset so carried forward,
the Shareholders shall promptly repay to the Purchaser any amount that would not
have been payable to the Shareholders pursuant to the preceding sentence had the
amount of the benefit been calculated taking into account such determination,
together with any amount equal to any interest and penalties payable by the
Purchaser as a result of such determination. For this purpose, "Tax Asset" means
                                                                ---------
any net operating loss, net capital loss, investment tax credit, foreign tax
credit or charitable deduction or any other similar tax attribute (including
deductions or credits relating to alternative minimum taxes) which is
apportioned under applicable Treasury Regulations or allocable under applicable
state or local income or franchise Tax law to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

          (c)  If an audit adjustment, claim for refund or amended return
("Adjustment") after the date hereof shall both increase a Tax liability which
  ----------
is allocated to the Shareholders (or reduce losses or credits otherwise
available) for a Tax period or portion thereof which is included in the
Shareholder Tax Periods (a "Prior Period Tax Increase") and decrease a Tax
                            -------------------------
liability of the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Tax
period or portion thereof which is included in the Purchaser Tax Periods, then,
when and to the extent that the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
derives a benefit from such decrease (through a reduction of Taxes, refund of
Taxes paid or credit against Taxes due), the Prior Period Tax Increase shall not
be indemnifiable by the Shareholders pursuant to Section 8.01 to the extent of
such refund, reduction or credit. Similarly, if an Adjustment shall both
decrease a Tax liability which is allocated to the Shareholders for a Tax period
or portion thereof which is included in the Shareholder Tax Periods and increase
the Tax liability of the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or
reduce losses or credits otherwise available) for a Tax period or portion
thereof which is included in the Purchaser Tax Periods (a "Prior Period Tax
                                                           ----------------
Decrease"), then, to the extent of such increase, the Purchaser shall not be
--------
required to pay over the Prior Period Tax Decrease to the Shareholders.

          (d)  Any estimated Taxes paid during a Tax period or portion thereof
which is included in the Shareholder Tax Periods that result in the total Taxes
paid by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including estimated Taxes paid
with respect to Tax periods or portions thereof which are included in the
Shareholder Tax Periods) to exceed the Taxes due and payable with respect to
such Tax periods or portions thereof shall be for the account of the
Shareholders. The Shareholders shall provide the Purchaser with a statement
(with which the Shareholders will make available supporting schedules and
information) certifying the amount of any such excess, and the Purchaser shall
pay over to the Shareholders any such excess within five Business Days of the
Shareholders providing such statement to the Purchaser.

                                       55
<PAGE>

          (e)  Any Tax benefits attributable to the Retention Bonus Plan paid to
North Central employees shall be for the account of the Purchaser.

          SECTION 8.04.   Contests.  (a)  After the Closing, the Purchaser shall
                          --------
promptly notify the Shareholders in writing of the commencement of any Tax audit
or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the
Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary which, if determined adversely
to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, is likely to give rise to grounds
for indemnification by the Shareholders. Such notice shall contain factual
information (to the extent known to the Purchaser) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Tax Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability. If the Purchaser fails to give the Shareholders prompt notice of an
asserted Tax liability, then (i) if the Shareholders are precluded by the
failure to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted Tax liability in both
the administrative and judicial forums, the Shareholders shall not have any
obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax liability,
and (ii) if the Shareholders are not so precluded from contesting, but such
failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to the Shareholders, any
amount which the Shareholders are otherwise required to pay the Purchaser with
respect to such liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

          (b)  Except as indicated in the last sentence of this Section 8.04(b),
the Shareholders may elect to direct, through counsel of their own choosing and
at their own expense, any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may
be sought from the Shareholders (any such audit, claim for refund or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability are referred to herein collectively as a
"Contest"). If the Shareholders elect to direct the Contest of an asserted Tax
 -------
liability, they shall, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice of
asserted Tax liability, notify the Purchaser of their intent to do so, and the
Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to cooperate, at the Shareholders' expense, in each phase of such
Contest. If the Shareholders elect not to direct the Contest, fail to notify the
Purchaser of their election as herein provided or contest their indemnification
obligation, the Purchaser may pay, compromise or contest, at its own expense,
such asserted liability. However, in such case, the Purchaser may not settle or
compromise any asserted liability over the objection of the Shareholders;
provided, however, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be
--------  -------
unreasonably withheld. In any event, both the Purchaser and the Shareholders may
participate, at their own expense, in the Contest. If a Contest includes both an
asserted liability with respect to which an indemnity may be sought from the
Shareholders and an asserted liability for which no such indemnity may be
sought, the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.04(b) shall apply only to
such portion of the Contest as involves the asserted liability with respect to
which an indemnity may be sought from the Shareholders.

          SECTION 8.05.   Cooperation and Exchange of Information.  The
                          ---------------------------------------
Shareholders and the Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any
Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules and related records (whether in
computerized or written form),

                                       56
<PAGE>

work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
authorities. Each party shall make its employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Each party will retain all returns, schedules and work
papers and all material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for its taxable period first ending
after the last date which is included in the Shareholder Tax Periods and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such returns and other documents
relate, including extensions, or (ii) six years following the due date (without
extension) for such returns. Any information obtained hereunder shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing
of returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

          SECTION 8.06.   Conveyance Taxes.  Liability for all sales, transfer,
                          ----------------
stamp, real property transfer or gains and similar Taxes incurred as a result of
the sale of Shares contemplated hereby shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and
50% by the Shareholders.

          SECTION 8.07.   Miscellaneous.  (a)  The Shareholders and the
                          -------------
Purchaser agree to treat all payments made under the indemnity provisions of
this Agreement or Section 3.12, and for any misrepresentations or breach of
warranties or covenants, as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes. If, in the reasonable opinion of either counsel to the Purchaser or
counsel to the Shareholders, the making by the Purchaser of any such payment or
a specified portion thereof or any payment or a specified portion thereof, by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Article VIII in cash would jeopardize the
qualification of the Merger as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Code, then the Purchaser (if Purchaser's counsel so
concludes) or the Shareholders (if the Shareholders' counsel so concludes) may
elect that such payment or portion thereof be made in Purchaser Common Stock
having a value equal to the amount of such payment or portion thereof. For this
purpose, the value of the Purchaser Common Stock shall be determined in the same
manner as the Average Parent Share Price, except that the last trading day used
for this purpose shall be the trading day which is five days prior to the date
of the payment. For this purpose, the Average Parent Share Price shall be not
less than $22.25 nor greater than $27.25.

          (b)  Payments by the Shareholders hereunder shall be limited to the
amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom (i) any
tax benefit realizable by the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
by reason of the deductibility of such liability or damage (determined by
multiplying such deductible amount by the then applicable highest effective
corporate income tax rate), and any deferred tax benefit attributable to such
liability or damage (determined on the same basis but present valued to the
extent obtained through depreciation or amortization deductions), and (ii) any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recoverable by the Purchaser
from any third party with respect thereto.

          (c)  The Shareholders shall cause any tax-sharing agreements or
arrangements with the Company Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the date of
this Agreement.

          (d)  Any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.19 shall be a ground for indemnification by the Shareholders of the
Purchaser, subject to Section 10.04(d) and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement.

                                       57
<PAGE>

          (e)  Any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.11 shall be a ground for indemnification by the Purchaser of the
Shareholders.

          (f)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations of the Shareholders and the Purchaser to indemnify and hold
harmless each other pursuant to this Article VIII or the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.19 or Section 5.11 shall terminate at the
close of business on the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof).

          (g)  It is intended that all Tax benefits and refunds attributable to
the payments by North Central on or prior to the Closing Date which are
described in Section 6.14 of this Agreement shall be for the account of the
Shareholders, and this Article VIII and all other provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed accordingly.

          (h)  Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Shareholders will
provide the Purchaser a certification of non-foreign status, in the manner
prescribed by Treas. Reg. (S) 1445-2(b)(2).

     from Shearman & Sterling a written opinion, reasonably satisfactory to the
     Shareholders and dated as of the Closing Date, addressed to the Company and

     Shareholders, a registration rights agreement substantially in the form of

                                INDEMNIFICATION

          SECTION 10.01.   Indemnification of the Purchaser.  Each Shareholder
                           --------------------------------
agrees jointly and not severally, subject to the other terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the limitations contained in Section 10.04) and
without gross-up for Taxes, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
and each of the Purchaser's subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents and their successors and assigns (the Purchaser and all such
other Persons are collectively referred to as the "Purchaser's Indemnified
                                                   -----------------------
Persons"), from and against each and every Loss paid, imposed on or incurred by
-------
the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons relating to, resulting from or arising out
of: (a) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Company in this Agreement or (b) any Liability of the Company or any Non-
Energy Company Subsidiary, incurred or arising out of events which occurred
prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Liability directly relating to,
arising out of or resulting from the operations of North Central, for which
North Central has liability). The Purchaser's Indemnified Persons shall also be
entitled to recourse against the Escrow Consideration for any indemnifiable loss
on the same pro rata basis as would have been applied if the Persons on whose
behalf the shares and cash have been placed into escrow had executed Joinder
Agreements pursuant to Section 6.13. A Purchaser's Indemnified Person shall give
the Shareholders written notice of any matter which such Purchaser's Indemnified
Person has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder within sixty (60) days of such determination, supported by reasonable
documentation setting forth the nature of the circumstances entitling the
Purchaser's Indemnified Person to indemnity hereunder (including, but not
limited to, references to the provisions hereof upon which the Purchaser's
Indemnified Person is relying in making such claim).

          SECTION 10.02.   Indemnification of the Shareholders.  The Purchaser
                           -----------------------------------
agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and without
gross-up for Taxes, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Shareholders and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and legal and
personal representatives (the Shareholders and such other Persons are
collectively referred to as the "Company's Indemnified Persons") from and
                                 -----------------------------
against, and shall reimburse the Company's Indemnified Persons for, each and
every Loss paid, imposed on or incurred by the Company's Indemnified Persons,
directly or indirectly, relating to, resulting from or arising out of any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser in
this Agreement. A Company's Indemnified Person shall give the Purchaser prompt
written notice of any matter which such Shareholders' Representative has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder
within sixty (60) days of such determination, supported by reasonable
documentation setting forth the nature of the circumstances entitling the
Company's Indemnified Person to indemnity hereunder (including, but not limited
to, references to the provisions hereof upon which the Company's Indemnified
Person is relying in making such claim).

          SECTION 10.03.   Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims.  If any
                           ----------------------------------------
claim or proceeding shall be brought or asserted under this Article X against an
indemnified party or any successor thereto (each, an "Indemnified Person") in
                                                      ------------------
respect of which indemnity may be sought

                                       61
<PAGE>

under this Article X from an indemnifying Person or any successor thereto (each,
an "Indemnifying Person"), the Indemnified Person shall give prompt written
    -------------------
notice of such claim or proceeding to the Indemnifying Person in accordance with
Section 10.01 or 10.02, as applicable, who shall assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person and the payment of all expenses; provided that any delay or failure so to
                                        --------
notify the Indemnifying Person shall relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is materially
prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure.  The Indemnified Person shall
have the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing claims or
proceedings and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Person unless the
Indemnified Person shall in good faith determine that there exist actual or
potential conflicts of interest which make representation by the same counsel
inappropriate.  The Indemnified Person's right to participate in the defense or
response to any claim or proceeding should not be deemed to limit or otherwise
modify its obligations under this Article X.  In the event that the Indemnifying
Person, within fifteen (15) days after notice of such claim or proceeding, fails
to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim or proceeding,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such
claim or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or final determination
thereof.  Anything in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the Indemnified Person's prior written
consent, settle or compromise any claim or proceeding or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any claim or proceeding.  In the event the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any
claim hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Person in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Person all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Person's possession or reasonably available to the Indemnified Person or under
the Indemnified Person's control relating thereto as is reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Person.

          SECTION 10.04.   Limitations.  (a)  An Indemnified Person shall not be
                           -----------
entitled to indemnification under Article VIII and this Article X unless notice
of a claim for indemnity shall have been given within the applicable survival
period under Sections 8.07(d) and 13.01.

          (b)  The Shareholders' aggregate obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
and hold it harmless under Article VIII and Section 10.01 shall in no event
exceed $63,000,000 (the "Maximum Amount"). At such time, if any, as an aggregate
                         --------------
amount equal to the Maximum Amount has been paid to the Purchaser by the
Shareholders under this Section 10.04, no Shareholder shall thereafter have any
further liability under Article VIII and Article X.

          (c)  Each Shareholder's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser and hold
it harmless under Section 10.01 (and Article VIII with respect to Tax matters)
shall in no event exceed a percentage of the Maximum Amount equal to the
percentage of the total aggregate Merger Consideration received by such
Shareholder ("Pro Rata Share"). Each Shareholder's obligation to pay any
              --------------
indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 10.01 (and Article VIII with respect to
Tax matters) shall be limited to such Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of such Loss.
At such time, if any, as any Shareholder shall have paid to the Purchaser an
amount equal to such

                                       62
<PAGE>

Shareholder's Pro Rata Share of the Maximum Amount under Section 10.01 (and
Article VIII with respect to Tax matters), such Shareholder shall have no
further liability under such Section 10.01 (and Article VIII with respect to Tax
matters).

          (d)  No claim may be made against any Shareholder for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.01 or Article VIII with respect to any individual item of
Loss, unless the aggregate dollar amount of all claims against the Shareholders
for indemnification shall exceed $7,000,000, in which case the Shareholders
shall be liable for claims for indemnification only in excess of such aggregate
amount. Any adjustment to any Tax benefit attributable to a payment pursuant to
Section 6.14 shall not be subject to this Section 10.04(d).

          (e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event
shall the aggregate liability of the Purchaser hereunder exceed $63,000,000 (the
"Loss Ceiling") and (ii) the Purchaser shall have no further obligations under
 ------------
this Article X at the time when the Purchaser has paid indemnification hereunder
in amounts equal in the aggregate to the Loss Ceiling.

          (f)  No claim may be made against the Purchaser for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.02 or Article VIII with respect to any individual item of
Loss, unless the aggregate dollar amount of all claims for indemnification shall
exceed $7,000,000, in which case the Purchaser shall be liable for claims for
indemnification only in excess of such aggregate amount. Any adjustment to any
Tax benefit attributable to a payment pursuant to Section 6.14 shall not be
subject to this Section 10.04(f).

          SECTION 10.05.   Tax Matters.  Anything in this Article X to the
                           -----------
contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect
to indemnification for any and all Tax matters (including those contained in
Section 4.19 and Section 5.12) shall be governed by Article VIII; provided that
                                                                  --------
the limitations, manner of payment and procedures shall be governed by this
Article X.

          SECTION 10.06.   Tax Benefits; Insurance Proceeds.  Any
                           --------------------------------
indemnification payment required to be made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
reduced by (a) any net Tax benefits derived or to be derived by the Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates with respect to the item giving rise to the
indemnification payment, and (b) any insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates with respect to the item giving rise
to the indemnification payment.

          SECTION 10.07.   Escrow Funds and Shares.  The shares of Purchaser
                           -----------------------
Common Stock and cash placed in escrow pursuant to Section 3.13 shall be applied
to satisfy the indemnification rights of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons
pursuant to Article VIII and Article X on the same pro rata basis as would have
been applied if the Persons on whose behalf the shares and cash have been placed
into escrow had executed Joinder Agreements pursuant to Section 6.13 and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

          SECTION 10.08.   Security; Limited Recourse.  (a)  The Shareholders
                           --------------------------
will arrange for the issuance, on the Closing Date, of an irrevocable letter of
credit in an amount equal to the Maximum Amount minus the amount of the Escrow
                                                -----
Consideration, issued by a

                                       63
<PAGE>

bank or other financial institution having a rating of at least "A+" from
Standards & Poor's selected by the Shareholders, in favor of the Purchaser (the
"Security"). The Security shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
 --------
to the Company and the Purchaser. In the event that the issuer of the Security
is downgraded below "A+", the Shareholders will replace the Security with a new
irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution having a rating
of at least "A+." For purposes of this Section 10.08(a), the amount of the
Escrow Consideration will be deemed to be the sum of (x) the amount of cash
placed into escrow, plus (y) the product of the number of shares of Purchaser
                    ----
Common Stock placed into escrow multiplied by the Average Parent Share Price.

          (b)  The Security will be drawable in an amount necessary to satisfy
the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders under Article VIII and
Article X (i) upon the written request of the Shareholder Representative or (ii)
upon the presentation to the issuer of the Security of the final non-appealable
decision of an arbitrator or the final non-appealable judgment of a court having
jurisdiction over the matters relating to the indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders, in which instance the Security shall be drawable in the amount of
such final non-appealable judgment.

          (c)  The Security and the Escrow Consideration, if any, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for any claims, demands, actions or causes of action
by any of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons under Article VIII and Article X
of this Agreement, and the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons shall make claims
under this Agreement only against the Security and the Escrow Consideration.

          SECTION 10.09.   Exclusive Remedies.  (a)  The Purchaser, the Company
                           ------------------
and the Shareholders acknowledge and agree that (i) following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of Article VIII and this Article X shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of each party for any breach by the other party of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the
other party to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements that, by
their terms, were to have been performed or complied with by such party prior to
the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action it may have, from and after the Closing, against the other
party hereto or its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and
Affiliates relating thereto.

          (b)  Except as set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto are not
making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the
matters contained herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of any party hereto,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for, and in no event shall the amount specified in Section 10.04(d) be
applied to, any indirect, consequential or punitive damages or claims for loss
of business or loss of profits.

                            TERMINATION AND WAIVER

          SECTION 11.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
                         -----------
time prior to the Closing:

          (a)  by the Purchaser upon a material breach of any representation,
     warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in
     this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall
     have become untrue in any material respects, in either case such that the
     conditions set forth in Section 9.03 would not be satisfied; provided,
                                                                  --------
     however, that, if such breach is curable by the Company, through the
     -------
     exercise of its reasonable best efforts and for so long as the Company
     continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts after written notice
     thereof from the Purchaser to the Company, the Purchaser may not terminate
     this Agreement under this Section 11.01(a);

          (b)  by the Company upon a material breach of any representation,
     warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth in
     this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Purchaser shall
     have become untrue in any material respect, in either case such that the
     conditions set forth in Section 9.02 would not be satisfied; provided,
                                                                  --------
     however, that, if such breach is curable by the Purchaser through the
     -------
     exercise of its reasonable best efforts and the Purchaser continues to
     exercise such reasonable best efforts after written notice thereof from the
     Company to the Purchaser, the Company may not terminate this Agreement
     under this Section 11.01(b);

          (c)  by the Purchaser or the Company if this Agreement shall fail to
     receive the requisite affirmative vote for approval at the Company
     Shareholders' Meeting;

          (d)  by the Company or the Purchaser if this Agreement and the
     issuance of shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the
     Merger shall fail to receive the requisite affirmative vote for approval at
     the Purchaser Stockholders' Meeting;

          (e)  by either the Company or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not
     have occurred by June 1, 2001; provided, however, that the right to
                                    --------  -------
     terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.01(e) shall not be available
     to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
     shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the
     Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

          (f)  by either the Purchaser or the Company in the event that any
     Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
     taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling
     or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or

          (g)  by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchaser.

          SECTION 11.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
                         ---------------------
this Agreement as provided in Section 11.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto
except (a) as set forth in Sections 6.03 and 13.02, (b) that nothing herein
shall relieve either party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement, (c) that upon the termination of this Agreement by the Company or the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.01(d), the Purchaser shall pay the Company a

other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
of the other party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound
thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition,
or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of
any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
any of such rights.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                          SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

          SECTION 12.01. Designation. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                         -----------
this Article XII, Goelet, LLC is designated as the representative of the

                   --------------------------
and the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Shareholder Representative shall
serve, as the sole representative of the Shareholders from and after the
Effective Time with respect to the matters set forth in this Agreement, such
service to be without compensation except for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses and indemnification specifically provided herein. The Shareholder
Representative has accepted such designation as of the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Shareholder Representative shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on behalf of any
Shareholder shall otherwise exist against the Shareholder Representative.

          SECTION 12.02. Authority. Each of the Shareholders, by executing this
                         ---------
Agreement, will and hereby does, effective as of the Effective Time, irrevocably
appoint the Shareholder Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact
for such Shareholder for all purposes of this Agreement, including full power
and authority on such Shareholder's behalf (a) to execute and deliver to the
Purchaser the Registration Rights Agreement and the Standstill and Voting
Agreement, (b) to take all actions which the Shareholder Representative
considers reasonably necessary or desirable in connection with the defense,
pursuit or settlement of any determinations relating to any claims for
indemnification pursuant to Article X, including to sue, defend, negotiate,
settle and compromise any such claims for indemnification made by or against,
and other disputes with, the Purchaser or the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
pursuant

<PAGE>

to this Agreement or any of the agreements or transactions contemplated hereby;

exercise all other rights which the Shareholder Representative (in his sole
discretion) considers necessary or appropriate in connection with this

such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, and are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Shareholder Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Shareholder. All decisions and acts by the Shareholder Representative shall be
binding upon all of the Shareholders, and no Shareholder shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

          SECTION 12.03. Reliance by Third Parties on the Shareholder
                         --------------------------------------------
Representative's Authority. The Shareholder Representative is authorized to act

on the Shareholders' behalf and, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement
among the Shareholders and the other parties hereto, shall be entitled to rely
on any and all action taken by the Shareholder Representative without any
liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the Shareholders even if such
party shall be aware of any actual or potential dispute or disagreement among
the Shareholders. Each of the other parties hereto is expressly authorized to
rely on the genuineness of the signature of the Shareholder Representative and,
upon receipt of any writing which reasonably appears to have been signed by the
Shareholder Representative, the other parties hereto may act upon the same
without any further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

          SECTION 12.04. Exculpation and Indemnification. Neither the
                         -------------------------------
Shareholder Representative nor any agent employed by him shall be liable to any
Shareholder relating to the performance of his duties under this Agreement for
any errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise,
except to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken or not
taken by the Shareholder Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not
taken in bad faith. The Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Shareholders against all Losses paid or incurred in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or claim to which the Shareholder
Representative is made a party by reason of the fact that he was acting as the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------
the Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder to the extent it is finally determined in a court of competent
jurisdiction that the actions taken or not taken by the Shareholder
Representative constituted fraud or were taken or not taken in bad faith. The
Shareholder Representative shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
statement or certificate believed by him to be genuine and to have been
furnished by the appropriate person and in acting or refusing to act in good
faith on any matter.

American Arbitration Association shall not, without the consent of the parties
hereto, be affiliated with the Purchaser, the Company, the Shareholders or any
