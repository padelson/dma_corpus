ARTICLE II

THE MERGER 

2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
the Company shall cease. Purchaser shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter 

 



6

    

 sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in
the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the TBCA and its name and
separate corporate existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

2.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place by the
electronic (PDF), facsimile or overnight courier exchange of executed
documents or at a location and time as agreed to by the parties hereto on the
date designated by Purchaser within fifteen (15) calendar days following
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth
in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), or such later date as the parties may otherwise
agree (the "Closing Date").

2.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Purchaser and the Company
shall duly execute and deliver articles of merger to the Tennessee Secretary,
to the extent required by the relevant provision of the TBCA (the "Articles of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective when the Articles of Merger are
duly filed or at such later date or time as Purchaser and the Company agree
and specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time"). 

2.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the TBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall possess
all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of
the Company.

2.5 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Excluded Shares, shall become and be converted into the right to
receive, without interest, 2.864 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Purchaser
Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a
share of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be
issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Closing Price.

 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number of shares or into a different kind of shares or securities by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution
(for the avoidance of doubt, any quarterly cash dividend declared by the
Company or Purchaser shall not be considered an extraordinary dividend of
distribution) paid, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately and
proportionately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement before such event;
_provided_ , that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit
Purchaser or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, except for Dissenting Shares, each Excluded
Share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange
or payment shall be made with respect thereto. All shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that are held by the Company, if any, other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, shall
be canceled and shall constitute authorized but unissued shares.

2.6 Dissenters Rights. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, the
holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the TBCA (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") and has not effectively withdrawn

 



7

    

 or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration hereunder and shall be entitled only to such rights as are
available to such holder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the TBCA.
Each holder of a Dissenting Share shall be entitled to receive the value of
such Dissenting Share held by him in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the TBCA; _provided_ , that such holder complies with the
procedures contemplated by and set forth in the applicable provisions of the
TBCA. If any holder of any Dissenting Share shall effectively withdraw or lose
such holders dissenters rights under the applicable provisions of the TBCA,
each such Dissenting Share shall be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_. The Company shall
promptly notify Purchaser of each stockholder who asserts rights as a
Dissenting Stockholder following receipt of such stockholders written demand
delivered as provided in the TBCA. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily
make any payment or commit or agree to make any payment, or settle or commit
or offer to settle, any rights of a Dissenting Stockholder asserted under the
TBCA.

 

2.7 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an
agreement entered into before the Closing, for the benefit of the holders of
record of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.7_,
(i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock sufficient to deliver the
aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_, and Purchaser shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration. Appropriate
transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") shall be mailed as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed only
if the completed Letter of Transmittal is accompanied by one or
more Certificates representing Company Common Stock (or customary affidavits
and, if required by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.7(h)_, indemnification
regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed
delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common
Stock to be converted thereby.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and as to Dissenting Shares,
shall represent only the right to receive applicable payments as set forth in
_Section 2.6_. The Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein.

(c) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate, or, at the election of
Purchaser, a statement reflecting shares issued in book entry form,
representing that number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ and a check in
the amount equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares such holder is
entitled to pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled to pursuant to _Section
2.7(d)_. Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as
practicable following receipt of the properly completed Letter of Transmittal
and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent shall
distribute Purchaser Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer
of ownership of any shares of Company Common

 



8

    

 Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Certificates
representing such Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser
and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of Purchaser Common
Stock hereunder until such Person surrenders his or her Certificates in
accordance with this _Section 2.7_. Upon the surrender of such Persons
Certificates, such Person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which after the Effective Time had
become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock
represented by such Persons Certificates.

(e) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of
Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to Purchaser, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7_. __

 

(f) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu of
fractions of a share pursuant to  _Section 2.5_, any dividends or other
distributions to be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ or any proceeds from
any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company
Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by
the Exchange Agent to Purchaser upon the written request of Purchaser. After
such request is made, each holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _Section 2.7_ shall look only to Purchaser
for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_
of this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any
Affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common
Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the Companys stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. The Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.5_. __

 

2.8 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, and except as provided in  _Section 2.5_ _(d)_ , each share of
Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

2.9 Directors of Surviving Corporation After Effective Time. Immediately after
the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified, the directors of the Surviving Corporation

 



9

    

 shall consist of the directors of Purchaser serving immediately before the
Effective Time, plus the Designated Directors as contemplated by _Section
5.15_. __

 

2.10 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation of
Purchaser, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms thereof. The bylaws of
Purchaser, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law and the terms of such bylaws.

 

 __2.11 Treatment of Stock Options. __

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 2.11(b)_, at the Effective Time, each
option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto ("Company Stock Option") that was
granted pursuant to the Athens Bancshares Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive
Plan (the "Company Equity Plan") shall be automatically assumed and converted
into an option (an "Adjusted Stock Option") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including vesting terms) the number shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price
per share of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto that was granted pursuant to the
Company Equity Plan that is held by any employee or service provider of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who has terminated employment or service prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically become vested and shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive from Purchaser a cash payment in an
amount, less required withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Option Payment Amount
exceeds the exercise price of such Company Stock Option. If the exercise price
of any Company Stock Option described in the immediately preceding sentence is
greater than the Option Payment Amount, then at the Effective Time, such
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange
therefor. Such cash payment shall be paid no later than five (5) Business Days
following the Closing Date.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall file
a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock subject to
the Adjusted Stock Options.

2.12 Bank Merger. As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Capstar Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser
("Purchaser Bank"), and Athens Federal Community Bank, National
Association ("AFCB"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, shall enter
into the Plan of Bank Merger, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ ,
pursuant to which AFCB shall merge with and into Purchaser Bank (the
"Bank Merger"). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause AFCB, and Purchaser shall cause Purchaser Bank,
to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such other documents
and certificates as are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger ("Bank Merger
Certificates").

 

2.13 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Purchaser may specify that the
structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be revised and
the parties shall enter into such alternative transactions as Purchaser may
reasonably determine to 

 



10

    

 effect the purposes of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such
revised structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) adversely limit or
impact the qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the IRC. If Purchaser elects to make such a
revision, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the
revised structure.

 

2.14 Absence of Control. It is the intent of the parties hereto that
Purchaser, by reason of this Agreement, shall not be deemed (until
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control, directly or
indirectly, the Company or its Subsidiaries or to exercise, directly or
indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

2.15 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Purchaser
or Purchaser Bank shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or AFCB, or (ii) otherwise carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, AFCB, the Company and their respective
officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to Purchaser
and Purchaser Bank an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver,
in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Purchaser or Purchaser Bank
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company or AFCB or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the respective officers and directors of Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank are authorized in the name of the Company or AFCB or otherwise
to take any and all such action.

 

2.16 Withholding. Purchaser or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent.

Purchaser Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most

CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; or (ii)

information security program adopted by Purchaser Bank. No non-public customer
information has been disclosed to or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, accessed
by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause either Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The Board of
Directors of Purchaser Bank (or where appropriate of any other Subsidiary of
Purchaser) has adopted, and Purchaser Bank (or such other Subsidiary of
Purchaser) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program that contains

the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization. There are no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there has occurred no
fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial
reporting. Since January 1, 2015, neither Purchaser nor any of

Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation or assertion

offs and accruals) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls.

all Environmental Laws. __

 

 __(bb) _Insurance_. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are presently insured for
amounts deemed reasonable by management of Purchaser against such risks as

any of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, the license,
sublicense or agreement covering such item is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and the Subsidiaries.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge,
complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation with or of any intellectual
property rights of a third party (including any claims that Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any intellectual
property rights of a third party). To the Knowledge of Purchaser, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property
rights of third parties and no third party has interfered with, infringed
upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual
property rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

unauthorized access to any of the Purchaser IT Systems that has had, or is
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Purchaser
and Purchaser Bank have taken reasonable measures to provide for the back-up
and recovery of the data and information necessary to the conduct of their

41

    

 Subsidiaries officers, directors or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Representatives")
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce or encourage, or
take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries, offers discussions or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any confidential or non-public
information or data regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford

response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest

intent, arrangement or understanding contemplating any Acquisition Proposal
or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, it is

sentence by any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.1_ by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, before the adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting,
this  _Section 5.1(a)_ shall not prohibit the Company from furnishing non-
public information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries to, or entering
into discussions with, any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal that
is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) the

the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, (2) the Company has not breached any of the covenants set forth in
this _Section 5.1,_ (3) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good

discussions with, such Person, the Company gives Purchaser written notice of
the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish non-

Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms no more favorable to such Person than the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of February 23, 2018, between Purchaser and the Company is
to Purchaser and the Company also provides Purchaser, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time such information is provided or made
available to such Person, any non-public information furnished to such other
Person that was not previously furnished to Purchaser. During the term of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any binding

agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into

Proposal.

 

(b) The Company will notify Purchaser orally within twenty-four (24) hours and

accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and (ii) terminate
access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person.

it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this

normal business hours throughout the period before the Effective Time to the
books, records, contracts, properties, personnel, information technology
services and to such other information relating to the other party and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested, except where such materials
relate to (i) pending or threatened litigation or investigations if, in the
opinion of counsel, the presence of such designees would or might jeopardize
any privilege relating to, the matters being discussed or (ii) confidential
supervisory information if, in the opinion of counsel, disclosure is
prohibited by applicable laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Neither party nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
entity in possession or control of such information or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into before the date of this Agreement. The parties will endeavor to
make appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements, consistent
with law, in the case of circumstances where the restrictions in clause (i),

advising it of the intention of the Companys Board of Directors to take such
action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise
to its determination to take such action and, if the decision relates to
an Acquisition Proposal, given Purchaser the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal and any written materials received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith; and _provided,
further_ , that if the decision relates to an Acquisition Proposal: (i) the
Company shall have given Purchaser three (3) Business Days after delivery of
such notice to Purchaser to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
(or make another proposal) and if Purchaser proposes to revise the terms of
this Agreement, throughout such period the Company shall have negotiated in
good faith with Purchaser with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposal; and (ii) the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors and after considering the results of such negotiations and
giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to
by Purchaser, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. If the Companys Board of Directors does not make the determination
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and thereafter
determines not to withdraw, modify or change its recommendation that the
stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement in connection with a
new Acquisition Proposal, the procedures referred to above shall apply anew
and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, modification or change. In
the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice

 



46

    

 to Purchaser and to again comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.8(c)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the three (3)
Business Day period referred to above shall be reduced to two (2) Business
Days. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to the vote
of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

 

5.9 Registration of Purchaser Common Stock.

 

(a) Within forty-five (45) days following the date hereof, Purchaser shall
prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC. The Registration
Statement shall contain proxy materials relating to the matters to be
submitted to Purchasers stockholders and to the Company stockholders at the
respective stockholders meetings and shall also constitute the prospectus
relating to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
(such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
the "Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). The Company will furnish
to Purchaser the information required to be included in the Registration
Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to
review and consult with Purchaser and approve the form of, and any
characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement
before its being filed with the SEC. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long
as needed to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of Purchaser and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to its respective
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of Purchaser Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or
the Registration Statement. If, at any time before the Effective Time, any
information relating to Purchaser or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Purchaser or the
Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by
Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, with the SEC and disseminated by
Purchaser and the Company to their respective stockholders.

(b) Purchaser shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each of
the Company and Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning it and the
holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action.

 

(c) Before the Effective Time, Purchaser shall notify or file an application
with the NASDAQ with respect to the additional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued by Purchaser in exchange for the shares of Company Common
Stock.

5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice to
the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other communication relating to,
a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this
Agreement and before the Effective Time, under any contract material to the
financial condition, properties, businesses or results of operations of each
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject; (ii) any event, condition, change or
occurrence which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained

 



47

    

 herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in
the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VI and (iii) any
event, condition, change or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate
has, or that, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its
occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party of
any notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the
consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

 

(a) Purchaser shall honor the Company Benefit Plans set forth in the Companys
Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans,
except to the extent an alternative treatment is set forth in this Section
5.11 or in Section 2.11 of this Agreement. For one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of all Persons
who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time and whose employment is not terminated before the Effective
Time (a "Continuing Employee"), for so long as such Continuing Employee
remains employed by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries, that, in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and
compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly-
situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

(b) At the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser may maintain the Companys
health and welfare plans through the end of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser determines
to terminate one or more of the Companys health and/or other welfare plans,
then, at the request of Purchaser, made at least thirty (30) days before the
Effective Time, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions, to
the extent required, providing that the Companys applicable health and
welfare plans will be terminated effective immediately before the Effective
Time (or such later date as requested by Purchaser in writing or as may be
required to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements
contained in such plans or provided for by law) and shall arrange for
termination of all corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and
related arrangements effective on the same date to the extent not prohibited
by the terms of the arrangements or applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents
shall terminate under any of the Companys health and welfare plans before
the time the Continuing Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become
eligible to participate in the health and welfare plans, programs and benefits
common to similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and
their dependents and, consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a
gap in coverage. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that Continuing Employees who become covered under health and welfare plans,
programs and benefits of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries shall (i)
receive credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid under the Companys
health and welfare plans for the plan year in which coverage commences under
Purchasers health and welfare plans and (ii) shall not be subject to any
pre-existing conditions under any such plans or arrangements, in each case, to
the same extent as applied under the Companys health and welfare plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Company employees who are not
Continuing Employees and their qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage under group health plans of Purchaser in accordance with
COBRA.

 

(c) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Benefit Plan in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the Purchaser Benefit
Plans the service of the Continuing Employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by the Company and its subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized: (i) to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits under any Purchaser Benefit Plans, (ii)
to the extent, at the sole discretion of Purchaser, the cash value of unused
paid time-off is paid to Continuing Employees at the Effective Time, (iii) if
similarly situated employees of IBG and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for service under the applicable Purchaser

 



48

    

 Benefit Plan or (iv) with respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plan that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. The value of each Company employees (including employees of
the Companys Subsidiaries) unused paid time-off is set forth in the Companys
Disclosure Letter. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability
of Purchaser to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or to review any employee benefit plan or program from time
to time and to make such changes (including terminating any such plan or
program) as Purchaser deems appropriate.

 

 __(d) If requested in writing by Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days
before Closing, the Company will also take all necessary steps to terminate
the Company 401(k) Plan immediately before the Effective Time, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and if further requested, shall prepare and
submit a request to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on
termination. If Purchaser requests that the Company apply for a favorable
determination letter, then before the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser)
to submit the application for favorable determination letter in advance of
the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable
determination letter as promptly as possible (including, but not limited to,
making such changes to the Company 401(k) Plan as may be required by the IRS
as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Before
the Effective Time, the Company, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser,
will adopt such amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and resolutions required
to effect the provisions of this _Section 5.11(d)_ (which, in the case of any
amendments or resolutions of the Company, shall be provided to Purchaser at
least five (5) Business Days prior to adoption for Purchasers review and
approval). If Purchaser requests the Company to submit an application to the
IRS for a determination letter, the Company 401(k) Plan participants who are
terminated at or after the Closing, but before the receipt of the IRS
determination letter, may elect to receive a distribution from the Company
401(k) Plan upon termination of their employment. Purchaser shall take any and
all actions as may be required to permit Continuing Employees to roll over
their account balances, excluding outstanding plan loans, in the Companys
401(k) Plan into Purchasers 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time. __

 

(e) The Company ESOP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms of the Company ESOP (as amended with
respect to the repayment of the loan as set forth below). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock in the Company ESOPs suspense account having a value equal to
the Company ESOPs indebtedness under the Company ESOP Loan collateralized
thereby shall be treated as Excluded Shares for purposes of this Agreement
and, at the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Such
cancellation of the shares of Company Common Stock in the Company ESOPs
suspense account shall be in consideration for the repayment and/or
forgiveness in full of the Company ESOPs indebtedness under the Company ESOP
Loan collateralized thereby. For purposes of the two immediately preceding
sentences, the value of a share of Company Common Stock shall be equal to the
value of the Merger Consideration, with the value of a share of Purchaser
Common Stock for such purpose determined based on the closing price during
regular trading hours of a share of Purchaser Common Stock on the NASDAQ on
the Closing Date. If requested, the Company shall prepare and submit a request
to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on termination. If Purchaser
requests that the Company apply for a favorable determination letter, then
before the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as are
necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to submit the
application for a favorable determination letter in advance of the Effective
Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such favorable determination letter as promptly
as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the
Company ESOP as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a
favorable determination letter). Before the Effective Time, the Company will
adopt such amendments to the Company ESOP and related trust and resolutions
required to effect the provisions of this _Section 5.11(e)_ (which amendments
or resolutions of the Company, shall be provided to Purchaser at least five
(5) Business Days prior to adoption for Purchasers review and approval).

 



49

    

__(f) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, Purchaser will honor
the Company Severance Plan; _provided, however_ , that the minimum severance
payment shall be four (4) weeks of base compensation irrespective of the
service of the employee. Continuing Employees (including such
Continuing Employees who are terminated at the Effective Time) who would
otherwise be eligible to receive benefits under the Company Severance Plan,
but who do not meet the minimum service requirements for eligibility will be
provided four (4) weeks of base compensation as severance pay if they are
terminated at or within one (1) year of the Effective Time other than for
cause. For one (1) year following the Effective Time, Purchaser or Purchaser
Bank will offer AFCB employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the
Bank Merger priority in applying for open positions within Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank; _provided_ , _however_ , that any decision to offer employment
to any such person shall be made in the sole discretion of Purchaser and
Purchaser Bank. __

(g) Purchaser shall honor all obligations under the employment
agreements, deferred compensation arrangements and group term carve out plans
set forth in the Companys Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms.

 

 __(h) The Company shall establish a retention bonus pool in the amount as
provided in the Company s Disclosure Letter for employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries jointly designated in writing by Purchaser and the Company to
help retain key employees; _provided_ , that no retention bonus pool payment
shall be made that would be considered an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC or result in any other adverse tax
consequence to the Purchaser. The amount and payment date of the retention
bonus for each applicable employee shall be jointly determined in writing by
Purchaser and the Company, but shall be no earlier than the date on which the
systems conversion is completed. __

 

(i) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser and Company
shall enter into employment agreements with each of Jeffrey Cunningham,
Michael Hutsell and Jay Leggett, Jr. to be effective as of the Effective Time.

(j) For one (1) year following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall provide
all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose employment was
terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following the
Effective Time, and who so desires, job counseling and outplacement
assistance services for three (3) months following his or her termination
date, and shall notify all such employees who want to be so notified of
opportunities for positions with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries for
which Purchaser reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall
consider any application for such positions submitted by such persons;
_provided, however_ , that any decision to offer employment to any such person
shall be made in the sole discretion of Purchaser. Such job counseling and
outplacement services shall be provided by a vendor selected by Purchaser.

 

 __(k) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.8_, the provisions of
this _Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or service provider
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this
Agreement. The terms of this Agreement shall not be deemed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, Purchaser Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by the Company, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to amend, modify
or terminate any compensation or benefit plan, program or agreement after the
Effective Time or (iii) confer on any current or former employee, director
or service provider any right to employment or continued employment or
service with the Company, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates. __

 

5.12 Indemnification.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and any
person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the
Effective Time,

threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or

Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director,
officer, employee, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership,
trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity or (ii) any

Agreement, to the fullest extent such Person would have been indemnified or

and bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted by
applicable law, and Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

__(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  _Section
5.12(a)_, upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof. Any failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations __of Purchaser under  _Section
5.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. __

 

 __(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy with respect to claims
against such Persons arising from facts or events occurring at or before the
Effective Time ( _provided_ that Purchaser may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less favorable in any material respect to the insured); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend in the
aggregate pursuant to this _Section 5.12(c)_ more than 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " __Premium Cap
__") and, if Purchaser is unable to maintain such policy as a result of this
proviso, Purchaser shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
at a premium equal to the Premium Cap; _provided further_ , that Purchaser
may (i) request that the Company obtain an extended reporting period
endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor "tail" policies the material
terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any
material respect to such Person than the Companys existing insurance policies
as of the date hereof if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. __

 

 __(d) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such successor

set forth in this _Section 5.12_. __

 

 __(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are intended to be for the

information in such Disclosure Letters that has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, such written notice shall not

be automatically extended to June 30, 2019 (and in the case of such
extension, any reference to the Outside Date in any other provision of this __
Agreement shall be a reference to the Outside Date, as extended); in each
case, unless the failure to so consummate by such time is due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; __

 

 __(e) by either Purchaser or the Company ( _provided_ that the party seeking
termination is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), in the event of a breach of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the other party shall have
become untrue, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in
the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.2(a)_ and _(b)_ or _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , as the case may
be and such breach or untrue representation or warranty has not been
or cannot be cured within the earlier of the Outside Date and thirty (30)
days following written notice to the party committing such breach or making
such untrue representation or warranty, or by its nature or timing cannot be
cured during such period; __

__(f) by Purchaser, if (i) the Company shall have breached its obligations
under  _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.8_ in any material respect or (ii) if
the Board of Directors of the Company does not publicly recommend in the Joint
Proxy Statement-Prospectus that stockholders approve and adopt this
Agreement or if the Board of Directors effects a Change of Recommendation;
and __

 



54

    

(g) by the Company, at any time during the five-day period commencing
with the Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (the "Purchaser Ratio") shall be less than 0.80; and

(ii) The Purchaser Ratio shall be less than the number obtained by
subtracting 0.20 from the Index Ratio;

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If the Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_, it shall
give written notice to Purchaser ( _provided_ that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Purchaser shall have the option to increase the Exchange Ratio in a
manner such, and to the extent required, so that the condition set forth in
either clause (i) or (ii) above shall be deemed not to exist. If Purchaser so
elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to the
Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_ and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

 

 __For purposes of this _Section 7.1(g)_ the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated: __

 

"Final Index Price" shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the twenty
(20) consecutive full trading days ending on and including the Determination
Date.

"Index Price" shall mean $4391.77, which is the closing price on the Starting
Date for the NASDAQ Bank Index.

"Index Ratio" shall mean the Final Index Price divided by the Index Price.

"Starting Date" shall mean the third trading day before the date of the
first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.

"Starting Price" shall mean $20.25, which is the closing price of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source) on the Starting
Date.

 

7.2 Termination Fee; Expenses.

 

 __(a) If Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_,
the Company shall make payment to Purchaser of a termination fee of
$5,000,000. __

__(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by either party pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b),_ or (B) by either party pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_
without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (C) by Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, (ii) before the Company Stockholder Meeting
(in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_) or the date of
termination (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d) _and
_Section 7.1(e)_), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced,
disclosed or communicated and (iii) within twelve (12) months of such
termination the Company shall consummate or enter into any agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as set forth in clause (ii) of this _Section 7.2(b)_), then the
Company shall make payment to Purchaser of a termination fee of $5,000,000. __

 

 __(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_, (ii) the reason for such failure to consummate the Merger
on or before the Outside Date is that either of the conditions set forth in __

 



55

    

_ _ _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied by
the Outside Date and (iii) the failure of either such condition to be
satisfied is not attributable to the failure of the Company to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements set forth herein, then Purchaser shall
pay to the Company a termination fee of $4,000,000. __

 

 __(d) The fees payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds at the time of termination. Any fee
payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
after notice of demand for payment. The Company and Purchaser acknowledge
that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of
the __transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Purchaser would enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the other party for such termination
fee or any portion thereof, such other party shall pay the costs and expenses
of Purchaser or the Company, as applicable (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Purchaser or
the Company, as applicable, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_, then Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any
successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to
be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid. The amount payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ , or by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_, in
each case, constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the
sole remedy of Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, in the event of
termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such sections. The fee
contemplated by _Section 7.2(c) _shall solely be payable subject to Section
7.2(c) of the Companys Disclosure Letter. __

7.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated by
either Purchaser or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and, subject to Section 7.2, have no effect, and
there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or their
respective officers and directors, except that (i) Sections 5.3(c), 7.2 and
Article VIII, shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of
its fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A

 

FORM OF COMPANY VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This Voting and Support Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 11,
2018, is entered into by and among CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a
Tennessee corporation ("Purchaser"), Athens Bancshares Corporation, a
Tennessee corporation (the "Company"), and [●], a stockholder of the Company
(the "Stockholder"). Each of Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder may
be referred to in this Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties."

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the
same may be amended or supplemented, the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of the
date hereof, by and between Purchaser and the Company, the Company will be
merged with and into Purchaser, with Purchaser as the surviving corporation
(the "Merger");

 

WHEREAS, the Stockholder beneficially owns the number of shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") as
set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto (the "Existing Shares"); and

WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to Purchaser and the Company to
entering into the Merger Agreement, Purchaser and the Company have required
that the Stockholder, in his or her capacity as a stockholder of the Company,
enter into this Agreement.

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agrees
as follows:



   1. | _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement
have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with
its terms (the "Support Period"), the Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally hereby agrees, that at any meeting (whether annual or special
and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Companys stockholders,
however called, or in connection with any written consent of the Companys
stockholders, the Stockholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise
cause all of the Existing Shares, and other shares of Company Common Stock
over which he or she has acquired beneficial ownership after the date
hereof (including any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by means of
purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon the exercise of any stock
options to acquire Company Common Stock or warrants or the conversion of any
convertible securities or otherwise) (collectively, the "New Shares" and,
together with the Existing Shares, the "Shares"), which he or she owns or
controls as of the applicable record date, to be counted as present thereat
for purposes of calculating a quorum and (ii) vote or cause to be voted
(including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) all such Shares (A) in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of the Companys stockholders to
a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement,
(C) against any action or proposal in favor of an Acquisition Proposal,
without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and (D) against any
action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be likely to
(1) result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty
or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement, or of the Stockholder contained in this Agreement, or (2) prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the Companys or Purchasers ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, 
---|--- 
 



A-1

         |  including the Merger; _provided_ , that the foregoing applies
solely to Stockholder in his or her capacity as a stockholder or as a trustee
or a limited general partner in any entity holding Shares, and, to the extent
the Stockholder serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions or omissions taken
by the Stockholder in Stockholders capacity as such a director or officer,
including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions
or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or shall be construed
to prohibit, limit or restrict Stockholder from exercising Stockholders
fiduciary duties as a director or officer to the Company or its stockholders.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply to any Shares held
by any trust, limited partnership or other entity holding Shares for which
the Stockholder serves in any partner, stockholder or trustee capacity. To the
extent the Stockholder does not control, by himself or herself, the
determinations of such stockholder entity, the Stockholder agrees to exercise
all voting or other determination rights he or she has in such stockholder
entity to carry out the intents and purposes of his or her support and voting
obligations in this paragraph and otherwise set forth in this Agreement. The
Stockholder covenants and agrees that, except for this Agreement, he or she
(x) has not entered into, and shall not enter during the Support Period, any
voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Shares and (y) has not
granted, and shall not grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or
power of attorney with respect to the Shares except any proxy to carry out the
intent of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   3. | _GRANT OF IRREVOCABLE PROXY_. IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE BY THE
STOCKHOLDER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STOCKHOLDERS OBLIGATIONS AS TO
VOTING PURSUANT TO _SECTION 2_ DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD, THE STOCKHOLDER
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD) GRANTS TO AND APPOINTS
PURCHASER AS THE STOCKHOLDERS PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF
SUBSTITUTION), FOR AND IN THE NAME, PLACE AND STEAD OF STOCKHOLDER, TO
REPRESENT, VOTE AND OTHERWISE ACT BY VOTING AT ANY MEETING OF THE COMPANYS
STOCKHOLDERS, HOWEVER CALLED, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY WRITTEN CONSENT OF
THE COMPANYS STOCKHOLDERS, WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES REGARDING THE MATTERS
REFERRED TO IN _ SECTION_ __ _ 2_ DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD, TO THE SAME
EXTENT AND WITH THE SAME EFFECT AS THE STOCKHOLDER MIGHT OR COULD DO
UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO
THIS _ SECTION 3_ IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE DURING
THE SUPPORT PERIOD. DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD, THE STOCKHOLDER WILL TAKE SUCH
FURTHER ACTION AND WILL EXECUTE SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO
EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY. THE STOCKHOLDER HEREBY REVOKES ANY AND
ALL PREVIOUS PROXIES OR POWERS OF ATTORNEY GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE
SHARES THAT MAY HAVE HERETOFORE BEEN APPOINTED OR GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO THE
MATTERS REFERRED TO IN _SECTION 2_ AND THIS _SECTION 3_. 
---|--- 



   4. | _Transfer Restrictions Prior to Merger_. The Stockholder hereby
agrees that he or she will not, during the Support Period, sell, transfer,
assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate
or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation
of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily, enter into any swap
or other arrangements that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of, enter into any contract, option or
other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, lien, hypothecation or other disposition of (by merger,
by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise
convey or dispose of, any of the Shares, or any interest therein, including
the right to vote any Shares, as applicable (a "Transfer"), except with the
prior consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that the Stockholder may Transfer Shares
for estate planning, tax planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the
transferee, prior to the date of a Transfer, agrees in a signed writing
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to be bound by and comply with the
provisions of this Agreement or upon the death of the Stockholder. 
---|--- 
 



A-2

       5. | _Non-Solicitation_. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated, the Stockholder shall not initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal. The Stockholder will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Purchaser with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. 
---|--- 
 



   6. | _No Exercise of Appraisal Rights_. The Stockholder hereby waives
and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or right to dissent in respect
of the Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger.  
---|--- 



   7. | _Confidential Information_. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Stockholder shall not disclose any confidential information of
Purchaser or the Company obtained by such person while serving as a director
of the Company except in accordance with a judicial or other governmental
order or the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "confidential
information" does not include (a) information that is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure
by the Stockholder; (b) information that was in the Stockholders possession
prior to serving as a director or information received by the
Stockholder from another person without any limitations on disclosure, but
only if the Stockholder had no reason to believe that the other person was
prohibited from using or disclosing such information by a contractual or
fiduciary obligation; or (c) information that was independently developed by
the Stockholder without using any confidential information of Purchaser or the
Company. 
---|--- 



   8. | _Representations of the Stockholder_. The Stockholder represents
and warrants to Purchaser as follows: (a) the Stockholder has full legal
right, capacity and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform the Stockholders obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes a valid and legally
binding agreement of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, and no other action is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by the Stockholder or the performance of his or
her obligations hereunder; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Stockholder does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions hereof will not,
conflict with or violate any Laws or agreement binding upon the Stockholder
or the Existing Shares, nor require any authorization, consent or approval of,
or filing with, any Governmental Entity; (d) as of the date hereof, the
Stockholder beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) the Existing Shares; (e) as of the date hereof, the Stockholder
beneficially owns the Existing Shares free and clear of any proxy, voting
restriction, adverse claim or other Lien (other than any restrictions created
by this Agreement, under applicable federal or state securities laws or
pursuant to any written policies of the Company with respect to the trading of
securities in connection with insider trading restrictions, applicable
securities laws and similar considerations). 
---|--- 



   9. | _Effectiveness_. This Agreement shall be effective upon signing
and is irrevocable. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in
accordance with its terms, this Agreement (other than  _Sections 10_ through
_15_ ) shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect. 
---|--- 



   10. | _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. The recitals are incorporated as
a part of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement
are assignable by Purchaser to a majority-owned affiliate or any successor-in-
interest of Purchaser, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder. 
---|--- 



   11. |

_Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each Party agrees that this Agreement is
intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms and that Purchaser would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its specific terms and
that monetary  

---|--- 
 



A-3

         |  damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event.
Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Stockholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which Purchaser may be entitled (including
monetary damages), Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions hereof. The Stockholder further agrees that neither Purchaser nor
any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Stockholder irrevocably
waives any right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 
---|---

date hereof, by and between Purchaser and the Company, the Company will be
merged with and into Purchaser, with Purchaser as the surviving corporation

WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to Purchaser and the Company to
entering into the Merger Agreement, Purchaser and the Company have required
that the Stockholder, in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Purchaser,
enter into this Agreement.

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agrees
as follows:



   1. | _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement
have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with
its terms (the "Support Period"), the Stockholder irrevocably and
unconditionally hereby agrees, that at any meeting (whether annual or special
and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Purchasers stockholders,
however called, or in connection with any written consent of the Purchasers
stockholders, the Stockholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise

Purchaser, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions or
omissions taken by the Stockholder in Stockholders capacity as such a
director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this

Purchaser or its stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
commitments apply to any Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or
other entity holding Shares for which the Stockholder serves in any partner,

purposes of his or her support and voting obligations in this paragraph
