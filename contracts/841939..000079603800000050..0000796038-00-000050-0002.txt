Corporation, a California corporation ("Thoratec"), Lightning Acquisition
Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Thoratec
("Merger Sub"), Thermo Cardiosystems Inc., a Massachusetts corporation
("TCA"), and Thermo Electron Corporation, a Delaware corporation and majority
stockholder of TCA ("TEC"), with respect to the following facts:   A. The
respective boards of directors of Thoratec, Merger Sub, TCA and TEC have
approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into
TCA (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and have determined that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of,
their respective stockholders.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other
things, the outstanding shares of TCA Common Stock, $0.10 par value ("TCA
Common Stock"), will be converted into the right to receive shares of
Thoratec Common Stock, no par value ("Thoratec Common Stock"), at the rate
set forth herein.   C. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the parties\' willingness
to enter into this Agreement, TEC and Thoratec are entering into a
Shareholder Agreement (the "Shareholder Agreement") and a Registration Rights
Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement").   D. For United States
federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").    ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES AGREE
AS FOLLOWS:           2          ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER    1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of Massachusetts Business Corporation Law (the
"Massachusetts Law"), (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into TCA, (ii)
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and (iii) TCA
shall be the surviving corporation. TCA, as the surviving corporation after
the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."  1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the
"Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII,
unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto. The Closing
shall take place at the offices of Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe LLP, 333
Bush Street, San Francisco, California, or at such other location as the
parties hereto shall mutually agree. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts that, as appropriate, reflect the provisions of this Agreement
and are otherwise in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Massachusetts Law (the time of such filing, or such later time as may
be agreed in writing by the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger,
being the "Effective Time").  1.3 Effects of the Merger. The effects of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of TCA and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of TCA and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  1.4
Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) Subject to Section 5.8, from and
after the Effective Time, the Articles of Organization of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Organization of the Surviving Corporation,        
3        provided that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
changed to a name that does not include the word "Thermo" or any confusingly
similar name.   (b) Subject to Section 5.8, from and after the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.  1.5
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective
Time, all of the directors and officers of TCA and Subsidiaries of TCA shall
resign. The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall serve as the initial directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.     ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF
SHARES    2.1 Conversion of Stock. Pursuant to the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock
or securities of TCA or Merger Sub:   (a) As of the Effective Time, each
share of TCA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of TCA Common Stock to be canceled pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) and other than TCA Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.3(f)) shall be automatically converted into .835 (the "Exchange Ratio") of
a fully paid and nonassessable share of Thoratec Common Stock.   (b) As of
the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of TCA
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive (i) a certificate (or direct registration) representing
the number of whole shares of Thoratec Common Stock into which such shares
have been converted (the "Thoratec Certificates"), and (ii) cash in lieu of
any aggregate fractional share of Thoratec Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.1(f), without interest.   (c) As of the Effective Time, each
share of TCA Common Stock held of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time by TCA, Merger Sub, Thoratec or any       4     Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 2.1(g)) of TCA or of Thoratec shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (d) As of the Effective Time,
each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.10 par value,
of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of a
number of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed to evidence
ownership of the same number of shares of Common Stock, $0.10 par value, of
the Surviving Corporation.   (e) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted, or
Thoratec shall make appropriate provision, to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Thoratec Common Stock
or TCA Common Stock), extraordinary dividend or distribution, reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Thoratec Common Stock
or (subject to Section 5.1) TCA Common Stock occurring or having a record
date or an effective date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.   (f) No fraction of a share of Thoratec Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger. Instead, each holder of shares of TCA
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Thoratec Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Thoratec
Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Thoratec an
amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product
of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Thoratec Closing Value. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Thoratec Closing Value" shall mean the closing
price per share of Thoratec Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market System ("Nasdaq") on the trading day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.   (g) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange
Multiple" of any quantity means the product obtained by multiplying such
quantity by the Exchange Ratio, and the "Exchange Quotient" of any quantity
means the quotient obtained from dividing such quantity by the Exchange
Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary", when used with
respect to any Person, means any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly
or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person      
5     (through ownership of securities, by contract or otherwise) or (B)
such Person or any Subsidiary of such Person is a general partner of any
general partnership or a manager of any limited liability company. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means any individual, group,
organization, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or entity of any kind.  2.2 TCA Options; TCA Purchase
Plan.   (a) As of the Effective Time, Thoratec shall, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law, assume all of the stock options of TCA, whether
or not vested or immediately exercisable, outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the TCA Stock Plans (as defined below) (the "TCA
Options"). For purposes of this Agreement, "TCA Stock Plans" means TCA\'s
1999 Amended and Restated Directors Stock Option Plan, 1999 Amended and
Restated Equity Incentive Plan and 1999 Amended and Restated Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan. Each TCA Option, whether or not exercisable at the
Effective Time, shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, be
assumed by Thoratec in such a manner that it shall vest and otherwise be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the TCA Stock Plan
pursuant to which it was granted and the applicable option agreement issued
thereunder; provided that (i) each such option thereafter shall be
exercisable for a number of shares of Thoratec Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of
shares of TCA Common Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the option price
per share of Thoratec Common Stock thereafter shall equal the
Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the option price
per share of TCA Common Stock subject to such option in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Thoratec Exchange Options"). Prior to the
Effective Time, TCA shall make all adjustments provided for in the TCA Stock
Plans with respect to the TCA Options to facilitate the implementation of
this Section 2.2(a).   (b) Effective November 1, 2000, TCA shall suspend
participation in its November 1, 1992 Amended and Restated Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "TCA Purchase Plan"). Accordingly, immediately before the
Effective Time there will be no outstanding purchase rights under the TCA
Purchase Plan. Further, the TCA Purchase Plan shall be terminated effective
at the Effective Time, with the result that no additional purchase rights
shall be granted after the Effective Time.   (c) TCA shall terminate its
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the "Directors\' Plan") so that as
of the Effective Time no additional rights shall be granted under the
Directors\' Plan. As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding right to
purchase TCA Common Stock granted under the Directors\'      
6     Plan shall be assumed by Thoratec in such a manner that each such
purchase right shall thereafter be exercisable for whole shares of Thoratec
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange
Multiple of the number of shares of TCA Common Stock for which such purchase
right would otherwise have been exercisable determined as of the relevant
grant date under the Directors\' Plan, with the exercise price for each share
of Thoratec Common Stock under those assumed purchase rights being equal to
the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of the price per
share of TCA Common Stock under those rights just before the Effective Time.
Thoratec shall include all such shares of Thoratec Common Stock issuable
under the Directors\' Plan in the Registration Statement (as described in
Section 3.24).  2.3 Exchange of Stock Certificates.   (a) At or prior to
the Effective Time, Thoratec shall enter into an agreement with a bank or
trust company selected by Thoratec and reasonably acceptable to TCA to act as
the exchange agent for the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").   (b) At or prior
to the Effective Time, Thoratec shall supply or cause to be supplied to or
for the account of the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders
of TCA Common Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.3:
(i) certificates (or direct registration) evidencing the shares of Thoratec
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 to be exchanged for outstanding
shares of TCA Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient
to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares provided for in Section
2.1(f).   (c) Within three business days after the transfer agent for the
TCA Common Stock delivers, to the Exchange Agent, the required information
about the record holders of TCA Common Stock as of the record time for
determining the stockholders of TCA who will receive the merger
consideration, Thoratec shall mail or shall cause to be mailed to each Holder
a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the TCA Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the TCA Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for surrender of the TCA Certificates. Upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a TCA Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed, the Holder shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor: (i) certificates evidencing that number of shares of
Thoratec Common Stock issuable to such Holder in accordance with this Article
II; (ii) any dividends or other distributions that such Holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and (iii) cash in respect of fractional
shares as provided in Section 2.1(f), and such TCA Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No certificate representing shares of      
7     Thoratec Common Stock will be issued to a Person who is not the
registered owner of a surrendered TCA Certificate unless (i) the TCA
Certificate so surrendered has been properly endorsed or otherwise is in
proper form for transfer, and (ii) such Person shall either (A) pay any
transfer or other tax required by reason of such issuance or (B) establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with this
Section 2.3, from and after the Effective Time, each TCA Certificate shall be
deemed to represent, for all purposes other than payment of dividends, the
right to receive a certificate representing the number of full shares of
Thoratec Common Stock as determined in accordance with this Article II and
cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f). For purposes
of this Agreement, "TCA Certificate" means a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of TCA Common Stock, and
"Holder" means a person who holds one or more TCA Certificates as of
the Effective Time.    (d) No dividend or other distribution declared with
respect to Thoratec Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to Holders of unsurrendered TCA Certificates until such Holders
surrender their TCA Certificates. Upon the surrender of such TCA
Certificates, there shall be paid to such Holders, promptly after such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions, excluding
interest, declared with a record date after the Effective Time and not paid
because of the failure to surrender TCA Certificates for exchange.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
the Exchange Agent, Thoratec, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any holder of shares of TCA Common Stock for shares of
Thoratec Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the shares of TCA Common Stock (i) held by a Holder who, acting in
accordance with Sections 85 et seq. of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts Law,
before the TCA Special Meeting (as defined in Section 5.4(a)) has delivered
to TCA a written notice of such Holder\'s intention to demand payment in cash
for such Holder\'s shares of TCA Common Stock if the Merger is completed and
(ii) that are not voted in favor of the Merger, shall not be converted into a
right to receive shares of Thoratec Common Stock but rather shall entitle
their Holder to receive the appraised value of such shares under those
sections of the Massachusetts Law. (Shares of TCA Common Stock meeting the
requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of the previous sentence are referred to
in this Agreement as "TCA Dissenting Shares".) If, however, after the
Effective Time such Holder validly       8     and effectively
withdraws that Holder\'s right to demand payment for that Holder\'s TCA
Dissenting Shares, those shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive that number
of shares of Thoratec Common Stock set forth in Section 2.1(a), without
interest and irrespective of the then-value of such shares. Subject in all
respects to Sections 2.1 and 2.3, Thoratec shall then cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver a certificate representing those shares to that Holder.  
(g) TCA shall give Thoratec: (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for payment of any TCA Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other documents and written communications that relate to such demands, and
(B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the Massachusetts Law. TCA shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Thoratec, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of TCA Common Stock or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.  2.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
that any TCA Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed TCA Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Thoratec Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d); provided
that Thoratec may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed TCA
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Thoratec or the Exchange
Agent with respect to the TCA Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.  2.5 Tax Consequences. For United States federal income tax
purposes, it is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each party shall be considered
the adoption of a plan of reorganization by such party for purposes of
Section 368 of the Code.       9      ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF TCA     TCA makes to Thoratec and
Merger Sub the representations and warranties contained in this Article III,
in each case subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure statement,
dated as of the date hereof, delivered by TCA to Thoratec prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "TCA Disclosure Statement"). The TCA
Disclosure Statement is arranged in schedules corresponding to the numbered
and lettered Sections of this Article III, and the disclosure in any Schedule
of the TCA Disclosure Statement shall qualify only the corresponding Section
of this Article III.  3.1 Organization, Etc.   (a) Each of TCA and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of TCA and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or
leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a TCA Material Adverse
Effect. For the purposes of this Agreement, "TCA Material Adverse Effect"
means any change, event, circumstance or effect that is, or (including with
the passage of time) is likely to be or become, materially adverse to
the general affairs, business, operations, prospects, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of TCA and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, provided that: (i) any adverse change, event, circumstance
or effect arising from or relating to general business or economic conditions
which does not affect TCA and its Subsidiaries in a materially
disproportionate manner compared to other entities in TCA\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' industries shall not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be
taken into account in determining, whether there has been, a "TCA Material
Adverse Effect" and (ii) any adverse change, circumstance, event or effect
arising from or relating to the announcement or pendency of the Merger shall
not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a "TCA Material Adverse
Effect".      10      (b) Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any provision of its Articles of Organization, bylaws or any
other charter document. Schedule 3.1(b) of the TCA Disclosure Statement sets
forth (i) the full name of each Subsidiary of TCA, its capitalization and the
ownership interest of TCA and each other Person (if any) therein, (ii) the
jurisdiction in which each such Subsidiary is organized, (iii) each
jurisdiction in which TCA and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business as a foreign Person, (iv) a brief summary of the business and
material operations of each Subsidiary of TCA, and (v) the names of the
current directors and officers of TCA and of each Subsidiary of TCA. TCA has
made available to Thoratec accurate and complete copies of the Articles of
Organization, bylaws and any other charter documents, as currently in effect,
of TCA and each of its Subsidiaries.  3.2 Authority. TCA has full corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
agreements required to be signed by it under this Agreement to complete the
Merger (together, the "TCA Agreements") and, assuming the approval of the
Merger by a majority of the outstanding shares of TCA Common Stock at the TCA
Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with
Massachusetts Law, consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. TEC has full corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, the Shareholder Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement and the other agreements required to be signed
by it under this Agreement to complete the Merger (collectively, the "TEC
Agreements") and consummate the transaction contemplated thereby. The
execution and delivery of the TCA Agreements and the TEC Agreements and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the boards of directors of
TCA (with respect to the Merger and the TCA Agreements) and TEC (with respect
to the Merger and the TEC Agreements), and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of TCA or TEC are necessary to authorize the TCA Agreements or the
TEC Agreements or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
approval of the Merger by a majority of the outstanding shares of TCA Common
Stock at the TCA Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
in accordance with the Massachusetts Law). The TCA Agreements have been duly
and validly executed and delivered by TCA and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Thoratec and Merger Sub, constitute valid and
binding agreements of TCA, enforceable against TCA in accordance with their
terms, except to the extent that their enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by general
equitable principles. The TEC Agreements have been duly and validly executed
and delivered by TEC and, assuming due authorization, execution
and       11     delivery by Thoratec and Merger Sub, constitute
the valid and binding agreements of TEC, enforceable against TEC in
accordance with their terms, except to the extent that their enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.  3.3 No Violations, Etc. No
filing with or notification to, and no permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any domestic or foreign court, administrative agency,
commission, or other governmental or regulatory body, authority or
instrumentality ("Government Entity") is necessary on the part of TCA or TEC
for the consummation by TCA of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the TCA Agreements or the TEC Agreements, or for the exercise
by Thoratec, TCA and their Subsidiaries of full rights to own and operate
their businesses as presently being conducted, except (i) for the filing of
the Articles of Merger as required by the Massachusetts Law, (ii)
the applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"), state securities or "blue sky" laws and state takeover laws,
and (iii) filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"). None of the execution and delivery of the TCA
Agreements and the TEC Agreements, the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or compliance by TCA
and TEC with all of the provisions hereof and thereof, or the exercise by
Thoratec, TCA and their Subsidiaries of full rights to own and operate their
businesses after the Merger as presently being conducted (subject to
obtaining the approval of the Merger by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of TCA Common Stock at the TCA Special Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with the Massachusetts Law)
will: (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
Articles of Organization, bylaws or any other charter document of TCA or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to TCA or any of its Subsidiaries, or
by which any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under, or result in any material change in, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, acceleration, redemption or
repurchase under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, contract, agreement
or other instrument or obligation to which TEC, TCA or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets may be bound. Schedule 3.3 of the TCA Disclosure
Statement lists all consents, waivers and approvals required to be obtained
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
TCA Agreements or the TEC       12     Agreements under any of
TEC\'s, TCA\'s or any of their Subsidiaries\' notes, bonds, mortgages,
indentures, deeds of trust, licenses or leases, contracts, agreements or
other instruments or obligations.  3.4 Board Recommendation. The board of
directors of TCA has, at a meeting duly held on October 2, 2000: (i) approved
and adopted the Merger and the TCA Agreements, (ii) determined that the
Merger and the TCA Agreements are fair to and in the best interests of the
stockholders of TCA and (iii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger
and the TCA Agreements to the stockholders of TCA. The board of directors of
TEC has, at a meeting duly held on September 27, 2000: (i) approved and
adopted the Merger and the TEC Agreements, (ii) determined that the Merger
and the TEC Agreements are fair to and in the best interests of the
stockholders of TEC, and (iii) resolved that TEC shall vote or cause to be
voted all of its shares of TCA Common Stock and any such shares held by any
Subsidiaries of TEC in favor of the Merger and the TEC Agreements at the TCA
Special Meeting, including any adjournments or postponements of
that meeting.  3.5 Fairness Opinion. TCA has received the opinion of J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. dated on or before the date of this Agreement to the
effect that the Exchange Ratio is fair to TCA\'s stockholders from a
financial point of view, and has provided a copy of that opinion to
Thoratec.  3.6 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of TCA
consists of 100,000,000 shares of TCA Common Stock. As of the date of this
Agreement, there were 38,562,477 shares of TCA Common Stock outstanding and
2,063,653 treasury shares. As of the date of this Agreement, there were 4
3/4% subordinated convertible debentures due 2004 (the "TCA Debentures")
outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $53,300,000. Neither the
Merger nor any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
accelerate the date that any principal or interest is due under any TCA
Debentures, will constitute a default under any TCA Debentures, will give
rise to any rights of redemption respecting any TCA Debentures or will confer
any other rights respecting any TCA Debentures, except that the rights
to convert TCA Debentures into shares of TCA Common Stock shall become rights
to convert TCA Debentures into shares of Thoratec Common Stock, as adjusted
to reflect the Exchange Ratio.   (b) Except for the TCA Debentures, there
are no warrants, options, convertible securities, calls, rights, stock
appreciation rights, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, or
agreements or commitments of any nature obligating TCA to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of TCA, or       13     obligating
TCA to grant, issue, extend, accelerate the vesting of, or enter into, any
such warrant, option, convertible security, call, right, stock appreciation
right, preemptive right, right of first refusal, agreement or commitment. To
the knowledge of TCA and TEC, except for the Shareholder Agreement, there are
no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect
to the capital stock of TCA.   (c) True and complete copies of each TCA
Stock Plan, the Directors\' Plan and the TCA Purchase Plan, and of the forms
of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under each thereof,
have been made available to Thoratec. Such agreements, instruments, and forms
have not been amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements
to amend, modify or supplement any such agreements, instruments or forms.  
(d) Schedule 3.6(d) of the TCA Disclosure Statement sets forth the following
information with respect to each TCA Option: the aggregate number of shares
issuable thereunder, the type of option, the grant date, the expiration date,
the exercise price and the vesting schedule. Each TCA Option was granted in
accordance with the terms of the TCA Stock Plan applicable thereto. The
terms of each of the TCA Stock Plans do not prohibit the assumption of the
TCA Options as provided in Section 2.2(a). Schedule 3.6(d) of the TCA
Disclosure Statement sets forth the following information with respect to the
Directors\' Plan: the name of each director of TCA eligible to receive cash
or TCA Common Stock under the Directors\' Plan, the amount of cash and TCA
Common Stock issuable as of the date of this Agreement to each such director
and an estimate of such amounts as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of
the Directors\' Plan, each director of TCA will cease to accrue any rights
under the Directors\' Plan upon resignation of such director at the Effective
Time.  3.7 SEC Filings. TCA has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") all required forms, reports, registration statements
and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC (collectively, all such
forms, reports, registration statements and documents filed after January 1,
1997 are referred to herein as the "TCA SEC Reports"). All of the TCA SEC
Reports complied as to form, when filed, in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act")
and the Exchange Act. Accurate and complete copies of the TCA SEC Reports
have been made available to Thoratec. As of their respective dates, the TCA
SEC Reports (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein) did not, at the time they were filed (or,
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the       14     date
hereof, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To the knowledge of
TCA, no director or officer of TCA has failed to comply with any filing
requirements under Section 13 or Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.  3.8
Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in
the TCA SEC Reports (the "TCA Financial Statements"), (x) was prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act) and (y) fairly presented the consolidated financial position of TCA and
its Subsidiaries in all material respects as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, consistent with the books and records of TCA, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount. The balance sheet of TCA contained in TCA\'s Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 (the "Reference Date") is hereinafter
referred to as the "TCA Balance Sheet."  3.9 Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities. Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than (i) liabilities
included in the TCA Balance Sheet and the related notes to the financial
statements, (ii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice which, individually or in
the aggregate, are not and would not be reasonably likely to have a
TCA Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) liabilities under this
Agreement.  3.10 Absence of Changes or Events. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since the Reference Date no TCA Material Adverse Effect has
occurred and, in addition, TCA and its Subsidiaries have not, directly or

expressly contemplated or provided for in this Agreement. 3.11 Capital Stock
of Subsidiaries. TCA is the record and beneficial owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each of its
Subsidiaries. All of such shares have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights with respect
thereto and are owned by TCA free and clear of any claim, lien or encumbrance
of any kind with respect thereto. There are no proxies or voting agreements
with respect to such shares, and there are not any existing options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions, or other rights or other agreements or
commitments obligating TCA or any Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any
shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary or any other securities convertible
into, exercisable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for any such
shares. TCA does not directly or indirectly own any equity interest in
any Person except the Subsidiaries.      17     3.12
Litigation.   (a) There is no private or governmental claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding of any nature ("Action") pending or, to the
knowledge of TCA or TEC, threatened in writing against TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers and directors (in their
capacities as such), or involving any of their assets, before any court,
Government Entity, or arbitration tribunal, except for those Actions which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a TCA Material Adverse
Effect. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of TCA, threatened
which in any manner challenges, seeks to, or is reasonably likely to prevent,
enjoin, alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by the TCA
Agreements or the TEC Agreements.   (b) There is no outstanding judgment,
order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, Government Entity, or
arbitration tribunal in a proceeding to which TCA, any Subsidiary of TCA, or
any of their assets is or was a party or by which TCA, any Subsidiary of TCA,
or any of their assets is bound. 3.13 Insurance. Schedule  3.13 of the TCA
Disclosure Statement lists all insurance policies (including, without
limitation, workers\' compensation insurance policies) covering any business,
properties, assets or operations of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not they are policies issued directly to TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA (for
example, because they have been issued to or procured by TEC), and all claims
in excess of $50,000 made against or under any such policies with respect to
TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA (but not other insured entities) since
January 1, 1997. Neither TCA nor TEC has received notice of the cancellation
or threat of cancellation of any of such policy.  3.14 Contracts and
Commitments.   (a) Schedule 3.14(a) of the TCA Disclosure Statement contains
a complete and accurate list of all agreements, understanding and
arrangements, whether written, oral or established through common practice,
between TCA or any TCA Subsidiary and any Person that directly or indirectly
beneficially owns, or is controlled by or under common control with any
Person that beneficially owns, more than five percent of the outstanding TCA
Common Stock (the "TCA Related Party Agreements"). True and correct copies of
all TCA Related Party Agreements have been provided to Thoratec. To the
knowledge of TCA, the terms of the TCA Related Party Agreements are no less
favorable to TCA and its Subsidiaries than could be obtained from a third
party in an arms-length transaction.      18      (b) Except as
filed (including by incorporation by reference to earlier-filed documents) as
an exhibit to the TCA SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2000 or as
identified on Schedule 3.14 to the TCA Disclosure Statement (collectively the
"TCA Contracts", it being understood that the failure to identify an
agreement, etc. on that schedule that is required to be identified on that
schedule shall nevertheless be considered a "TCA Contract"), neither TCA nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any oral or written
contract, obligation or commitment of any type in any of the
following categories:   (i) agreements with any employees or consultants of
TCA or any TCA  Subsidiary respecting their employment, consulting, salary,
wages, bonuses,  incentive compensation, severance or retention pay, or other
compensation,  except for those employees or consultants whose annual rate
of  compensation, including potential bonuses and incentive compensation,
is  less than $100,000;   (ii) agreements or plans under which benefits
will be increased or  accelerated by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by  the TCA Agreements or the TEC Agreements or
under which the value of the  benefits will be calculated on the basis of any
of the transactions  contemplated by such agreements;   (iii) agreements,
contracts or commitments currently in force relating  to the disposition or
acquisition of assets other than in the ordinary  course of business, or
relating to an ownership interest in any  corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business enterprise;    (iv) agreements, contracts or
commitments for the purchase of goods,  supplies or equipment: (A) which are
with sole or single source suppliers  or (B) for a cost, for any one such
agreement, contract and commitment, in  excess of $250,000 and which, in the
case of this clause (B), provide for  purchase prices substantially greater
than those presently prevailing for  such materials, supplies or
equipment;   (v) guarantees or other agreements, contracts or commitments
under  which TCA or any of its Subsidiaries is absolutely or contingently
liable  for (A) the performance of any other Person (other than TCA or any of
its  Subsidiaries), or (B) the whole or any part of the indebtedness or
payment  obligations of any other Person (other than TCA or its
Subsidiaries);   (vi) powers of attorney authorizing the incurrence of a
material  obligation on the part of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries;     
19      (vii) agreements, contracts or commitments which limit or
restrict (A)  where TCA or any of its Subsidiaries may conduct business, (B)
the type or  lines of business (current or future) in which they may engage,
or (C) any  acquisition of assets or stock (tangible or intangible) by TCA or
any of  its Subsidiaries;   (viii) agreements, contracts or commitments
containing any agreement  with respect to a change of control of TCA or any
of its Subsidiaries;   (ix) agreements, contracts or commitments for the
borrowing or lending  of money, or the availability of credit (except credit
extended by TCA or  any of its Subsidiaries to customers in the ordinary
course of business and  consistent with past practice);   (x) any hedging,
option, derivative or other similar transaction and  any foreign exchange
position or contract for the exchange of currency; or   (xi) any joint
marketing or joint development agreement, or any  license or distribution
agreement relating to any TCA product or planned  product.   (c) Neither
TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to TCA\'s knowledge any other party to
any TCA Contract, has materially breached, violated or defaulted under, or
received notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under (nor does
there exist any condition under which, with the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both, could reasonably be expected to cause a material breach,
violation or default under), any TCA Contract.   (d) Each TCA Contract is a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of TCA, and to TCA\'s knowledge of
the other party or parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, and in full
force and effect, except for any TCA Related Party Agreements that will be
terminated as of the Effective Time and except where the failure to be valid,
binding, enforceable and in full force and effect would not have a TCA
Material Adverse Effect and to the extent enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors\' rights or by general principles of equity.  
(e) An accurate and complete copy of each TCA Contract has been
made available to Thoratec.   (f) The obligations to pay transaction
bonuses or other compensation occasioned by the Merger to the persons listed
on Schedule 3.14(f) to the TCA Disclosure Statement are obligations of TEC
and not obligations of TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA.      
20     3.15 Labor Matters; Employment and Labor Contracts.   (a) None
of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any union contract or other
collective bargaining agreement, nor to the knowledge of TCA, TEC or any of
their Subsidiaries are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union
to organize any of its employees. Each of TCA and its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with all applicable (i) laws, regulations and agreements
respecting employment and employment practices, (ii) terms and conditions of
employment, and (iii) occupational health and safety requirements, except for
those failures to comply which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a TCA Material Adverse Effect.   (b) There is no labor strike,
slowdown or stoppage pending (or any labor strike or stoppage threatened)
against TCA or any of its Subsidiaries. No petition for certification has
been filed and is pending before the National Labor Relations Board with
respect to any employees of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither TCA nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), with respect to any
former employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder, except for
obligations that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a TCA
Material Adverse Effect. There are no controversies pending or, to the
knowledge of TEC, TCA or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, between TCA or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective employees,
which controversies would have, individually or in the aggregate, a TCA
Material Adverse Effect.  3.16 Compliance with Laws. Neither TCA nor any of
its Subsidiaries has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation relating to the
export or import of goods or technology) of any Government Entity, except
where any such violations or failures to comply would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a TCA Material Adverse Effect. TCA and its Subsidiaries
have all permits, licenses and franchises from Government Entities required
to conduct their businesses as now being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, except for those, the absence of which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a TCA Material Adverse Effect.  3.17 Intellectual
Property Rights.   (a) TCA and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use
all intellectual property used to conduct their respective businesses (such
intellectual property and the rights thereto are collectively referred to as
the "TCA IP Rights"). No       21     royalties or other payments
are payable to any Person with respect to commercialization of any products
presently sold by TCA or its Subsidiaries.   (b) The execution, delivery and
performance of the TCA Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not: (i) constitute a material breach of any
instrument or agreement governing any TCA IP Rights, (ii) cause the
modification of any terms of any licenses or agreements relating to any TCA
IP Rights including, but not limited to, the modification of the effective
rate of any royalties or other payments provided for in any such license or
agreement, (iii) cause the forfeiture or termination of any TCA IP Rights,
(iv) give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any TCA IP Rights
or (v) materially impair the right of TCA, Thoratec or any of
their Subsidiaries to use, sell or license any TCA IP Rights or portion
thereof.   (c) Neither the manufacture, marketing, license, sale or intended
use of any product or technology currently licensed or sold or under
development by TCA or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) violates in any material
respect any license or agreement between TCA or any of its Subsidiaries and
any third party or (ii) to the knowledge of TCA, infringes in any material
respect any patents or other intellectual property rights of any other party.
There is no pending or, to the knowledge of TCA, threatened claim or
litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right to use, sell, license
or dispose of any TCA IP Rights, or asserting that any TCA IP Rights or the
proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof, or the manufacture, use
or sale of any TCA products, conflicts or will conflict with the rights of
any other party.   (d) TCA has provided to Thoratec a worldwide list of all
patents, trade names, trademarks and service marks, and applications for any
of the foregoing owned or possessed by TCA or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(e) TCA has provided to Thoratec a true and complete copy of its
standard form of employee confidentiality agreement and taken commercially
reasonable steps to ensure that all key employees and scientific employees
(whether or not key) of TCA and its Subsidiaries have executed such an
agreement. All scientific consultants with access to proprietary information
of TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA have executed appropriate non-disclosure
agreements with respect to such proprietary information.   (f) Neither TCA
nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware that any of its key or scientific
employees or scientific consultants is obligated under any contract, covenant
or other agreement or commitment of any nature, or subject to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that would interfere
with the use of such employee\'s or consultant\'s best efforts to promote the
interests of TCA and its Subsidiaries or that would conflict with      
22     the business of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted or proposed to be conducted. Neither TCA nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement to indemnify any other person,
including but not limited to any employee or consultant of TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries, against any charge of infringement, misappropriation or misuse
of any intellectual property, other than indemnification provisions contained
in purchase orders or customer agreements arising in the ordinary course of
business. All current and former key or scientific employees and scientific
consultants of any of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries who in TCA\'s reasonable
business judgment were appropriate have signed valid and enforceable written
assignments to TCA or one or more of its Subsidiaries of any and all rights
or claims in any intellectual property that any such employee or consultant
has or may have by reason of any contribution, participation or other role in
the development, conception, creation, reduction to practice or authorship of
any invention, innovation, development or work of authorship or any other
intellectual property that is used in the business of TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries, and TCA and its Subsidiaries possess signed copies of all such
written assignments by such employees and consultants.   (g) There are no
existing licenses between International Technidyne Corporation ("ITC"), on
the one hand, and TEC or any Subsidiary of TEC, on the other hand, respecting
any intellectual property owned or used by ITC.  3.18 Taxes.   (a) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" refers to any and all federal,
state, local and foreign taxes, assessments and other governmental charges,
duties, impositions and liabilities relating to taxes, including taxes based
upon or measured by gross receipts, income, profits, sales, use
and occupation, and value added, ad valorem, transfer, franchise,
withholding, payroll, recapture, employment, excise and property taxes,
together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to
such amounts and any obligations under any agreements or arrangements with
any other person with respect to such amounts and including any liability for
taxes of a predecessor entity. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Return"
or "Tax Returns" refers to all federal, state and local and foreign returns,
estimates, information statements and reports relating to Taxes, in each case
filed or required to be filed with a Government Entity.   (b) TCA and each
of its Subsidiaries have filed all Tax Returns required to have been filed by
them, and have paid (or TCA has paid on behalf of its Subsidiaries), all
Taxes required to have been shown on such Tax Returns. The most recent
financial statements contained in the TCA SEC Reports reflect an adequate
accrual (which accruals were established in accordance with GAAP) for the
payment of all Taxes payable by TCA and its Subsidiaries, as of the date
of       23     such financial statements. Except as reasonably
would not have a TCA Material Adverse Effect, no deficiencies for any Taxes
have been proposed, asserted or assessed against TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed for any
extension of time to file any Tax Return which has not since been filed.
Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries has been included in a consolidated
or combined Tax Return that has included TEC for any period not now closed
under all applicable statutes of limitations.   (c) Neither TCA nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
including, but not limited to, the TCA Agreements, covering any employee or
former employee of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries that: (i) could give rise
to the payment of any amounts that would constitute excess parachute payments
within the meaning of Sections 280G of the Code with respect to the change in
ownership or control that may occur upon the consummation of the Merger, or
(ii) could give rise to the payment of any amount that would constitute a
parachute payment within the meaning of Sections 280G of the Code with
respect to any change in ownership or control of TCA occurring after the
Closing Date. During the taxable year ending on the Closing Date, TCA and its
Subsidiaries have not become obligated to make any payment the deduction of
which would be disallowed pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.   (d) None
of TCA and its Subsidiaries has filed any consent agreement under Section
341(f) of the Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to
any disposition of a Subsection (f) asset (as defined in Section 341(f)(4)
of the Code) owned by TCA or any of its Subsidiaries.   (e) None of TCA and
its Subsidiaries: (i) has received any notice that it is being audited by any
taxing authority, (ii) has granted any presently operative waiver of any
statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for the
assessment of, any Tax, (iii) has permitted any Tax lien to be placed on any
asset of TCA or any of its Subsidiaries, except with respect to Taxes not yet
due and payable or (iv) has availed itself of any Tax amnesty or similar
relief in any taxing jurisdiction.   (f) None of TCA and its Subsidiaries is
aware of any reason why the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (g) TCA has not been
a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897 of the Code at any time after June 30, 1995.     
24       (h) Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
for the Taxes of any Person other than itself, TCA or another present
Subsidiary of TCA. Neither TCA nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
tax sharing or tax indemnity agreement.  3.19 Employee Benefit Plans;
ERISA.   (a) There are no "employee pension benefit plans" as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") ("TCA Pension Plans"), "welfare benefit plans" as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA ("TCA Welfare Plans"), or stock bonus, stock option,
restricted stock, stock appreciation right, stock purchase, bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, severance, holiday, or vacation plans, or any other
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement covering employees (or
former employees) employed in the United States that either is maintained
or contributed to by TCA or any TCA ERISA Affiliate (as hereinafter defined)
or to which TCA or any TCA ERISA Affiliate is obligated to make payments or
otherwise may have any liability (collectively, the "TCA Employee Benefit
Plans") with respect to employees or former employees of TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any TCA ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"TCA ERISA Affiliate" means any person (as defined in Section 3(9) of ERISA)
that is or has been a member of any group of persons described in Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, including, without limitation, TCA or a
Subsidiary.   (b) TCA and each of its Subsidiaries, and each of the TCA
Pension Plans and TCA Welfare Plans, are in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable laws.   (c) All contributions to, and payments from, the TCA
Pension Plans which are required to have been made in accordance with the TCA
Pension Plans have been timely made.   (d) All TCA Pension Plans intended
to qualify under Section 401 of the Code have been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") to be so qualified, and no event has occurred and no
condition exists with respect to the form or operation of any TCA Pension
Plan which would cause the loss of such qualification or the imposition of
any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.   (e) There
are no (i) investigations pending by any Government Entity involving any TCA
Pension Plan or TCA Welfare Plan, or (ii) pending or, to the knowledge of
TCA, threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits),      
25     suits or proceedings against any TCA Pension Plan or TCA Welfare
Plan, against the assets of any of the trusts under any TCA Pension Plan or
TCA Welfare Plan or against any fiduciary of any TCA Pension Plan or TCA
Welfare Plan with respect to the operation of such plan or asserting any
rights or claims to benefits under any TCA Pension Plan or TCA Welfare Plan
or against the assets of any trust under any such plan, except for those
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any liability
which would have a TCA Material Adverse Effect. To the best of TCA\'s
knowledge, there are no facts which would give rise to any liability under
this Section 3.19(e), except for those which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, either impair TCA\'s ability to consummate the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby or have a TCA Material Adverse
Effect.   (f) None of TCA, any of its Subsidiaries or any employee of the
foregoing, nor any trustee, administrator, other fiduciary or any other
"party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any TCA Pension
Plan or TCA Welfare Plan, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as that
term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) other
than such transactions that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
either impair TCA\'s ability to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or have a TCA Material Adverse Effect.  
(g) None of TCA, any of its Subsidiaries, or any TCA ERISA
Affiliate maintains or contributes to, nor has it ever maintained or
contributed to, any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. (h) None of TCA, any Subsidiary of TCA
or any TCA ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability under Title IV
of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.   (i) None of TCA, any of its
Subsidiaries or any TCA ERISA Affiliate has any material liability (including
any contingent liability under Section 4204 of ERISA) with respect to any
multiemployer plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, covering
employees (or former employees) employed in the United States.   (j) With
respect to each of the TCA Employee Benefit Plans, true, correct and complete
copies of the following documents have been made available to Thoratec: (i)
the plan document and any related trust agreement, including amendments
thereto, (ii) any current summary plan descriptions and other material
communications to participants relating to the TCA Employee Benefit Plans,
(iii) the three most recent Forms 5500, if applicable, and (iv) the
most recent IRS determination letter, if applicable.       
26      (k) None of the TCA Welfare Plans provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant
following termination of employment, except as may be required under COBRA,
or except at the expense of the participant or the participant\'s
beneficiary. TCA and each of its Subsidiaries which maintain a "group health
plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied with
the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA,
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder
except where the failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, either impair TCA\'s ability to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby or have a TCA Material Adverse Effect.  
(l) No liability under any TCA Pension Plan or TCA Welfare Plan has
been funded nor has any such obligation been satisfied with the purchase of
a contract from an insurance company as to which TCA or any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance company is in
rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding.   (m) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the TCA Agreements will not result in an

Act.  4.8 Compliance with Laws. Neither Thoratec nor any Thoratec Subsidiary
has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation (including, without limitation, relating to the export or
import of goods or technology) of any Government Entity, except where any
such violations or failures to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a       39     Thoratec Material Adverse Effect.
Thoratec and each Thoratec Subsidiary have all permits, licenses and
franchises from Government Entities required to conduct their businesses as
now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except for those the

recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount. The balance sheet of Thoratec contained in Thoratec\'s
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2000 is hereinafter referred to as
the "Thoratec Balance Sheet."  4.10 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than (i) liabilities included in the
Thoratec Balance Sheet and the related notes to the financial statements,

kind with respect thereto. There are no proxies or voting agreements with
respect to such shares, and there are not any existing options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, or other rights or other agreements or commitments
obligating Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary to issue, transfer or sell any
shares of capital stock of any Thoratec Subsidiary or any other securities
convertible into, exercisable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for

42      4.13 Litigation.   (a) There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Thoratec, threatened in writing against Thoratec or any Thoratec
Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers and directors (in their
capacities as such), or involving any of their assets, before any court,
Governmental Entity or arbitration tribunal, except for those Actions which,

Effect. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Thoratec,
threatened which in any manner challenges, seeks to, or is reasonably likely
to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) There is no outstanding judgment, order, writ,
injunction or decree of any court, Governmental Entity or arbitration

Disclosure Statement lists all insurance policies (including, without
limitation, workers\' compensation insurance policies) covering any business,
properties or assets of Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary, and all claims
in excess of $50,000 made against any such policies since January 1, 1997.
All such policies are in effect, and true and complete copies of all such
policies have been made available to TCA and TEC. Thoratec has not received
any notice of the cancellation or threat of cancellation of any of such
policy.  4.15 Contracts and Commitments.   (a) Schedule 4.15(a) of the
Thoratec Disclosure Statement contains a complete and accurate list of all

is controlled by or under common control with any Person that beneficially
owns, more than five percent of the outstanding Thoratec Common Stock (the
"Thoratec Related Party Agreements"). True and correct copies of all Thoratec
Related Party Agreements have been provided to TCA and TEC. To the knowledge
of Thoratec, the terms of the Thoratec Related Party Agreements are no less
favorable to Thoratec and the Thoratec Subsidiaries than could be obtained
from a third party in an arms-length transaction.   (b) Except as filed
(including by incorporation by reference to earlier-filed documents) as an
exhibit to the Thoratec SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2000 or as
identified on Schedule 4.15(b) to the Thoratec Disclosure Statement
(collectively the "Thoratec Contracts", it being understood that
the       43     failure to identify an agreement, etc. on that
schedule that is required to be identified on that schedule shall
nevertheless be considered a "Thoratec Contract"), neither Thoratec nor any
Thoratec Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any oral or written contract,
obligation or commitment of any type in any of the following categories:  
(i) agreements with any employees or consultants of Thoratec or any  Thoratec
Subsidiary respecting their employment, consulting, salary, wages,  bonuses,

$100,000;   (ii) agreements or plans under which benefits will be increased

prevailing for  such materials, supplies or equipment;   (v) guarantees or

customers in the ordinary course of business  and consistent with past
practice);   (x) any hedging, option, derivative or other similar
transaction and  any foreign exchange position or contract for the exchange
of currency or   (xi) any joint marketing or joint development agreement, or
any  license or distribution agreement relating to any Thoratec product or 
planned product.   (c) Neither Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary, nor to
Thoratec\'s knowledge any other party to a Thoratec Contract, has materially
breached, violated or defaulted under, or received notice that it has
breached, violated or defaulted under (nor does there exist any condition
under which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, could
reasonably be expected to cause a material breach, violation or default
under), any Thoratec Contract.   (d) Each Thoratec Contract is a valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of Thoratec, and to Thoratec\'s knowledge
of the other party or parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, and is
in full force and effect, except where the failure to be valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect would not have a Thoratec Material
Adverse Effect and to the extent enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights or by general principles of equity.   (e) An accurate and
complete copy of each Thoratec Contract has been made available to TCA and
TEC.  4.16 Labor Matters; Employment and Labor Contracts.   (a) None of
Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary is a party to any union contract or other
collective bargaining agreement, nor to the knowledge of Thoratec or any
Thoratec Subsidiary are there any activities or proceedings of any labor
union to organize any of its employees. Each of Thoratec and the      
45     Thoratec Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable (i)
laws, regulations and agreements respecting employment and employment
practices, (ii) terms and conditions of employment, and (iii) occupational
health and safety requirements, except for those failures to comply which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Thoratec Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) There is no labor strike, slowdown or stoppage pending (or any
labor strike or stoppage threatened) against Thoratec or any Thoratec
Subsidiary. No petition for certification has been filed and is pending
before the National Labor Relations Board with respect to any employees of
Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary. Neither Thoratec nor any Thoratec
Subsidiary has any obligations under COBRA, with respect to any former
employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder, except for obligations that
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Thoratec Material Adverse
Effect. There are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of Thoratec
or any Thoratec Subsidiary, threatened, between Thoratec or any Thoratec
Subsidiary and any of their respective employees, which controversies would
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Thoratec Material Adverse
Effect.  4.17 Fairness Opinion. Thoratec has received the opinion of Lehman

that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Thoratec from a
financial point of view, and has provided a copy of that opinion to TCA and
TEC.  4.18 Intellectual Property Rights.   (a) Thoratec and the Thoratec
Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all intellectual property used to

rights thereto are collectively referred to as the "Thoratec IP Rights"). No
royalties or other payments are payable to any Person with respect to
commercialization of any products presently sold by Thoratec or the Thoratec
Subsidiaries.   (b) The execution, delivery and performance of the TCA
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not: (i) constitute a material breach of any instrument or agreement

not limited to, the modification of the effective rate of any royalties or
other payments provided for in any such license or agreement, (iii) cause the
forfeiture or termination of any Thoratec IP Rights, (iv) give rise to a
right of forfeiture or termination of any       46     Thoratec IP
Rights or (v) materially impair the right of Thoratec or any of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries to use, sell or license any Thoratec IP Rights or
portion thereof.   (c) Neither the manufacture, marketing, license, sale or
intended use of any product or technology currently licensed or sold or under
development by Thoratec or any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries: (i) violates in
any material respect any license or agreement between Thoratec or any of the
Thoratec Subsidiaries and any third party or (ii) to the knowledge of
Thoratec, infringes in any material respect any patents or other intellectual
property rights of any other party. There is no pending or, to the knowledge
of Thoratec, threatened claim or litigation contesting the validity,
ownership or right to use, sell, license or dispose of any Thoratec IP

its standard form of employee confidentiality agreement and taken
commercially reasonable steps to ensure that all key employees and scientific
employees (whether or not key) of Thoratec and the Thoratec Subsidiaries have
executed such an agreement. All scientific consultants with access to
proprietary information of Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary have executed
appropriate non-disclosure agreements with respect to such proprietary
information.   (f) Neither Thoratec nor any Thoratec Subsidiary is aware
that any of its key or scientific employees or scientific consultants is
obligated under any contract, covenant or other agreement or commitment of
any nature, or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative agency, that would interfere with the use of such employee\'s
or consultant\'s best efforts to promote the interests of Thoratec and the
Thoratec Subsidiaries or that would conflict with the business of Thoratec or
any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries as presently conducted or proposed to be
conducted. Neither Thoratec nor any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries has entered
into any agreement to indemnify any other person, including but not limited
to any employee or consultant of Thoratec or any of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries, against any charge of infringement, misappropriation or misuse
of any intellectual property, other than indemnification provisions contained
in purchase orders or customer agreements arising in the ordinary course of
business. All current and former key or scientific employees and key
consultants of any of Thoratec or any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries who in
Thoratec\'s reasonable business judgment were      
47     appropriate have signed valid and enforceable written assignments
to Thoratec or one or more of the Thoratec Subsidiaries of any and all rights
or claims in any intellectual property that any such employee or consultant

financial statements contained in the Thoratec SEC Reports reflect an
adequate accrual (which accruals were established in accordance with GAAP)
for the payment of all Taxes payable by Thoratec and the Thoratec
Subsidiaries, as of the date of such financial statements. Except as
reasonably would not have a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect, no deficiencies
for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Thoratec or
any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries. Neither Thoratec nor any of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries has filed for any extension of time to file any Tax Return which
has not since been filed, in each case filed or required to be filed with a
Government Entity.   (b) Neither Thoratec nor any of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
including, but not limited to, the TCA Agreements, covering any employee or
former employee of Thoratec or any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries that: (i)
could give rise to the payment of any amounts that would constitute excess
parachute payments within the meaning of Sections 280G of the Code with
respect to the change in ownership or control that may occur upon the
consummation of the Merger or (ii) could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning

become obligated to make any payment the deduction of which would be

"employee pension benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA
("Thoratec Pension Plans"), "welfare benefit plans" as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA ("Thoratec Welfare Plans"), or stock bonus, stock
option, restricted stock, stock appreciation right, stock purchase, bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, severance, holiday, or vacation plans, or
any other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement covering
employees (or former employees) employed in the United States that either is
maintained or contributed to by Thoratec, any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries or
any Thoratec ERISA Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) or to which Thoratec,
any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries or any Thoratec ERISA Affiliate is obligated
to make payments or otherwise may have any liability (collectively, the
"Thoratec Employee Benefit Plans") with respect to employees or former
employees of Thoratec, any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries, or any Thoratec
ERISA Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement, "Thoratec ERISA Affiliate"
means any person (as defined in Section 3(9) of ERISA) that is or has been a
member of any group of       49     persons described in Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, including, without limitation, Thoratec
or a Thoratec Subsidiary.   (b) Thoratec and each of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries, and each of the Thoratec Pension Plans and Thoratec Welfare
Plans, are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws.   (c) All
contributions to, and payments from, the Thoratec Pension Plans which are
required to have been made in accordance with the Thoratec Pension Plans have
been timely made.   (d) All Thoratec Pension Plans intended to qualify under
Section 401 of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified,
and no event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to the form or
operation of any Thoratec Pension Plan which would cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code.   (e) There are no (i) investigations pending by
any Government Entity involving any Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare
Plan, or (ii) pending or, to the knowledge of Thoratec, threatened claims
(other than routine claims for benefits), suits or proceedings against any
Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan, against the assets of any of
the trusts under any Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan or
against any fiduciary of any Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan
with respect to the operation of such plan or asserting any rights or claims
to benefits under any Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan or
against the assets of any trust under any such plan, except for those which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any liability which
would have a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect. To the best of Thoratec\'s
knowledge, there are no facts which would give rise to any liability under
this Section 4.20(e), except for those which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, either impair Thoratec\'s ability to consummate the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or have a Thoratec Material
Adverse Effect.   (f) None of Thoratec, any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries or
any employee of the foregoing, nor any trustee, administrator, other
fiduciary or any other "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with
respect to any Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan, has engaged in
a "prohibited transaction" (as that term is defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA) other than such transactions that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, either impair Thoratec\'s ability to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or
have a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect.        50      (g) None
of Thoratec, any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries, or any Thoratec ERISA
Affiliate maintains or contributes to, nor has it ever maintained
or contributed to, any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.   (h) None of Thoratec, any
Thoratec Subsidiary or any Thoratec ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.  
(i) None of Thoratec, any of the Thoratec Subsidiaries or any Thoratec ERISA
Affiliate has any material liability (including any contingent
liability under Section 4204 of ERISA) with respect to any multiemployer
plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, covering employees (or
former employees) employed in the United States.   (j) With respect to each
of the Thoratec Employee Benefit Plans, true, correct and complete copies of
the following documents have been made available to TCA: (i) the plan
document and any related trust agreement, including amendments thereto, (ii)
any current summary plan descriptions and other material communications to
participants relating to the Thoratec Employee Benefit Plans, (iii) the three
most recent Forms 5500, if applicable, and (iv) the most recent IRS
determination letter, if applicable.   (k) None of the Thoratec Welfare
Plans provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant following termination of employment, except as
may be required under COBRA, or except at the expense of the participant or
the participant\'s beneficiary. Thoratec and each of the Thoratec
Subsidiaries which maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied with the notice and continuation
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder except where the failure to
comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, either impair Thoratec\'s
ability to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby
or have a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect.   (l) No liability under any
Thoratec Pension Plan or Thoratec Welfare Plan has been funded nor has any
such obligation been satisfied with the purchase of a contract from an
insurance company as to which Thoratec or any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice that such insurance company is in rehabilitation or a
comparable proceeding.        51      (m) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Thoratec Agreements will not result in an
increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or accelerate the vesting
or timing of payment of any benefits or compensation payable to or in respect
of any employee of Thoratec or any of its Subsidiaries.   (n) Schedule
4.20(n) of the Thoratec Disclosure Statement lists each Thoratec Foreign Plan
(as hereinafter defined). Thoratec and each of the Thoratec Subsidiaries and
each of the Thoratec Foreign Plans are in compliance with applicable laws,
and all required contributions have been made to the Thoratec Foreign Plans,
except where the failure to comply or make contributions would not,
individually or in the aggregate, either impair Thoratec\'s ability
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or have
a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Thoratec Foreign Plans that
is a funded defined benefit pension plan has a fair market value of plan
assets that is greater than the plan\'s liabilities, as determined in
accordance with applicable laws. For purposes hereof, "Thoratec Foreign Plan"
means any plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement maintained or
contributed to by, or entered into with, Thoratec or any Thoratec Subsidiary
with respect to any employees (or former employees) employed outside the
United States to the extent the benefits provided thereunder are not mandated

wherewithal to consummate that Thoratec Acquisition Proposal, and the board
determines in good faith, following consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to

five business days of Thoratec\'s       64     receipt of the

by Thoratec promptly following the receipt thereof), (iv) the board of
directors of TCA concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside

obligations to TCA\'s stockholders under applicable law and (v) TCA shall not
have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.2 or this

stock of TCA on terms that the board of directors of TCA determines, in its
reasonable good faith judgment (based on the written advice of its financial
advisor) to be more favorable to the TCA stockholders than the terms of the
Merger, provided that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "TCA
Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not fully committed.    (f) Nothing in this

party to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger or
consolidation involving Thoratec pursuant to which the shareholders of
Thoratec immediately preceding such transaction hold less than a majority of

stock of Thoratec on terms that the board of directors of Thoratec
determines, in its reasonable good faith judgment (based on the written
advice of its financial advisor) to be more favorable to the Thoratec
shareholders than the terms of the Merger, provided that any such offer shall
not be deemed to be a "Thoratec Superior Offer" if any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
fully committed.   (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit TCA or its
board of directors or Thoratec or its board of directors from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.   (h) As promptly as

66     Statement with the SEC. Thoratec and TCA shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to have the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Thoratec shall also
take any action required to be taken under applicable state blue sky or
securities laws in connection with Thoratec Common Stock to be issued in
exchange for the shares of TCA Common Stock. Thoratec and TCA shall promptly
furnish to each other all information, and take such other actions
(including, without limitation, using all commercially reasonable efforts to
provide any required consents of their respective independent auditors), as
may reasonably be requested in connection with any action by any of them in
connection with the preceding sentences of this Section 5.4(h). Whenever any
party learns of the occurrence of any event which is required to be set forth

be voted) all the shares of TCA Common Stock held directly or indirectly by
it in favor of this Agreement and the Merger at the TCA Special Meeting and

that obligation if, but only if, the TCA board of directors withholds or
withdraws its recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(e).  5.5
Commercially Reasonable Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, Thoratec, Merger Sub, TEC and TCA shall use their

business, product line or assets, (ii) take any action or accept any
limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Thoratec Material
Adverse Effect or a TCA Material Adverse Effect or (iii) agree to any of the
foregoing in order to effect or facilitate the Merger.  5.6 Public
Announcements. Before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, Thoratec, Merger Sub, TEC and TCA shall
consult with each other as to its form and substance, and agree not to issue
any such press release or general communication to employees or make any
public statement prior to obtaining the consent of the others (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable law or by the rules and regulations of or listing agreement with
Nasdaq, The American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or as may
otherwise be required by Nasdaq, The American Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange or the SEC.  5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. TCA and TEC
shall promptly notify Thoratec, and Thoratec shall promptly notify TCA and
TEC, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the respective
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any condition
to the obligations of the notifying party to effect the Merger not to be
fulfilled. TCA and TEC shall give prompt notice to Thoratec, and Thoratec
shall give prompt notice to TCA and TEC, of any communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection

68     5.8 Indemnification.   (a) The articles of organization and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Thoratec shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor, the provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation that are substantially identical to those
set forth in the articles of organization and bylaws of TCA as of the date of
this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnified
Parties. In addition, Thoratec shall guarantee the obligations of TCA
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between TCA and any of the
Indemnified Parties. "Indemnified Parties" shall include each person who is
or was a director or officer of TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA at any
time before the Effective Time, and each person who serves or has in the past
served at the request of TCA or any subsidiary of TCA as a director, officer,
trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at any time before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Thoratec\'s and the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations set forth
in this Section 5.8(a) are in all respects conditioned upon TEC\'s
performance of its obligations set forth in Section 5.8(b).   (b) For a
period of six years after the Effective Time, TEC shall maintain in effect
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are
(as of the Closing) or at any time before the Closing were directors
or officers of TCA or any of TCA\'s Subsidiaries on terms comparable to those
of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy currently
maintained by TEC. Thoratec shall reimburse TEC for the costs of that policy
not to exceed $75,000 per year.   (c) Each Indemnified Party shall comply
with the reasonable requests of the Surviving Corporation or Thoratec in
defending or settling any action hereunder, provided that no proposed
settlement of any such action need be considered by any Indemnified Party
unless (A) such settlement involves no finding or admission of any liability
by any Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided in connection with
such settlement is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Surviving
Corporation or Thoratec.  5.9 Affiliate Agreements. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery hereof, TCA shall deliver to Thoratec a list
(reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Thoratec), setting forth the names of
all persons who are expected to be, at the Effective Time, in TCA\'s
reasonable judgment, Affiliates of TCA. TCA shall furnish such information
and documents as Thoratec may reasonably request for      
69     the purpose of reviewing such list. TCA shall deliver a written
agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto (a "TCA Affiliate

Affiliate in the list furnished pursuant to this Section 5.9 within ten days
after the execution of this Agreement.  5.10 Nasdaq Listing. Prior to the

to TEC\'s rights under the Shareholder Agreement, prior to the Effective Time
TCA shall deliver to Thoratec at no cost the resignations of such directors
and officers of TCA and its Subsidiaries as Thoratec shall specify at least
ten business days prior to the Closing, effective at the Effective
Time.  5.12 Consents of Thoratec\'s and TCA\'s Accountants. Each of Thoratec
and TCA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent
accountants to deliver to Thoratec a consent, dated the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Thoratec and customary in scope and substance for consents
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  5.13
Ancillary Agreements. Concurrently with the execution hereof, TEC
and Thoratec are executing and delivering the Shareholder Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement.  5.14 Form S-8. No later than 10 days

Thoratec true and complete copies of each report, registration statement or
statement mailed by it to its security holders generally or filed by it with
the SEC, in each case subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time. As of their respective dates, such reports, including the
consolidated financial statements included therein, and statements (excluding
any information therein provided by Thoratec or Merger Sub, as to which TCA
makes no representation) will not contain any untrue      
70     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in

in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (y) shall be

case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the
SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) and (z) shall fairly present the
consolidated financial position of TCA and its Subsidiaries in all material
respects as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount.   (b) Thoratec will deliver promptly to TCA true and
complete copies of each report, registration statement and other statement
mailed by it to its security holders generally or filed by it with the SEC,
in each case subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.
As of their respective dates, such reports, including the consolidated
financial statements included therein, and statements (excluding any
information therein provided by TCA, as to which Thoratec makes no
representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and will comply in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of law. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in such
reports (x) shall comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, (y) shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the
Exchange Act) and (z) shall fairly present the consolidated financial
position of Thoratec and the Thoratec Subsidiaries in all material respects
as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount.      71     5.16 Employee Benefit Matters.  
(a) With respect to the "401(k) plan" maintained by TEC in which employees of
TCA and its Subsidiaries participate, effective as of the Closing TEC
shall cause the accrued benefits of such employees under that plan to be
fully vested and immediately distributable to or on behalf of those employees
to the full extent permitted by law. As soon as practicable after the
Closing, Thoratec shall cause the employees of TCA and its Subsidiaries to be
eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan maintained by Thoratec and to
allow such employees to elect to roll over their distributable accrued
benefits under the 401(k) plan maintained by TEC, including any outstanding
loans of such employees, to Thoratec\'s 401(k) plan.   (b) The current
severance policy of TCA and its Subsidiaries with respect to their employees
is set forth in the TCA Employee Policy and Procedure Manual (the January
2000 version, as modified September 27, 2000), a copy of which has been
provided to Thoratec. After the Closing, Thoratec shall cause TCA and
the Subsidiaries of TCA to honor that policy for qualifying terminations
of employment, occurring within 12 months after the Closing, of persons who
are employed by TCA or any such Subsidiary just before the Closing. Nothing
in this Section 5.16(b) shall in any manner diminish TCA\'s Parent\'s
obligations referenced in Section 3.14(f).   (c) With respect to the
participation of employees of TCA and its Subsidiaries in the Thoratec
Welfare Plans, Thoratec shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition limitations, (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, such employees with respect to similar plans
maintained by TCA immediately before the Closing and (iii) recognize all
credited service for purposes of eligibility and level of benefits to the
same extent such service was recognized under similar plans maintained by TCA
immediately before the Closing. Thoratec shall make appropriate
arrangements to allow the use by TCA employees of any accrued benefits under
any cafeteria plan (as defined in Section 125 of the Code) which was
maintained by TCA or any of its Subsidiaries for such employees.   (d)
Thoratec shall provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and any other applicable law and to
otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in that act) or similar event affecting employees
of TCA or any TCA Subsidiary and occurring after the Closing.       
72      (e) Thoratec shall provide any required notice under COBRA for
any persons employed by TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA.  5.17 Notification of
Certain Matters. TCA and TEC shall give prompt notice to Thoratec, and
Thoratec shall give prompt notice to TCA and TEC, of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be
likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) any material failure of the TCA or TEC, Thoratec or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (iii) any
notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is or may be required in connection with any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) any facts or circumstances arise that
could reasonably be expected to result in an TCA Material Adverse Effect or a
Thoratec Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.  5.18 Relinquishment
of Name. Within 60 days after the Closing, TCA shall cease, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to cease, using the name "Thermo" or any confusingly similar
name in its business and operations. However, TCA and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to remove the "Thermo" name from any products or product
components that are in inventory as of the Closing or that are completed
within one year after the Closing. Nothing in this Section 5.18 shall require
that TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA cancel any order for any product, product
component, literature or other item that includes the "Thermo" name, placed
before the Closing, if its doing so would constitute a breach of
any obligation or result in any requirement to pay any material termination
or cancellation fee. Without time limit, Thoratec, TCA and the Subsidiaries
of TCA shall be permitted to explain that TCA is the same company that was
formerly named "Thermo Cardiosystems Inc." and that TCA\'s Subsidiaries are
subsidiaries of that company.  5.19 Special Retention Agreements. Upon
request by Thoratec including, if Thoratec so requests, promptly after this
Agreement is signed, TCA shall cooperate with Thoratec: (a) to adopt a
written retention plan, containing such terms and conditions as Thoratec
shall prescribe (subject to the consent of TCA, which Thoratec shall not
unreasonably withhold), for the benefit of those of TCA\'s and TCA\'s
Subsidiaries\' key employees whom Thoratec identifies with TCA\'s assistance,
under which (subject to whatever further conditions Thoratec may prescribe)
rights will vest if and when the Merger closes and (b) shall deliver a copy
of that plan to those employees.        73     5.20 Cooperation in
Tax Matters. Until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, TEC and TCA shall each: (i) provide the other with
such assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation or amendment of any Tax Return or in connection with any audit or
other examination by any taxing authority or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liability for any Taxes respecting any period ending
on or before the Closing Date or that otherwise includes the Closing Date,
(ii) retain and provide the other with any records or other information that
may be relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, examination, proceeding or
determination and (iii) provide the other with any final determination of any
such audit, examination, proceedings or determination that affects any amount
required to be shown on any such Tax Return. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, TEC and TCA shall each retain, until the applicable
statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have expired, copies of
all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other records and information
that may be relevant to such Tax Returns as may be necessary to allow it to
satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.20 and shall not destroy or
otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the other with
a reasonable opportunity to review and copy them. To the extent
TEC reasonably requests, TCA and Thoratec shall agree to maintain
the confidentiality of any information furnished by TEC under this Section
5.20, provided that TCA and Thoratec may use such information in connection
with any Tax Return of Thoratec, TCA or any Subsidiary of TCA, any
communication to or from any taxing authority, and in connection with any
controversy regarding any Taxes payable or paid by Thoratec, TCA or any
Subsidiary of TCA. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing,
during the period ending 60 days after the Effective Time TEC shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure for TCA and TCA\'s Subsidiaries any
tax benefit to which they are entitled as a result of any settlement or other
agreement between TEC and any tax authority.  5.21 Environmental Insurance.
Thoratec may choose to assess, before the Closing, whether to purchase so-
called "environmental insurance" with respect to one or more of the
properties that are occupied by TCA or Subsidiaries of TCA. If Thoratec does
choose to make that assessment, TEC and TCA shall cooperate with Thoratec to
assist that assessment including, for example, by permitting one or more
representatives of Thoratec or prospective insurers to inspect
those properties and records relating to those properties, provided that
that inspection shall not extend beyond those non-invasive procedures and
steps that comprise a so-called "ASTM Phase I Environmental Site Assessment"
and provided further that, before the Closing, any information generated by
such inspection shall not be disclosed to any Governmental Entity or third
party, other than a prospective insurer, except and only to the extent
required by law. Nothing in       74     this Section 5.21 shall be
construed to diminish any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III including, for example, those set forth in Section 3.20.  5.22
ITC Patent. ITC holds U.S. Patent No. 5731212 (the "Patent"). TEC
has requested that ITC grant a license under the Patent to TEC or an
affiliate of TEC that is not TCA or a Subsidiary of TCA. However, Thoratec
has not as yet had an opportunity to assess whether that is an appropriate or
desirable course of action for ITC. Accordingly, promptly after this
Agreement is signed, TEC will give Thoratec access to ITC personnel and
information relevant to the Patent and its applications in order to enable
Thoratec to make that assessment. Thoratec will make that assessment in good
faith and a commercially reasonable manner. Thoratec will then advise TEC
whether Thoratec is prepared to license the Patent to TEC or such an
affiliate and, if so, in what field or fields of use, in which case Thoratec
and TEC shall then, in good faith, exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to negotiate such a license.    ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS TO THE
OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY     The respective obligations of each party to
this Agreement to effect the Merger shall be subject to the fulfillment on or
before the Effective Time of each of the following conditions, any one or
more of which may be waived in writing by all the parties hereto:  6.1
Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall have
become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act. No
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall
have been issued by the SEC and remain in effect and no proceedings for such
purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the SEC.  6.2 TCA

TCA Common Stock for adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger shall have been obtained at the TCA Special Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof.  6.3 Thoratec Shareholder Approval. The approval of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Thoratec Common Stock in favor of the

postponement thereof.  6.4 Listing of Additional Shares. The shares of
Thoratec Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger shall have been
approved for listing on Nasdaq.  6.5 Governmental Clearances. The waiting
periods applicable to consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated. Other than the filing of the Articles of Merger
which shall be accomplished as provided in Section 1.2, all authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, or
expirations of waiting periods imposed by, any Government Entity the failure
of which to obtain or comply with would be reasonably likely to have a TCA
Material Adverse Effect or a Thoratec Material Adverse Effect shall have been
obtained or filed.  6.6 Tax Matters. Each of Thoratec and Merger Sub shall
have received an opinion of Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe LLP, counsel to
Thoratec and Merger Sub, and TCA shall have received an opinion of Hale and
Dorr LLP, counsel to TCA, each such opinion dated as of the Effective Time,
substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinions, (i) the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (ii) each of
Thoratec, Merger Sub and TCA will be a party to such reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; and (iii) except with respect to
cash received in lieu of fractional share interests in Thoratec Common Stock
or upon the exercise of dissenters\' appraisal rights, no gain or loss will
be recognized, for United States federal income tax purposes, by a
stockholder of TCA as a result of the Merger with respect to the shares of
TCA Common Stock converted into Thoratec Common Stock. If counsel to either
Thoratec or TCA does not render such opinion, this condition
shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied with respect to such party if
counsel to the other party renders such opinion in the required form to such
party.  6.7 Statute or Decree. No writ, order, temporary restraining order,
preliminary injunction or injunction shall have been enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced by any court or other tribunal or governmental body
or authority, which remains in effect, and prohibits the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise makes it illegal, nor shall any Government Entity have
instituted any action, suit or proceeding which remains pending and which
seeks to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  6.8 TCA Dissenting Shares.
Holders of shares of TCA Common Stock shall not have satisfied the

to effect the Merger shall be subject to the fulfillment of each of the
following additional conditions, any one or more of which may be waived in
writing by TCA:   (a) The representations and warranties of Thoratec and
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct, in all
material respects as of the Effective Time, with the same force and effect as

herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreements, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.  8.3 Fees and Expenses.   (a) General. Except as set forth in
this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the TCA
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the fees for
filings under the HSR Act) shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated, provided that: (i) Thoratec and TCA
shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys\' and

or supplements thereto and (ii) TEC shall pay all of Thoratec\'s and TCA\'s
fees and expenses incurred in putting in place and implementing the

Payments. If this Agreement is terminated by Thoratec or TCA, as applicable,
pursuant to Sections 8.1(d) or (f) or TCA breaches Section 5.4(e) or TEC
breaches Section 5.4(k), then TCA and TEC (jointly and severally)
shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of
such termination, pay Thoratec a fee equal to $12 million in immediately
available funds (the "TCA Termination Fee"). TCA and TEC acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Thoratec would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if TCA and TEC fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Thoratec makes a
claim that results in a judgment against TCA or TEC for the amounts set forth
in this Section 8.3(b), TCA and TEC shall pay to Thoratec its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in

to Sections 8.1(e) or (g) or Thoratec breaches Section 5.4(f), then Thoratec
shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such
termination, pay TCA a fee equal to $12 million (in the case of a termination
under Section 8.1(g) or a breach under Section 5.4(f)) and $3 million (in the
case of a termination under Section 8.1(e)) in immediately available funds
(in either such case, the "Thoratec Termination Fee"). Thoratec acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(c) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, TCA and TEC would not have entered into is
Agreement. Accordingly, if Thoratec fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such
payment, TCA or TEC makes a claim that results in a judgment against Thoratec
for the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3(c), Thoratec shall pay to TCA
and TEC their respective reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.3(c) at the prime rate of
The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.       84      ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS    9.1

consideration to be received by TCA\'s stockholders in the Merger.  9.2

Merger Sub (with respect to any failure by TCA or TEC), respectively, only by

such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section
