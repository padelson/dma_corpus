Notice of Disagreement and that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall
be mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, but

   

shall not be any firm providing services to Buyer, Seller or any of their
respective subsidiaries within the preceding five (5) years. If Seller and
Buyer are not able to mutually agree upon an accounting firm that is willing
and able to serve in such capacity, then Buyer shall within five (5) days
deliver to Seller a listing of three (3) other accounting firms of nationally
or regionally recognized standing in the U.S. and Seller shall within five (5)
days after receipt of such list, select one of such three (3) accounting firms
to act as the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert,
not as an arbitrator.

 

(c)In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.03(b), the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to make its final determination on all
matters within fifteen (15) days of its appointment.

 

(d)The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to the Disputed EBITDARM Items that were submitted to the Accounting
Firm in accordance with Section 2.03(b). The Accounting Firm's determinations
must be within the range of the amounts asserted by Seller and Buyer, and if
they would otherwise be outside such range, then they will be deemed to be
equal to the closer of Seller's or Buyer's amounts asserted.

 

(e)The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to
it pursuant to Section 2.03(b) shall: (i) be in writing, (ii) include the
Accounting Firm's determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.03(b) and (iii) be conclusive and binding upon Seller and Buyer for
all purposes hereunder in the absence of manifest error. Seller shall revise
the EBITDARM Statement to reflect the final determination by the Accounting
Firm of the Disputed EBITDARM Items.

 

(f)The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.03
shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer, which fees and expenses shall be
determined by the Accounting Firm and communicated to Seller and Buyer at the
time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted.

 

(g)In connection with the determination of LTM EBITDARM pursuant to this
Section 2.03, following receipt of the EBITDARM Statement, Seller shall
provide to Buyer and its independent accountants, until final determination of
LTM EBITDARM, upon reasonable advance written notice, reasonable access during
normal working hours to the facilities, Seller's and the Company Entities'

(a)No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting

Seller's calculations, explanations and assumptions for the calculations of
the amounts contained in the Closing Statement and (y) with final invoices
from the payees of the Company Transaction Expenses

(b)At 3:31 a.m. Pacific Time on the Closing Date (or at such other day or time

Gaming Laws), a physical inventory of all cash at the Real Property (including
cash in the cage and cash on the floor) (the "Cage Cash") to which the Company
Entities have ownership shall be conducted by, at Buyer's election, (i) Piercy
Bowler Taylor and Kern Certified Public Accountants or (ii) the Company
Entities, under the supervision of Representatives of Buyer (the "Cash
Count"), which inventory shall be conducted in accordance with the policies,
procedures and methodologies mutually agreed by the Parties and otherwise in
accordance with applicable Gaming Laws. Buyer, Seller and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to observe the taking of such physical
inventory. The Closing Statement, including the calculation of Closing Working
Capital therein, pursuant to Section 2.05 will reflect the amount of Cage Cash
as shown by the Cash Count and neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to
use any other value for Cage Cash other than as determined by the Cash Count.
The fees and expenses of Piercy Bowler Taylor and Kern Certified Public
Accountants, if any, in connection with the Cash Count will be borne by Buyer.

 

Section 2.05Cash Consideration Adjustment.

 

(a)As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but in any event

"Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date stating that Seller
disputes one or more items contained in the Closing Statement (a "Disputed
Item") and specifying in reasonable detail each Disputed Item. If Seller
delivers a Notice of Disagreement, then Buyer and Seller shall seek in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Items during the thirty-day (30-day) period
beginning on the date Buyer receives the Notice of Disagreement (the
"Resolution Period"). If Buyer and Seller reach agreement with respect to any
Disputed Items, Buyer shall revise the Closing Statement to reflect such
agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all Disputed Items
during the Resolution Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly thereafter
submit, in the form of a written brief, to the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator.

 

(c)In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.05(b), the
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to make its final determination on all
matters within thirty (30) days of its appointment.

   

(d)The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to the Disputed Items that were submitted to the Accounting Firm in

it pursuant to Section 2.05(b) shall: (i) be in writing, (ii) include the

Seller and Buyer, which fees and expenses shall be determined by the
Accounting Firm and communicated to Seller and Buyer at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

 

(g)If the Final Cash Consideration (as finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.05):

 

(i)is less than the Estimated Cash Consideration, Seller shall, within five
(5) Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the
Parties, at Seller's option either (a) make payment to Buyer in U.S. dollars
by wire transfer in immediately available funds equal to the amount of such

(ii)is greater than the Final Cash Consideration, Buyer shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the
Parties, make payment to Seller in U.S. dollars by wire transfer in

be required pursuant to this Section 2.05.

 

Any payment under this Section 2.05(g) shall be treated as an adjustment to

determination of the Final Cash Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.05,
(i) following receipt of the Closing Statement, Buyer shall provide to Seller

Consideration, upon reasonable advance notice, reasonable access during normal
working hours to the facilities, books and records, personnel and accounts of
the Company Entities and the working papers of Buyer, the Company Entities and
Buyer's

   

independent accountants relating to the Closing Statement, and (ii) following
the Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its independent accountants,
until final determination of the Final Cash Consideration, upon reasonable
advance notice, reasonable access during normal working hours to the
facilities, Seller's books and records, personnel and accounts of Seller and
the working papers of Seller and Seller's independent accountants to the
extent relating to the Closing Statement.

 

Allocation of Purchase Price

 

.

 

(a)Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.06, Buyer shall prepare a
schedule (the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule") allocating an amount equal
to the payments made (including the Cash Consideration and the Issued Shares),
and expenses incurred and Liabilities deemed assumed, in connection with this
Agreement that is treated as the purchase price for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes (the "Tax Purchase Price") among the assets deemed to be purchased by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. The entire Tax Purchase Price and any
adjustment thereto will be allocated for all U.S. federal income Tax purposes
among the assets of the Company Entities. Such allocation shall be consistent
with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and any similar provisions of state or local Laws, as
applicable, as well as the respective purchase price values associated with
the assets acquired by the Company Entities' pursuant to their exercise of the
rights to purchase set forth in Section 7.4 of the Company Ground Lease
Agreement and Section 16 of the Company Personal Property Lease Agreements.
Buyer shall adjust the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule from time to time to
account for any adjustments to the Purchase Price provided in this Agreement,
which adjusted Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be provided in draft
form and finalized as provided in Section 2.06(b). The Parties shall take no
position contrary to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule in any Tax Return
or other Tax filing or proceeding; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon
or arising out of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, and none of Buyer,
Seller or their respective Affiliates shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority challenging
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule; provided further that it will not be
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule for (i) Buyer's cost
for the assets deemed purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement to differ
from the total amount allocated in the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to
reflect capitalized acquisition costs not included in the Tax Purchase Price,
(ii) the amount realized by Seller to differ from the Tax Purchase Price to
reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes and (iii) Buyer's and Seller's cost and amount realized,
respectively, to differ from the Tax Purchase Price to take into account
differences between the Purchase Price and the Tax Purchase Price, and any
other payments to Seller treated as purchase price for the assets deemed
purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, and any adjustments to the foregoing hereunder. In the event that
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule is disputed by any Governmental
Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify
the other Party hereto concerning the existence and resolution of such
dispute. 

 

(b)Buyer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) a draft of the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule (and any adjustments thereto) to Seller for Seller's
review and comment no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
Closing, and shall consider all such

   

comments in good faith. If within thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of
the draft Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, Seller has not objected in
writing to such draft Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, then such draft
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall become the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject to adjustment from time to time
pursuant to Section 2.06(a)). In the event that Seller objects in writing
within such thirty-day (30-day) period, Buyer shall consider such objections
in good faith and shall negotiate with Seller in good faith to resolve any
outstanding disagreements. If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach agreement
within thirty (30) days after the date of Seller's notice of objection, then
(i) such dispute shall be resolved, and (ii) the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject to adjustment from time to time
pursuant to Section 2.06(a)) shall be determined by the Accounting Firm. The
final Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject to adjustment
from time to time pursuant to Section 2.06(a)), as agreed upon by Buyer and
Seller or otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 2.06(b), shall be
final and binding upon the Parties subject to the provisions of Section
2.06(a). Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear all of their own respective
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the determination of the
final Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as it may be subject to adjustment
from time to time pursuant to Section 2.06(a)), except that Buyer and Seller
(collectively) shall each pay one-half (50%) of the fees, costs and expenses
of the Accounting Firm, if any.

 

Withholding. 

 

Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller or any other Person
such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment; provided, that Buyer
shall notify Seller in writing promptly upon becoming aware of any such
requirement and shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to eliminate or reduce
any such withholding requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

Closing

 

. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the purchase and
sale of the Membership Interests contemplated hereby shall take place at a
closing (the "Closing") to be held on the third (3rd) Business Day after the
last of the conditions of Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied
or waived (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions
at the Closing) or at such other time as Seller and Buyer may agree in
writing, pursuant to an exchange of signature pages, documents, and other
items required hereunder by means of electronic submission; provided, that in

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or similar contract (including any contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Buyer and any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries in Buyer's or such subsidiary's published financial statements or
other Buyer SEC Documents.

plan information, regarding the Company Entities and their respective
businesses and operations. Buyer hereby acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, with which Buyer is familiar,

projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-
related plans), except as provided in Article III.

any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided in Article III, and

are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 5.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Laws in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Laws. The covenants contained in
this Section 5.07 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct
covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction. Any
breach of this Section 5.07 by (x) an Affiliate of Seller or a direct or
indirect equityholder of Seller or (y) any of their respective Representatives

   

acting on their behalf shall, in each case, constitute a breach of this
Section 5.07 as if such breach was committed by Seller directly.

Affiliate Transactions

 

. 

 

(a)Except as set forth on Section 5.14 of the Disclosure Schedules, Seller
shall cause all Affiliate Transactions to be terminated and of no further
force and effect as of the Closing in a manner such that none of Buyer, the
Company Entities or any of their respective Affiliates has any Liability or
obligation pursuant to such Affiliate Transactions. 

 

(b)Seller shall cause the Company Entities to take all necessary actions to
exercise their respective rights to purchase set forth in Section 7.4 of the
Company Ground Lease

   

Agreement and Section 16 of each Company Personal Property Lease Agreement,
and perform their respective obligations upon exercise thereof (other than, if
applicable in accordance with this paragraph, the payment of the purchase
price with respect thereto), such that all assets subject to such agreements
shall be owned by the applicable Company Entity as of the Closing, free and
clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). Seller shall
either (i) cause the Company Entities to deliver prior to Closing the
applicable purchase price upon exercise of such rights to purchase, or (ii)
record the applicable purchase price upon exercise of such rights as
Indebtedness in the Closing Indebtedness Estimate such that such amounts will
be paid at Closing in accordance with the applicable Payoff Letters. Any fees
and expenses associated with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the exercise of the rights to purchase discussed above that will be
Liabilities of either Company Entity shall either be (A) paid by Seller or the
Company Entities prior to the Closing, or (B) treated as Company Transaction

(c)Except as set forth on Section 5.14(c) of the Disclosure Schedules, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities) to,
transfer into the Company Entities' name(s) (as applicable), those Contracts,

conduct of the business of a Company as currently conducted (including those
applicable Contracts, assets or rights (x) set forth in Section 3.11 of the
Disclosure Schedules or (y) used in or related to the Laughlin River Regatta).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or
agreement by Seller to assign any Contract that by its terms or by Law is non-
assignable without the consent of a third party or is cancelable by a third
party in the event of an assignment (a "Non-Assignable Contract"), unless and
until consent from such third party has been obtained. With respect to all
Non-Assignable Contracts, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Buyer at its request for up to eighteen (18) months following
the Closing Date in endeavoring to obtain such consents; provided, however,
that such efforts shall not require Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur
any expenses or Liabilities, provide any financial accommodation, or remain
secondarily or contingently liable for any Liability to obtain any such
consent and any failure to obtain any consent by Seller for any reason in and
of itself shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Contracts, in
the event that consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such
Non-Assignable Contracts shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by
Seller for the benefit of the Company Entities, and the covenants and
obligations thereunder shall be performed by the Company Entities at the
Company Entities' expense and in Seller's name, and all benefits and
obligations existing thereunder shall be for the Company Entities' account
(and Seller shall promptly pay over to the Company Entities (as applicable)
all money received by it under such Non-Assignable Contracts in respect of
periods after the Closing Date); provided, that Seller may, after providing
prior written notice to Buyer with reasonable detail, withhold any performance
under a Non-Assignable Contract that may otherwise be reasonably requested by
Buyer until Buyer or the Company Entities shall have provided Seller with all
funds and other resources necessary for such performance. As of and from the
Closing Date, Seller authorizes the Company Entities, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Contracts, at the
Company Entities' expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the
benefits of Seller under the Non-Assignable Contracts. Buyer agrees to
indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities and Losses solely to the
extent first arising out of or relating to the Company Entities' performance

   

of, or failure to perform, obligations under the Non-Assignable Contracts
after the Closing. In addition to the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Company Entities to, take all actions within its control and
reasonably necessary to cause the Contract set forth on Section 5.14(c) of the
Disclosure Schedules to remain in full force and effect for at least six (6)
months following the Closing Date at no cost to Buyer for such six-month
period. 

 

Employee Matters

 

. Prior to the Closing, the Company Entities and Seller shall, in
consultation with Buyer, take such action as is commercially reasonable to (i)
have the Company Entities cease participation in all Benefit Plans that are
maintained or sponsored by Seller ("Seller Plans") other than the Seller Plan
that is a defined contribution plan subject to Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"Seller 401(k) Plan"), (ii) have all Benefit Plans in which employees of the
Company Entities participate (other than the Seller 401(k) Plan) be sponsored
and maintained by one or all of the Company Entities ("Company Entity Benefit
Plans"), and (iii) provide that only employees of the Company Entities will be
eligible to participate in the Company Entity Benefit Plans. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Seller will cause the Seller Plans to spin-off and transfer all
assets and Liabilities associated with the employees of the Company Entities
to the Company Entity Benefit Plans prior to the Closing. Following the
Closing, Seller shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause employees
of the Company Entities to cease participating in the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

Listing of Issued Shares

 

. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Issued
Shares to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject only to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

 

Financing Cooperation

 

. Seller agrees to provide such assistance (and to cause the Company Entities
and its and their respective Representative to provide such assistance) with
the Debt Financing as is reasonably requested by Buyer. Such assistance shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: (a) reasonable assistance with
the preparation of marketing materials related to the Debt Financing; (b)
timely delivery to Buyer and its respective financing sources of any financial
information or other deliverables reasonably required to obtain the Debt
Financing; and (c) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Buyer or
its financing sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all
conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing. Seller hereby consents
to the use of all of the Company Entities' logos in connection with the Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such assistance shall not require
Seller or the Company Entities to take any action that would unreasonably
interfere with its ongoing business operations, subject any of the Company
Entities to any Liability that is not conditioned upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or result in the Company Entities agreeing
to any contractual obligation relating to the Debt Financing that is not
conditioned upon the Closing, and Buyer shall reimburse Seller and the Company
Entities for all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the actions taken at Buyer's request pursuant to this Section 5.17.

 

Financial Statements

 

. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Company Entities for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017 and the related consolidated statements of income, members'
equity and cash flow for the fiscal year then ended, prepared in accordance
with GAAP and audited by independent accountants qualified under AICPA (the
"Auditors") and (ii) unaudited consolidated balance

   

sheets for the Company Entities for any fiscal quarter ended at least forty
(40) days prior to the Closing Date and the related consolidated statements of
income, members' equity and cash flow for the fiscal quarters then ended,
reviewed by the Auditors. Commencing January 1, 2019, Seller shall prepare in
accordance with GAAP, and instruct Auditor to commence auditing, consolidated
balance sheets of the Company Entities for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2018 and the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity and
cash flow for the fiscal year then ended to be delivered to Buyer no later
than the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) March 15, 2019. The cost of
the preparation of the foregoing financial statements by shall be borne by
Seller.

 

Further Assurances

 

. Following the Closing, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further actions as may
be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Permit Cooperation

 

. From and after the date hereof, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
Entities and its and their respective Representatives to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits in the name of each Company necessary
for the Company Entities to host, conduct and otherwise operate the Laughlin
River Regatta in 2018 and for future years to the extent such Permits can
reasonably be obtained as multi-year Permits. To the extent such Permits
cannot reasonably be obtained as multi-year Permits, or the Permits are issued
to a Person other than the Company Entities, then from and after the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and its Representatives to obtain such Permits in future years or
to otherwise put in place arrangements between the Company Entities and the
applicable Person holding such Permits to allow the Company Entities to host,
conduct or otherwise operate the Laughlin River Regatta in accordance with
applicable Law.

 

Completion of Certain Matters Prior to Closing

 

. From and after the date hereof, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the work set
forth on Section 5.21 of the Disclosure Schedules. To the extent such work is
not completed to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to the Closing, the
cost to complete such work (such amount, as reasonably determined by Buyer,
the "Work Completion Costs") shall reduce the amount of Working Capital on a
dollar-for-dollar basis as set forth in the definition of Working Capital.

(a)Without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably

Affiliates and their respective Representatives) shall not (i) make, change or
rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return, settle or compromise any
Action relating to Taxes or consent to any extension or waiver of any statute
of limitations period relating to Taxes as such election, Action, extension or

registration, value added and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with

when due. Seller shall, at its own expense, timely file (taking into account
any applicable extensions) any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Taxes (and Buyer shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company Entities) shall be responsible for all Taxes arising out of the
transactions contemplated by Section 5.14(b).

further rights or Liabilities thereunder.

 

Tax Returns

taxable period that is deemed to end on the day prior to the Closing

   

Date will be: (i) in the case of all real property Taxes, personal property
Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as
though the taxable year of the Company Entities terminated at the close of
business on the day prior to Closing Date. In the case of doubt, the close of
business of each Company shall be equal to the closing of each entity's Gaming
day, as provided by the Gaming Authorities.

written notice to Seller, of the receipt of any written notice which involves
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Action, in respect of
which an indemnity relating to any Tax may be sought by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement (a "Tax Claim"); provided, that failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect Buyer's or Seller's right to indemnification
hereunder. Seller shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim;
provided, however, that Seller shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such
claim; and, provided further, that Buyer shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely
by Buyer.

taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to extensions, except to the extent
notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective

"Buyer Indemnitee") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred, sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a)any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of

Indemnification By Buyer

 

. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article VIII, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and defend each of Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees" and individually a "Seller Indemnitee") against, and shall hold
each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of
them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Seller
Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a)any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(b)any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; or

 

(c) any Liability of either Company Entity solely to the extent (i) first
arising after the Closing and (ii) not subject to indemnification by Seller
pursuant to Section 8.02.

 

Certain Limitations

 

. The indemnification provided for in Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be
subject to the following limitations:

 

(a)Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Basket"), at
which time Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for all such Losses
from the first dollar; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
to any breach or alleged breach of any Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in the last sentence of Section
3.20(a) or Section 3.21.

 

(b)Buyer shall not be liable to Seller Indemnitees for indemnification under
Section 8.03(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.03(a), exceeds the Basket, at which time Buyer
shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for all such Losses from the first
dollar; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any breach
or alleged breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.01 or Section 4.04.

 

(c)Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the maximum Liability
of Seller and Buyer for Losses under Section 8.02(a), respectively, shall be
$12,500,000 in the aggregate; provided, that the obligations of Seller to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for Losses resulting from a breach or alleged
breach of any Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.21 shall be capped at the Purchase Price.
Furthermore, indemnification claims pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or Section
8.03(a) must be brought within the applicable survival periods set forth in
Section 8.01.

   

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
8.04 shall not apply to Losses as a result of fraud or willful
misrepresentation. Solely with respect to actions grounded in fraud or
willful misrepresentation, (A) the right of a party to be indemnified and held
harmless pursuant to the indemnification provisions in this Agreement shall be
in addition to and cumulative of any other remedy of such party at law or in
equity and (B) no party shall, by exercising any remedy available to it under
this Article VIII, be deemed to have elected such remedy exclusively or to
have waived any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, available to it.

 

(e)For purposes of this Article VIII, the amount of Losses incurred by the
applicable Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee as a result of any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty shall each be determined
without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty.

 

(f)The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts
under indemnification agreements actually received by the Indemnified Party on
account of such Loss. The existence of a claim by an Indemnified Party for
monies from an insurer or other party shall not, however, delay any payment
pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise
determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party. Rather, the
Indemnifying Party shall make timely payment of the full amount of Losses
determined to be due and owing by it, and if the Indemnified Party later
actually recovers insurance or other proceeds in respect of such Losses then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party to the
extent necessary to avoid double recovery of the same Losses. The Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under
all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as such
Indemnified Party would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. Any deductible or increase in insurance premiums attributable to
claims made shall be indemnifiable Losses.

 

Indemnification Procedures

 

. The party making a claim under this Article VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are asserted under
this Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party".

 

(a)Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving

   

written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim that (x) seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party, (y) relates to any criminal or quasi-
criminal matter or (z) the Indemnified Party is reasonably advised by outside
counsel chosen by it that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that Indemnifying Party cannot assert on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it
shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that
if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there
are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel
is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to or is not permitted
under this Section 8.05(a) to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making available (subject to the provisions of Section 5.06) records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b)Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) except as provided
in this Section 8.05(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required if all of the following conditions are
met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnified Party by the third
party of a release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Law or guilt by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof), and (iii)
the sole form of relief is monetary damages which are paid in full by or on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c)Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than forty-five (45)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such

   

Direct Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access to each Company's premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty-day (30-day) period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

Payments

 

. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days of such final, non-
appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Indemnified Party; provided, that, if Seller is the Indemnifying Party, at
Seller's option, Seller may satisfy its payment obligations pursuant to this
Section 8.06 by transferring to an Indemnified Party a number of Issued Shares
(rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to (x) the amount of such
obligations divided by (y) the Signing Share Price (it being agreed that, for
the avoidance of doubt, if Seller does not hold a sufficient number of Issued
Shares to fully satisfy its payment obligations pursuant to this Section 8.06,
then it shall remain obligated to pay any such remaining payment obligations
in cash).

 

Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments

 

. All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by
the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Laws.

 

Effect of Investigation

 

. Except as set forth in Section 8.08 of the Disclosure Schedules, the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or
by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any
condition set forth in Section 7.02 or Section 7.03, as the case may be.

 

Release

 

. As a material inducement to Buyer's willingness to enter into and perform
this Agreement and to purchase the Membership Interests for the consideration
to be paid or provided to Seller in connection with such purchase, as of the
Closing, Seller, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and direct or
indirect equityholders and its and their respective successors and assigns
(each, a "Releasor"), does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree and
covenant

   

not to sue or prosecute against the Company Entities, their respective
subsidiaries and Buyer and each of their respective Representatives,
Affiliates, equityholders, directors, members, managers, employees, agents,
officers successors and assigns (each, a "Releasee") and hereby forever
waives, releases and discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law each Releasee from any and all Actions or Liabilities whatsoever, that
such Releasor now has or hereafter may have, of whatsoever nature and kind,
whether known or unknown, whether now existing or hereafter arising, whether
arising at law or in equity, against any or all of the Releasees, solely to
the extent based on facts, whether or not now known, existing on or before the
Closing Date and solely to the extent relating to the Company Entities, their
respective subsidiaries or their respective businesses; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall operate to release, waive or discharge any
obligation of Buyer, or otherwise restrict or limit any rights of Seller,
arising under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection herewith (including the Transaction Documents). 

 

Exclusive Remedies

 

. The Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal
activity or willful misconduct on the part of a Party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.10 shall limit any Person's
right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be
entitled under Section 10.10 hereof or to seek any remedy on account of any
Party's fraudulent, criminal or intentional misconduct.

 

Article IX. 
Termination

 

Termination

 

. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a)By the mutual written consent of the Parties;

 

(b)By any Party:

 

(i)If there shall have been any breach by the other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition to
the Article VII hereunder and (B) either (1) cannot be cured or (2) has not
been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice from the other Party
of such intent to terminate prior to the Outside Date;

 

(ii)If a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall
have issued an Order or Law or taken any other action, in each case
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and such
Order, Law or other Action shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any Party whose

   

failure to comply with Section 5.08 has been the primary cause of such Order,
decree, ruling or other Action; or

 

(iii)If the Closing shall not have occurred by July 14, 2019 (the "Outside
Date"); provided, however that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.01(b)(iii) shall not be available if the failure of the Party
so requesting termination to fulfill any material obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date.

 

Effect of Termination

 

. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event of a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Article
IX, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no Liability
on the part of any Party hereto (or any direct or indirect equityholder,
stockholder, partner, controlling Person, member, manager, Affiliate or
Representative of such Party or such Party's Affiliates or any of the
foregoing's successors and assigns) except:

 

(a)the provisions set forth in this Section 9.02 and Article X shall remain in
full force and effect; and

 

(b)that nothing herein shall relieve any Party hereto from Liability for any
willful and intentional breach of any representation herein, or any breach of
an agreement or obligation hereof prior to such termination.

 

Article X.

letter dated May 3, 2018, executed by Buyer and the letter agreement dated May
4, 2018, executed by Buyer and Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement shall supersede or terminate the Parties' respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate at Closing with
respect to confidential information of the Company Entities, but shall remain
in effect in accordance with its terms with respect to confidential
information of Seller. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the other Transaction
Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in
the body of this Agreement will control.

 

Successors and Assigns

 

. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither
Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer may, without the prior written consent of Seller, (a) assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries or (b) collaterally assign its rights
hereunder to its Debt Financing sources or any collateral agent or trustee
therefor. No assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its
obligations hereunder, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignor
shall remain liable in all respects as a co-obligor for all obligations of
such assigning Party set forth herein or in any Transaction Document.

 

No Third-party Beneficiaries

 

. Except as provided in Article VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit
of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns
and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Amendment and Modification; Waiver

 

. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an
agreement in writing signed by each Party hereto. No waiver by any Party of
any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in
writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege arising

   

from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

 

Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

 

.

 

(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction).

 

(b)ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW
YORK, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS,
NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN
SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE
ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN
SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH
COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.09(C).

 

Specific Performance

 

. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even
if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge

   

and agree that (a) each of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without proof of damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties are entitled under
this Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement in favor of Buyer and
Seller is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and without that right, neither of the Parties would have entered into this
Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that neither Buyer nor Seller, when seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and/or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.10, shall be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
Action.

 

Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and
the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile,
e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the
same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

 

Limitation on Recourse

 

. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly named as
Parties, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth in
this Agreement. No former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, Representatives, members,
managers, Affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of any Party or
of any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
Person, stockholder, Representative, member, manager, general or limited
partner, Affiliate, or assignee of any Party shall have any Liability or
obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
obligations or Liabilities of such Party under this Agreement or of or for any
Action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate such
transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited liability company or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a Party or another Person or otherwise.

 

Conflict Waiver; Privilege

 

. Buyer and Seller agree that, notwithstanding any current, future, or prior
representation of any of the Seller, or the Company or any of its Affiliates
by Holland and Hart LLP ("HandH"), HandH shall be allowed to represent Seller or any
of Seller's respective Affiliates in any matters and/or disputes (or any other
matter), including any matter or dispute adverse to Buyer or the Company
Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates, that either is existing on
the date hereof or that arises in the future and relates to this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or thereunder, and Buyer (for itself and, for all periods after the
Closing, the Company Entities) and Seller hereby (a) waive any claim they have
or may have that HandH has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such representation, and (b) agree that, in the event that a
dispute

   

arises after Closing between Buyer, the Company Entities, or either of their
respective Affiliates (on the one hand) and Seller or any of Seller's
respective Affiliates (on the other hand), HandH may represent Seller or such
Affiliate of Seller in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or
such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company Entities, or any
of their respective Affiliates, and even though HandH may have represented a
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer (for itself
and, for all periods after the Closing, the Company Entities) also further
agrees that, as to all communications among HandH and Seller, the Company
Entities, and any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder, including all right, title and interest
in and to such communications, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence, and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong
to and may be controlled exclusively by Seller and shall not be deemed to have
ever been conveyed, passed to, or claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or, following the Closing, by the Company Entities, as it relates to the
contemplation, negotiation or drafting of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (including preparation of the Disclosure Schedules).
Accordingly, no Person other than Seller controls the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such communication or is able to waive the
privilege.
