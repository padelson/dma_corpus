AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 6, 2013 (the " _Agreement_
"), by and among Reliance Steel and Aluminum Co., a California corporation ("

 _W I T N E S S E T H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ")
unanimously has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement,
(ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this

to enter into this Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under
Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street,

Day after (or, if Parent elects, in its sole discretion, any other day
specified by Parent that is within seven (7) calendar days after) the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other place, date
and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing.

      
 

 



 

The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

 



 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9(a), at the Effective Time: (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such
certificate of incorporation; provided that, at the Effective Time, such
certificate of incorporation shall be amended as set forth in Annex II; and
(b) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to the
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal.

 



 

Section 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of the Company as of the Effective Time
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "),
including all Restricted Shares, but excluding (i) Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and (ii)
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
$20.65 per Share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest.
All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically
cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly by
the Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 



 

(c) _Subsidiary-Owned Shares_. Each Share held by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger
Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no
par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(e) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for
such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of Shares and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare (or, if Computershare is
unavailable, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by
Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as a paying agent
hereunder) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of
the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration; _provided_ that
with respect to any holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and who appears at the
Closing in person or by authorized representative, the Paying Agent shall
provide the letter of transmittal and instructions for use to such holder at
the Closing.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration,
paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof,
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Share.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Each of the Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective agents, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (A) shall be remitted
by the applicable entity to the appropriate Governmental Entity within the
period required under applicable Law and (B) shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the holder of Certificates
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section
2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders
of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this
Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied
by the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



       
 

 



 

(h) _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period
(but excluding in any event the effect of any dividends or distributions
permitted under Section 5.1(b)(i), any change that results from any exercise
of options to purchase shares of capital stock granted under the Companys
stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that are outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement or granted in accordance with this Agreement and
any issuance of Restricted Shares in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(vii)), the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Shares_.

 



 

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company Option. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five calendar days following the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Each Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (without
regard to the satisfaction of any performance condition, vesting or other
lapse restriction) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement

Section 3.4. _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports
required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC
on a timely basis since April 2, 2010 (together with any documents so filed or
furnished during such period on a voluntary basis, in each case as may have
been amended since their filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). Each of the
Company SEC Documents, including all Company SEC Documents filed after the
date hereof, as of its date, or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the
date of this Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the date filed with the SEC, none of
the Company SEC Documents, including all Company SEC Documents filed after the
date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act,
as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no
material outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect
to any of the Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (if amended,
as of the date of the last such amendment), fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto). None of the Subsidiaries of the
Company is required to file periodic reports with the SEC.

 



 

(c) Section 3.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter describes, and the Company
has made available to Parent copies of the documentation creating or
governing, all securitization transactions and other off-balance sheet
arrangements (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities

April 2, 2010.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) The Company has established, implemented and maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" and "internal controls over financial reporting" (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP.

 



      
 

 



 

The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company have made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and the statements
contained in all such certifications were as of their respective dates true,
complete and correct. The Companys management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, from April 2, 2010
to the date hereof, the Company has not failed to disclose to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company
has made available to Parent a summary of any such disclosure made to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since April 2, 2010.

 



 

(b) Since April 2, 2010 through the date of this Agreement, (i) except as
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any director, officer, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any auditor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director
or executive officer of the Company.

 



 

Section 3.6. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012 (or the notes thereto), (b) as incurred
in connection with this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations that
have been incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2012 and (d) for liabilities or obligations that
have been discharged or paid in full, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that have had or would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.7. _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of the Companys Subsidiaries are, and since April 2,
2010 have been, in compliance with, and are not, and since April 2, 2010 have
not been, in default under or in violation of, any applicable federal, state,
local, municipal, common law, international or foreign law, statute, treaty,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, mandatory policy,
binding directive, decree or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ ") or with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules of the NYSE, except where such
noncompliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of the Company to consummate
the Merger. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company,
the Company and each of the Companys Subsidiaries are not, and since April 2,
2010 have not been, under investigation with respect to and have not been
threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation of, any
applicable Law or with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
of the NYSE, except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
impair or delay the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, registrations, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity (the " _Company Permits_ ") necessary for the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted,
except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair or delay the ability
of the Company to consummate the Merger. All Company Permits are in full force
and effect, no default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) has
occurred under any such Company Permit, and none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any such Company Permit, in
each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
impair or delay the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger.

 



 

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees or any other Persons acting on their behalf has, at any time during
the last five years, in connection with the operation of their respective
businesses, (i) used any corporate or other funds for unlawful contributions,

Practices Act or any other similar applicable foreign, federal or state law,

embargoes and sanctions, except in the case of clauses (i)-(iii), as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(e) The foregoing notwithstanding, the representations and warranties in this
Section 3.7 shall not be deemed to be made with respect to the Companys
compliance with, or Company Permits with respect to: (i) Environmental Laws,
Hazardous Substances and any other environmental matter or (ii) Tax matters.

potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions contemplated by

the Company and its Representatives shall have the right to: (i) initiate,
solicit, facilitate and encourage Alternative Proposals, including by way of
providing access to non-public information (subject to entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with each recipient); _provided_ that any
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available by the Company to any Person given such access
which was not previously provided or made available to Parent shall be
provided to Parent substantially concurrently if such information is written,
or otherwise, promptly thereafter (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours), and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with
respect to Alternative Proposals or any other proposals that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such requests, proposals,

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3, and except with respect to
any Person who made a written Alternative Proposal received prior to the
Solicitation Period End-Date ( _provided_ that the Person making such proposal
has not informed the Company that it has abandoned or withdrawn such
Alternative Proposal), which the Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal
(any Person so submitting such Alternative Proposal, for so long as such
Person has not informed the Company that it has abandoned or withdrawn such
Alternative Proposal, an " _Excluded Party_ "), as of the Solicitation Period
End-Date, or with respect to any Excluded Party, upon the date (if any) that
such party ceases to be an Excluded Party, the Company shall and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all solicitation or intentional encouragement of Alternative Proposals from,
and discussions or negotiations with respect to Alternative Proposals with,
any Person conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company or any of its or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives and (ii) promptly request any such Person to promptly return
or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement
between the Company and such Person. Subject to the provisions of this Section
5.3, and except with respect to an Excluded Party, from the Solicitation
Period End-Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the Company shall not and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (it being understood and agreed
that ministerial acts that are not otherwise prohibited by this Section 5.3
(such as answering unsolicited phone calls) shall not be deemed to
"facilitate" or "encourage" for purposes of this Section 5.3(b)) the
submission of any Alternative Proposal, (B) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic
information regarding an Alternative Proposal to, any Person that has made or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, is seeking to make, an Alternative Proposal,
except to notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.3, (C) enter into any letter of intent, agreement, contract or
agreement in principle regarding an Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(a) or (e), an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")) or (D) publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing (other than disclosure of the terms of this Agreement).

 



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, the Board of Directors
shall not (i) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Recommendation, (ii) subject to Section 5.3(f), take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or (iii)
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to
the stockholders of the Company an Alternative Proposal (such prohibited
actions being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Within forty-eight (48) hours after the Solicitation Period End-Date, the
Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of the identity of each Excluded
Party, if any, and provide Parent a copy of each Alternative Proposal received
from each Excluded Party (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed written description of such Alternative Proposal). From and after the
Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company shall promptly (within twenty-four
(24) hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Representatives receives any request for discussions or negotiations, any
request for access to the properties or books and records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives is or has become aware, or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
by any third party that may be considering making, or has made, an Alternative
Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal or request and the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any. Following the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis (and in
any event within forty-eight (48) hours) of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposals (whether made
before or after the date hereof) or any material change to the financial or
other terms of any such Alternative Proposal.

 



 

(e) Anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(i) if the Company receives a written Alternative Proposal which the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisers and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, if,
and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives
from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions
as to confidential treatment of information that are substantially similar to
the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided_ , that any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided or
made available by the Company to a third party given such access which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives shall
be provided to Parent substantially concurrently, if such information is
written, or otherwise promptly thereafter (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours); and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third
party with respect to the Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company
shall, prior to or substantially concurrently with providing any such non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to such third
party, provide to Parent a copy of any Alternative Proposal made to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by such third party and the identity of
such third party (for the avoidance of doubt, prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company shall in any event be permitted to take the
actions described in clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) above with respect to any
Excluded Party for so long as such party remains an Excluded Party, and from
and after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no person shall be
an Excluded Party); and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the Board of Directors may (A) effect a Change of Recommendation, if it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but, in the case of
clause (ii)(A) if the Change of Recommendation does not relate to or result
from a Superior Proposal, only if the Company provides reasonable prior notice
to Parent, or in the case of clause (ii)(B), or clause (ii)(A) if the Change
of Recommendation relates to or results from a Superior Proposal, only if
prior to taking any such action:

 



 

(1) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisers and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment or
revisions proposed by Parent in response to such Alternative Proposal
(including pursuant to clause (3) below));

 



 

(2) the Company has given Parent, at least four (4) calendar days (or two (2)
Business Days, whichever period is longer) in advance of taking such action,
prior written notice of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement (the " _Notice Period_ ") and has contemporaneously
provided to Parent a copy of such Superior Proposal and each of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements to be entered into by the Company with the
third party making such Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(3) at the end of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
shall have determined in good faith that the third partys Alternative
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (taking into account any modification or changes committed
to by Parent); _provided_ , that each time material modifications to the
material terms of an Alternative Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal
are made, a new written notification from the Company consistent with that
described in clause (ii)(2) of this Section 5.3(e) shall be required and a new
Notice Period under clause (ii)(2) of this Section 5.3(e) shall commence,
during which notice period the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii) anew, except that such new Notice
Period shall be for two (2) Business Days (as opposed to four (4) calendar
days); and

 



 

(4) in the case of clause (ii)(B), in advance of or substantially concurrently
with termination of this Agreement, the Company has paid the Termination Fee
to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending
disclosure of its position thereunder (provided, however, that any disclosure
other than a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of an applicable Alternative Proposal or an express reaffirmation of
the Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation); or (ii)
making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer made by any Person for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person
of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, including any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning Shares with fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, in each case of clauses (i)-(iii), other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a written
Alternative Proposal, substituting "fifty percent (50%)" for "fifteen percent
(15%)," that the Board of Directors determines in good faith and considering
such factors as the Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (including
the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any governmental or other
approval requirements, break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to consummation and availability of necessary financing), to be
more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Proxy; Company Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof), subject to the
receipt from Parent and Merger Sub of the information described in the second
sentence of this clause (a), the Company shall prepare (in consultation with
Parent and giving due consideration to any comments made by Parent) and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include
the Recommendation, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
respond (in consultation with Parent and giving due consideration to any
comments made by Parent) as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall
furnish all information concerning themselves and their Affiliates that is
required to be included in the Proxy Statement, or that is customarily
included in a proxy statement prepared in connection with transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
(or any other filings) shall not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Company Meeting_ "), with the record date and meeting date of the Company
Meeting to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii)
subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement and the Merger to the Companys stockholders at the Company Meeting
whether or not a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred.

(a) For the period from the Effective Time until December 31, 2013, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former

base compensation and bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less
favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and benefits (including equity)
**** that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee
who experiences a Qualifying Termination during the period from the Effective
Time until December 31, 2013, severance benefits equal to the greater of (1)
the severance benefits set forth in Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (2) the severance benefits provided for under the severance
arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (B) during such period from
the Effective Time until December 31, 2013, severance benefits offered to each
Company Employee shall be determined without taking into account any reduction
after the Effective Time in compensation paid to such Company Employee. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Qualifying Termination_ " means a termination
of employment under circumstances that would entitle the applicable Company
Employee to severance benefits under the applicable severance plan or
arrangement described in this Section 5.5(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting (other than equity
awards), eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to participation in and benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension or post retirement plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and further provided that the foregoing provision shall
not preclude the Parent from confirming the eligibility of any such employee
or his or her covered dependents after the Effective Time, and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
the amount of eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents which were credited to deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
co-insurance requirements under the Old Plans will be credited for purposes of
satisfying the deductible, and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance requirements
under the New Plans, provided that the foregoing provision shall not be
applicable with respect to any of the New Plans which have a plan year which
commences on January 1, 2014.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.10, the provisions of this
Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee, other service provider or
independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement
for any purpose or to confer upon any Company Employee any right to continued
employment. Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall supersede or conflict with any
Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, or
expirations or terminations of waiting periods as may be required by any law
or Governmental Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof, file (or cause to be filed) any and all
required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger; Parent and the Company shall request early termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act, and shall supply to the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ ") or the United
States Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested
pursuant to any Law or by the Antitrust Division or the FTC.

 



 

(c) In furtherance of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section
5.6, but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.6(d), (i) each of
the Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated or lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the
End Date and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law so as to enable
the Closing to occur as promptly as possible (and in any event no later than
the End Date), including, in the case of Parent, proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product
lines or assets of Parent or the Company and otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that after the Closing would limit Parents freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to operate and/or retain, one or more of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or the Company.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6, the parties
hereto understand and agree that neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without
the prior written consent of Parent agree or offer to: (i) sell, divest or
otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or
take any other action (or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing) with
respect to any of the businesses, assets or properties of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii)
otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit
Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to operate any of
the businesses, assets or properties of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates if the aggregate net effect
of all such sales, divestitures, dispositions, actions or commitments referred
to in clauses (i) and (ii) would be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being understood that if any such actions
are proposed with respect to the assets or business of Parent, "material"
shall be determined as if such assets or business were owned by the Company).

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.6, and,
subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised on
a current basis of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other material communications received by Parent and
the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent and
the Company shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written
communications or submissions, and with respect to any such notification,
filing, written communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith
to any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that materials may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the
Parent, or proposals from third parties with respect thereto, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Parent and the
Company agree not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Public Announcements_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
or anyone acting on their behalf, shall issue any press release or other
public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity
(in which case, the party issuing the press release, public statement or
comment shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give the other party
the opportunity to review and comment upon such press release or other public
statement or comment prior to issuance); _provided_ that the restrictions in
this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an
Alternative Proposal or a Change of Recommendation. Parent and the Company
agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement in a form to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of
expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company as provided in the Company certificate of incorporation, the Company
bylaws or any indemnification contract between such directors or officers and
the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), without further
action, as of the Effective Time and all such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

 



      
 

 



 

For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of
such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, guarantee
and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.9.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who
served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, member, trustee
or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any matters, whether before or after
the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including acts
or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as officer,
director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other entity if such
services was at the request of the Company of the Company); _provided_ , that
any Person to whom any funds are advanced pursuant to the foregoing must
provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such
Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance, with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions
contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
hereunder; provided, however, that the Company shall not pay in excess of 250%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of such "tail" policy.

 



       
 

 



 

If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required
to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have

documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly
reimburse each Indemnified Party for any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by any such Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnification or other obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
this Section 5.9 (including Section 5.9(b)) unless it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to the benefit of such indemnification or
other obligation.

 



 

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Notice of Certain Events_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, each of the Company, on the one hand and Parent,
on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of: (a) the discovery of
any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of the other party contained in this Agreement
at any time during the term hereof that, in the case of a fact or circumstance
discovered by the Company, could reasonably be expected to cause the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied on or before the End Date or,
in the case of a fact or circumstance discovered by Parent, could reasonably
be expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be
satisfied on or before the End Date; and (b) any failure of the other party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder that, in the case of a failure to comply
with or satisfy a covenant discovered by the Company, could reasonably be
expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) not to be
satisfied on or before the End Date or, in the case of a failure to comply
with or satisfy a covenant discovered by Parent, could reasonably be expected
to cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied on or
before the End Date; _provided_ __ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its

advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE
and SEC to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Common
Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten days after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Financing Cooperation_. Upon the request of Parent, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with Parents efforts to arrange and consummate any
amendment to, or replacement or supplement of, Parents credit facilities ("
_Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ that such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Such commercially reasonable efforts shall include, to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) make available to
prospective lenders, on a customary and reasonable basis and upon reasonable
notice, appropriate personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b)
provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to any financing institutions contemplated to

_Financing Sources_ ") (including information to be used in the preparation of
a customary information package regarding the business, operations, financial
condition, projections and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries

reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing Sources to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents to be used for the
completion of the Debt Financing, (c) assist in the obtaining of customary
payoff letters and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing to

Anything in this Section 5.13 to the contrary notwithstanding, until the
Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective officers or directors, as the case may be, shall (i)
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (ii) enter into any
definitive agreement or have any liability or any obligation under any
certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the Debt Financing, (iii) unless
promptly reimbursed by Parent, be required to incur any other expenses in
connection with the Debt Financing or (iv) be required to take any action in
his/her capacity as a director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out of pocket

its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with their
respective obligations pursuant to, and in accordance with, this Section 5.13,

Section 7.3. _Termination Fee_. Any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding,

 



 

(a) In the event that:

 



 

(i) after the date of this Agreement, (A) any Alternative Proposal
(substituting fifty percent (50%) for the fifteen percent (15%) threshold set
forth in the definition of "Alternative Proposal") (a "Qualifying
Transaction") is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not
withdrawn prior to the time of, the Company Meeting, (B) this Agreement is
validly terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (1) Section 7.1(d) or
(2) Section 7.1(b) (and, in the case of this clause (B)(2), so long as (x)
prior to the time such Alternative Proposal was first publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed Parent shall not have delivered a notice to the Company in
accordance with Section 7.1(f) or Section 5.11 citing a failure of a condition
to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger set
forth in Section 6.3(a)(i) and (y) at the time of such termination, the
condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) shall not have been satisfied but all
other conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger
set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) have been satisfied) and (C)
concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Qualifying Transaction or consummated the transactions contemplated by a
Qualifying Transaction;

 



 

(ii) Parent shall have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(g) or 7.1(h); or

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(i),

 



 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or, at Parents
direction, an Affiliate of Parent) a fee of twenty-three million eight hundred
thousand dollars ($23,800,000) in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent, such
payment to be made, in the case of a termination referenced in clause (i)
above, upon consummation of the Qualifying Transaction, in the case of clause
(ii) above, within three (3) Business Days of such termination or, in the case
of clause (iii) above, in advance of or substantially concurrently with the
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(i); it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. The foregoing notwithstanding, the "Termination Fee"
shall be eleven million nine hundred thousand dollars ($11,900,000) in cash
solely in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company prior to
the thirtieth (30th) day after the Solicitation Period End-Date pursuant to
Section 7.1(i) to enter into a Qualifying Transaction with an Excluded Party.
Following receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 7.3, the Company shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or Merger Sub.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The parties agree and understand that (i) in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) in no
event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this Section 7.3, to receive an
amount greater than the Termination Fee. Anything to the contrary in this
Agreement notwithstanding, except in the case of fraud, (A) if Parent receives
the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3, such
payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against
the paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Affiliates and Representatives and none of the paying party, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (B)
if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of
any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3, the amount of such Termination Fee shall be
reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the
Termination Fee in respect of any such breaches. The parties acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 7.3 do not constitute a penalty. Accordingly, if any party fails
to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, such party shall
also pay any costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by the party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal
action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount
against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid
when due pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall bear interest from the date such
amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of
such payment.

 



 

(c) If the circumstances described in both Section 7.3(a)(i)(A) and Section
7.3(a)(i)(B) shall have occurred, but the Termination Fee, as of the time
Parent requests reimbursement pursuant to this Section 7.3(c), shall not have
become payable (as a result of the non-occurrence of events described in
7.3(a)(i)(C)), the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two (2) Business Days
after submission of reasonable documentation thereof, for 100% of their
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of their counsel) up to $5,000,000 actually incurred by any of them
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
including the arrangement of, obtaining the commitment to provide or obtaining
any financing for such transactions; provided that, to the extent that the
Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i), the
amount of such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any
fees and expenses actually paid to Parent and its Affiliates by the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.3(c), and following the payment of the Termination
Fee, as so reduced, if applicable, to Parent, the Company shall have no
further obligation under this Section 7.3(c).
