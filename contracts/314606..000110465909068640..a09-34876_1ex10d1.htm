with the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets by the Asset Sellers
except for Assumed Liabilities, and the Asset Sellers shall, and each Asset
Seller hereby agrees, to satisfy in due course all Retained Liabilities,

limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall be responsible for
any expenses incurred after the Closing Date related to the Excluded Assets.

Purchased Entity will cause the Unrelated Liabilities to be satisfied and

objects and (b) describe in reasonable detail the nature of such objection
and the Purchasers calculation of such disputed item.

immediately thereafter refer any such unresolved items (any such referred
item, a **_"Disputed Item"_** ) to Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other U.S.
nationally recognized independent accounting firm as may be approved by the
Sellers and Geokinetics (the **_"Auditors"_** ), which firm shall render its
opinion as to such Disputed Items. Based on such opinion, the Auditors will
then send to the Sellers and Geokinetics its written determination of the
Disputed Items, which determination shall be binding and conclusive upon, and
deemed accepted by, the parties. The fees and expenses of the Auditors shall
be borne one-half by the Sellers and one-half by Geokinetics.

 ** _Section 4.5_** Geokinetics SEC Reports.

  



  

(a) Geokinetics has filed with the SEC true and complete copies of the
Geokinetics SEC Reports. As of the respective dates the Geokinetics SEC
Reports were filed or, if any such Geokinetics SEC Reports were amended,
as of the date such amendment was filed, each Geokinetics SEC Report,
including any financial statements or schedules included therein, (a)
complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of

  



        
   

  



  

the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (b) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No event since the date of the last Geokinetics SEC Report
has occurred that would require Geokinetics to file a Current Report on Form
8-K other than the execution of this Agreement. Each document filed with
the SEC by Geokinetics that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of
the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading. None of Geokinetics Subsidiaries is or has been
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC that have
not been filed. The reports of Geokinetics independent auditors regarding
Geokinetics consolidated financial statements in the SEC filings have not
been withdrawn, supplemented or modified, and none of Geokinetics or any of
the Subsidiaries has received any communication from its independent auditors
concerning any such withdrawal, supplement or modification.

  



  

(b) The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Geokinetics
have made all certifications (without qualification or exceptions to the
matters certified) required by, and would be able to make such certifications
(without qualification or exception to the matters certified) as of the
Effective Date and as of the Closing Date as if required to be made as of
such dates pursuant to, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct; neither Geokinetics nor its officers
has received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification.  Geokinetics is in substantial compliance
with all applicable listing standards of the NYSE AMEX.

  



  

(c) Geokinetics maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of reliable financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets; (iii) records are maintained in
sufficient detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of Geokinetics assets; (iv) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (v)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

  



  

(d) Geokinetics is not aware of (a) any significant deficiency in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting that could
adversely affect Geokinetics ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data or any material weaknesses in internal controls over
financial reporting or (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Geokinetics
internal controls. There have been no significant changes in internal

  



        
   

  



  

controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls since December 31, 2008.

ended September 30, 2009 (collectively, the **_"Geokinetics Financial

the books and records of Geokinetics and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
subject, in the case of quarterly financial statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments) and fairly present, in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), the consolidated financial position of Geokinetics and its
Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows (and changes in financial position, if any) of
Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein (subject

case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

Geokinetics SEC Reports, or as contemplated by this Agreement,
since September 30, 2009, (a) Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries
have conducted its and their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and (b) there has not been
any change or development, or combination of changes or developments
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.9_** **_Compliance with Applicable Laws._** Except as would
not result in a Purchasers Material Adverse Effect, each of the respective
businesses of Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in
violation of any Law, including any Law relating to occupational health and
safety, and to Purchasers Knowledge, none of Geokinetics or its Subsidiaries
has received since January 1, 2006 any notice from any Person that such
business has been or is being conducted in violation of any Law, including
any Law relating to occupational health and safety.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.10_** **_Independent Accountants._** UHY, LLP, which has

 ** _Section 4.11_** **_No Material Actions or Proceedings._** There are no
Legal Actions pending or, to Purchasers Knowledge, threatened (i) against or
affecting Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) that has as the
subject thereof any property owned or leased by, Geokinetics or any of its
Subsidiaries, where in any such case any such Legal Action, if so determined
adversely, would result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. No material
labor dispute with the employees of Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries
exists or, to Purchasers Knowledge, is threatened or imminent.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.12_** **_Intellectual Property Rights._** Geokinetics and
its Subsidiaries own or possess sufficient trademarks, trade names, patent
rights, copyrights, licenses, approvals, trade secrets and other similar
rights (collectively, " ** _Intellectual Property Rights_** ") reasonably
necessary to conduct their businesses as now conducted; and the expected
expiration of any of such Intellectual Property Rights, if not renewed or
replaced, would not result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.  Neither
Geokinetics nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of
infringement or conflict with asserted Intellectual Property Rights of
others, which infringement or conflict, if the subject of an
unfavorable decision, would result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.13_** **_All Necessary Permits, etc._** Geokinetics and
each Subsidiary possess such valid and current Permits issued by the
appropriate Governmental Authority necessary to conduct their respective
businesses, and neither Geokinetics nor any Subsidiary has received any
notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of, or non-
compliance with, any such Permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the
subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result in a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.14_** **_Title to Properties._** Geokinetics and each of
its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all the properties and
assets reflected as owned in the financial statements included in the

Reports"_**) at the time of such reports, in each case free and clear of any
Liens, except for Permitted Liens and Liens under the Second Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, by and among Geokinetics,
the Subsidiaries named therein and PNC Bank, National Association. The real
property, improvements, equipment and personal property held under lease by
Geokinetics or any Subsidiary of Geokinetics are held under valid and
enforceable leases, with such exceptions as are not material and do not
materially interfere with the current or currently proposed use of such real
property, improvements, equipment or personal property by Geokinetics or such
Subsidiary.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.15_** **_Taxes._** Geokinetics and its subsidiaries have
filed all necessary federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax
returns and have paid all taxes required to be paid by any of them and, if
due and payable, any related or similar assessment, fine or penalty levied
against any of them. Geokinetics has made adequate charges, accruals and
reserves in the financial statements included as part of the 2009 Geokinetics
SEC Reports in respect of all federal, state and foreign income and franchise
taxes for all periods as to which the tax liability

  



        
   

  



  

of Geokinetics or any of its subsidiaries has not been finally determined.
 There are no audits, adjustments, assessments or other proceedings
with respect to Taxes of Geokinetics or any of its subsidiaries except as
listed on _Section 4.15_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.16_** **_Investment Company._**  Neither Geokinetics nor any
of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the **_"Investment
Company Act"_** ), and each of Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries intends to
conduct its respective business in a manner so that it will not become
subject to regulation as an "investment company" under the Investment Company
Act.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.17_** **_Insurance._** Each of Geokinetics and its
Subsidiaries are insured by recognized, financially sound institutions with
policies in such amounts and with such deductibles and covering such risks as
are generally deemed adequate and customary for their respective businesses
including, but not limited to, policies covering real and personal property
owned or leased by Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries against theft,
damage, destruction, acts of vandalism and earthquakes.  Geokinetics has no
reason to believe that it or any Subsidiary will not be able (i) to renew its
existing insurance coverage as and when such policies expire or (ii) to
obtain comparable coverage from similar institutions as may be necessary or
appropriate to conduct its business as now conducted and at a cost that would
not result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Neither of Geokinetics nor
any Subsidiary has been denied any insurance coverage which it has sought or
for which it has applied.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.18_** **_No Unlawful Contributions or Other Payments._**

Knowledge, any employee or agent of Geokinetics or any Subsidiary of
Geokinetics, has made any contribution or other payment to any official of,

Law or of the character necessary to be disclosed in the Geokinetics SEC
Reports in order to make the statements therein not misleading.

Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries received any written communication,
whether from a Governmental Authority, citizens group, employee or otherwise,
that alleges that Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of

personal injuries, attorneys fees or penalties arising out of, based on or
resulting from the presence, or release into the environment, of Hazardous
Materials at any location owned, leased or operated by Geokinetics or any of
its Subsidiaries, now or in the past, pending or, to Purchasers
Knowledge, threatened against Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(iii) to Purchasers Knowledge, there are no past or present actions,
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including,
without limitation, the release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal of

  



        
   

  



  

any Hazardous Materials, that reasonably could result in a violation of any
Environmental Law by Geokinetics or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.20_** **_ERISA Compliance._** Except as could not result in a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, (i) Geokinetics and its subsidiaries and

maintained by Geokinetics, its Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates are in
compliance in all material respects with ERISA; (ii) no "reportable event"
(as defined under ERISA) has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with

Geokinetics, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates; (iii) no
"employee benefit plan" established or maintained by Geokinetics, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, if such "employee benefit
plan" were terminated, would have any "amount of unfunded benefit
liabilities" (as defined under ERISA); (iv) neither Geokinetics, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur any liability under (a) Title IV of ERISA with respect to
termination of, or withdrawal from, any "employee benefit plan" or (b)
Sections 412, 4971, 4975 or 4980B of the Code. Except as could not result in a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, each "employee benefit plan" established
or maintained by Geokinetics, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code is
so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act,
that would cause the loss of such qualification. Except as could not result
in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, or except as disclosed in _Section
4.20_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
Transactions will not by themselves or in combination with any other event
(without regard to whether such event has or may occur) (i) cause any
Purchaser Plan to increase benefits payable to any participant or
beneficiary, (ii) entitle any current or former employee or director, or any
other service provider, of Geokinetics or any of its Affiliates to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, benefit or award under a
Purchaser Plan, or (iii) accelerate or modify the time of payment or vesting,

 ** _Section 4.22_** **_Disclosure Controls and Procedures._** Geokinetics
has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial
and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Geokinetics in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and regulations thereunder, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Geokinetics management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Geokinetics required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Geokinetics
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to enable it to record,
process, summarize, and report information required to be included in its
filings with the SEC within the required time period, and to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to its management,

  



        
   

  



  

including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

authorization of the payment of any money, or other property, gift, promise
to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any "foreign
official" (as such term is defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political
party or official thereof or any candidate for foreign political office, in
contravention of the FCPA or other Law, and Geokinetics and, to Purchasers
Knowledge, its Affiliates have conducted their businesses in compliance with
the FCPA and other Laws and have instituted and maintain policies and
procedures designed to ensure, and that are reasonably expected to
continue to ensure, continued compliance therewith.

  



  

 ** _Section 4.24_** **_Solvency. _**As of the Closing Date, Geokinetics and
each Purchaser, both before and immediately after consummation of the
Transactions, will not be insolvent, as insolvency is defined under any of
the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, as approved by the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1984, as amended (the
**_"UFTA"_** ) and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §101 et seq., as
amended (the **_"Bankruptcy Code"_** ). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as of the Closing Date, with respect to Geokinetics and each
Purchaser, both before and immediately after consummation of the
Transactions: (i) the sum of such entitys debts will not be greater than all

Bankruptcy Code); (ii) such entity will not intend to incur, or believe or
reasonably should believe that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
pay as they become due (as such terms are defined in the UFTA), and such
entity will not intend to incur, or believe that it would incur, debts that
would be beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature (as such terms are
defined in the Bankruptcy Code); and (iv) such entity will not be engaged and
will not be about to engage in a business or transaction for which the
remaining assets of such entity are unreasonably small in relation to such
business or transaction (as such terms are defined in the UFTA), and
such entity will not be engaged in business or a transaction, and will not be
about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property
remaining with such entity is an unreasonably small capital (as such terms
are defined in the Bankruptcy Code).

  



  

 ** _Section 4.25_** **_Availability of Funds. _**Geokinetics has delivered
to the Sellers true and complete copies of the executed Commitment Letter
related to the Bridge Financing.  The Commitment Letter has not been amended
or modified, no provision of the Commitment Letter has been waived, no such
amendment, modification or waiver has been agreed to or is contemplated, and
the commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. Geokinetics has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable
on or prior to the Effective Date. The Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Geokinetics and,
to Purchasers Knowledge, the other parties thereto and

  



        
   

  



  

does not restrict any transfer of the cash portion of the Purchase Price from
any of the Purchasers to the Sellers in connection with the Transactions. No
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Geokinetics or its Affiliates
under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the funding of the
full amount of the Bridge Financing, other than as set forth in the
Commitment Letter. Geokinetics and its Affiliates (as applicable) are in a
position to satisfy timely all conditions to be satisfied by them to fund the
Bridge Financing, and Geokinetics has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions relating to the funding of the full amount of the Bridge Financing
will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date. At the Closing, the
Financing, together with Geokinetics immediately available funds, in cash,
will be sufficient to provide the Business with sufficient working capital
and to pay all amounts payable by the Purchasers under this Agreement and to
effect the Transactions, all without any third-party consent or approval
required.

Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, access to the offices, employees, properties, books and records of
Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries (so long as such access does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Geokinetics) as Sellers
may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Law, Sellers will provide and
will cause the Purchased Entities and their respective Representatives to
provide Geokinetics and its authorized Representatives, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, access to the offices,
employees, properties, books and records of each Business Owning Entity

obligations under the Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement, dated
February 27, 2008, previously executed by Geokinetics and PGS Onshore, Inc.
(the **_"Confidentiality Agreement"_** ). No party shall be required to

would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such party or any
Subsidiary of such party or contravene any Contract or Law (it being agreed
that the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such
jeopardy or contravention).

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers and the Purchasers shall, and
shall cause the Business Owning Entities to, furnish each other with such

request, in each case (A) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or
other requirements imposed on the Sellers or Purchasers (including under
applicable securities Laws), (B) for use in any Legal Action or assessment or
in order to satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation,

Agreements, as the case may be.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.4_** **_Further Assurances._** Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals and to
do all other things necessary for the consummation of the Transactions. The
parties shall take such further action to deliver or cause to be delivered to
each other at the Closing and at such other times thereafter as shall be
reasonably agreed by such parties such additional agreements or instruments
as any of them may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out this
Agreement and the Transactions. Each party shall duly preserve all files,
records or any similar items received or obtained as a result of the
Transactions with the same care and for the same period of time as it would

 ** _Section 5.5_** Expenses.

  

 ** _ _**

Purchasers and their respective Affiliates. The Sellers shall bear solely
and entirely and shall pay all Expenses incurred by the Sellers and, except
as provided in the proviso to the next sentence, all Expenses incurred by the
Purchased Entities prior to Closing. If, following the Closing, a

  



        
   

  



  

Purchased Entity is invoiced for an Expense that was incurred by
such Purchased Entity prior to Closing, the Sellers agree to promptly pay
and reimburse the Purchased Entity for the amount of such Expense; _provided_
,  _however_ , that (i) the Sellers shall have no obligation to pay
or reimburse for any Expenses incurred by the Purchased Entities in
connection with the Financing or any Alternate Financing, including but not
limited to any such Expenses incurred to have the independent auditors for
the Business prepare "comfort letters," assist in the preparation of pro
forma financial statements or otherwise to assist as contemplated by Section
5.26(e) in the preparation of disclosure materials relating to the Financing
or any Alternate Financing (and any substitutions or replacements of either
the Financing or any Alternate Financing) and (ii) to the extent any Expenses
of the type described in clause (i) have the effect of reducing Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall pay or reimburse Sellers
for such Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then the allocable share of the Purchasers and
Sellers for all Expenses (including any fees and expenses of accountants,
experts, and consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses of legal
counsel and investment bankers) related to preparing, filing and payment of
fees incurred in connection with filings made under the HSR Act or any
other Competition Laws related to the Transactions shall be allocated one-
half each.

  



  

(b) **_"Expenses"_** as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of outside
counsel, accountants, auditors, financing sources, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates but excluding
any liability for Taxes) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection
with or related to the due diligence, authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, requisite filings
under the HSR Act and other Competition Laws and all other matters related to
the consummation of the Transactions (subject to reasonable documentation).

  



  

 ** _Section 5.6_** **_Cooperation._** Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, from the Effective Date until the Closing, (i) the Business Owning
Entities shall keep Purchasers designated representatives reasonably
informed about significant issues relating to the Business and the Purchased
Assets, (ii) the Purchasers shall keep Sellers designated
representatives reasonably informed about significant issues relating to the
business of Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries, the Geokinetics Common Stock
and the Financing, (iii) each party shall cooperate with and use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance to transfer any Permits
that must be transferred in connection with the Transactions and that are
required for the conduct of the Business and (iv) each party shall promptly
provide the other party or its counsel with copies of all filings (excluding
any confidential or privileged filings) made by such party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.7_** **_Publicity._** Neither Geokinetics, Sellers nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement, or otherwise make any public statements, with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with or rules and regulations of a national securities
exchange on which securities of Geokinetics or PGS are listed and traded, in
which case the party issuing or causing the publication of such press release
or other announcement, or making such statement, shall use

  



        
   

  



  

commercially reasonable efforts to provide copies thereof to the other
parties hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as each such
other party may have, prior to such release or other announcement or the
making of such statement.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.8_** **_Additional Actions._** Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, each party agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law, or to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays,
to consummate and make effective the Transactions.  Each of Sellers and
Purchasers agrees that, from and after the Effective Date and prior to the
Closing Date, and except as may be agreed in writing by the other or as may
be expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, it shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries, to make any acquisition, enter into any
agreement, or take any other action, or agree, in writing or otherwise, to do
any of the foregoing, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of the Transactions or result in the failure to satisfy any
condition to consummation of the Transactions

  



  

 ** _Section 5.9_** **_Filings; Competition Laws._** Each party shall make
all material filings such party is required to make in connection herewith or
desirable to achieve the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
cooperate as needed with respect to any such filing by any other party. Each
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions under the HSR Act and any other Laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization, restraint of trade or combinations (collectively, together
with the HSR Act, **_"Competition Laws"_** ). Each such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause or
obtain, if possible under the applicable Competition Laws, the expiration or
early termination of the applicable notice or waiting periods or favorable
ruling under the Competition Laws with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as possible after the Effective Date. Without limiting
the foregoing, each such party shall take any and all of the following
actions to the extent necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable
Competition Laws regarding the Transactions: (i) entering into negotiations,
(ii) providing information required by the applicable Competition Laws or by
competent competition authorities, and (iii) substantially complying with any
request (including any "second request") for information pursuant to the
applicable Competition Laws; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of the
Purchasers or the Sellers shall be required to dispose of any of their
respective assets or to limit their freedom of action with respect to any of
their respective assets or businesses, whether prior to or after the Closing
Date, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, in order to obtain any
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments
to the Transactions relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law or
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction or
other order in any suit or proceeding relating thereto, other than
dispositions, limitations, commitments, or agreements that in each such case
may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions and that in each
such case would not result in a material adverse effect on the
business, assets or financial condition of Geokinetics and its Subsidiaries
together with the Property taken as a whole as constituted after the Closing
Date. The filing fees incurred in connection with any filings respecting the
HSR Act and any other Competition Laws shall be an Expense as defined in
_Section 5.5_.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Section 5.10_** **_Consents._** Each of Geokinetics and Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents necessary in connection with its obligations hereunder.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.11_** Geokinetics Board of Directors.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause two
individuals whose names shall be provided by PGS to Geokinetics a reasonable
period of time prior to the Closing Date (the **_"Director Nominees"_** ) to
be appointed as members of Geokinetics board of directors by
Geokinetics existing board of directors simultaneous with Closing, subject
to applicable Law, _provided_ that at least one of such Director Nominees
is "independent" as defined by the rules of the NYSE AMEX and
Geokinetics policies. Each Director Nominee shall serve as a director for a
term expiring at Geokinetics next annual meeting of stockholders following
the Closing Date and until his successor is elected and qualified.
Geokinetics shall take such action, including amending its bylaws, as
required to cause the number of directors constituting Geokinetics board of
directors immediately after the Closing Date to be increased as necessary to
reflect the addition of the Director Nominees.

  



  

(b) If, on the date that the nominating committee of Geokinetics board of
directors meets to nominate directors for election at any annual meeting of
stockholders of Geokinetics, PGS and its wholly owned Subsidiaries own at
least 10% of the then outstanding shares of Geokinetics Common Stock,
Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the two Director
Nominees to be elected as directors of Geokinetics; _provided_ that at least
one of such Director Nominees is "independent" as defined by the rules of the
NYSE AMEX (or such other securities exchange on which the Geokinetics Common
Stock is then listed) and Geokinetics policies. If, on the date that the
nominating committee of Geokinetics board of directors meets to nominate
directors for election at any annual meeting of stockholders, PGS and its
wholly owned Subsidiaries own at least 5% but less than 10% of the then
outstanding shares of Geokinetics Common Stock, Geokinetics shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause one Director Nominee selected by PGS to
be elected as a director of Geokinetics.

  



  

(c) As a condition to its obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause a Director Nominee to be elected to Geokinetics board of directors,
Geokinetics may require each Director Nominee to provide to Geokinetics such
directors questionnaires and similar materials as the other members of
Geokinetics board of directors are required to complete.

  



  

(d) If at any time, a Director Nominee is unable or unwilling to serve as a
director, or PGS otherwise determines to replace a Director Nominee, PGS may
nominate another individual to serve in such individuals place and be a
"Director Nominee" hereunder; _provided_ that if PGS has the right to appoint
two directors to Geokinetics board of directors, at least one of the
Director Nominees is "independent" as defined by the rules of the NYSE AMEX
and Geokinetics policies.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to enter into an agreement with the Series B Holders, in which
the Series B Holders shall agree to take all action within their
power (including, but not limited to, (i) attending all stockholder meetings
of Geokinetics for the purposes of ensuring that a quorum is obtained
and (ii) voting all shares of Geokinetics Common Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock owned or held by the Series B Holders at any
stockholder meeting of Geokinetics or, if under applicable Law stockholders
of Geokinetics are permitted to take action by written resolution or consent
in lieu of a meeting, executing any written resolution or consent with
respect to all voting shares of Geokinetics owned by the Series B Holders) to
cause the Director Nominees to be elected or appointed as a member of the
board of directors of Geokinetics at each of the annual meetings of
stockholders of Geokinetics to be held in 2010 and 2011 following the Closing
Date. In addition, each of the Series B Holders shall agree to vote all
shares of Geokinetics Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock owned or held
by such Series B Holder and that such holders are entitled to vote against
any resolution that may be proposed at such meetings to remove any Director
Nominee that is serving as a member of the board of directors of Geokinetics,
unless PGS otherwise requests in writing.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.12_** Preemptive Rights.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Unless waived by the Sellers, if at any time Geokinetics authorizes the
issuance and sale of any shares of Geokinetics Common Stock or shares that
are convertible into or exercisable for Geokinetics Common Stock or that will
vote as a single class as Geokinetics Common Stock in a transaction exempt
from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D
thereunder, or in a "registered direct offering" pursuant to a registration
statement filed with the SEC directly to a limited number of investors (and
not through a placement agent or underwriter), then Geokinetics shall offer
to PGS the right to purchase a Pro Rata Number of Shares on the same terms as
other purchasers in the offering. A Pro Rata Number of Shares shall mean an
amount of securities so that the percentage of shares of Common Stock (on a
fully diluted basis) owned or deemed to be beneficially owned by PGS after
the offering is equal to the percentage of shares of Common Stock (on a fully
diluted basis) owned or deemed to be beneficially owned by PGS before such
offering. Geokinetics shall provide PGS such notice of the applicable
offering and related closing date as Geokinetics board of directors
determines is reasonable to facilitate the offering of securities, and PGS
shall have such time period as specified in such notice to agree to purchase
all or any portion of its Pro Rata Number of Securities in the offering on
the same terms as the other purchasers in the offering.

  



  

(b) Geokinetics board of directors may place such restrictions on the
preemptive rights granted to PGS in this section as the board determines is
reasonably necessary to facilitate a successful offering, provided that any
such restrictions are considered with the terms that apply to other investors
or potential investors in the particular offering.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable Law or the rules of any
securities exchange on which Geokinetics Common Stock is listed restrict or
prohibit, or adversely

  



        
   

  



  

condition or restrict the participation of PGS in any offering subject to
this _Section 5.12_, Geokinetics board of directors may vary the preemptive
rights provided herein, in its discretion, solely to comply with such Law or
securities exchange rule.

  



  

(d) The rights granted in this Section shall terminate on the date that PGS
and its wholly owned Subsidiaries own less than 10% of the outstanding shares
of Geokinetics Common Stock.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.13_** **_Stock Exchange Listing._**  Geokinetics shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Geokinetics Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement to be approved and admitted for listing on
the NYSE AMEX prior to Closing.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.14_** Employee Matters.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) On or before the Closing, Seller shall take any actions necessary to
cause the Purchased Entities to cease to be sponsoring, adopting or
participating employers, as applicable, of all Plans except the Purchased
Entity Plans listed in _Section 5.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Any Purchased Entity Plans listed in _Section 5.14_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule that, as of the Effective Date, are sponsored by
an Affiliate of Seller other than a Purchased Entity will be transferred to
and assumed by a Purchased Entity as of the Closing. Except as expressly
provided in the remaining paragraphs of this _Section 5.14_ and as set forth
in _Section 5.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (with respect to a
Purchased Entity Plan that is assumed by a Purchased Entity), Purchaser shall
not, and from and after the Closing Date the Purchased Entities shall not,
have any responsibility or Liability with respect to any Plan established
prior to the Closing Date, and Seller shall be responsible for such
responsibilities and Liabilities. Subject to _Section 3.9_, Purchaser shall
assume and have complete responsibility for all Liabilities associated with
the Purchased Entity Plans identified on _Section 5.14(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and Seller and its Affiliates shall have
no responsibility or Liability with respect to the Purchased Entity Plans.

  



  

Sellers and Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to cause all
liabilities associated with the Business Employees participation in the
Petroleum Geo-Services ASA - 2008 Deferred Bonus Arrangement (the
**_"2008 Bonus Arrangement"_** ) and the Petroleum Geo-Services ASA -
2009 Bonus Plan (the **_"2009 Bonus Plan"_** ) to be transferred to and
assumed by a Purchaser or a Purchased Entity as of the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller retains the sole discretion to pay to
Business Employees and Affiliated Employees the amounts owed pursuant to the
2008 Bonus Arrangement and the 2009 Bonus Plan as of the Closing; _provided_
that if Seller chooses not to exercise such discretion, Seller shall provide
to Buyer, on or before March 1, 2010, a schedule, in a readily-accessible
electronic format, listing for each Business Employee his or her (i) name,
(ii) bonus entitlement under the 2008 Bonus Arrangement, if any, and (iii)
bonus entitlement under the 2009 Bonus Plan, if any.  Purchaser shall pay
such amounts to the listed Business Employees and Affiliated Employees in a
lump-sum cash payment on or before March 15, 2010. If Purchaser or an
Affiliate terminates the employment of a Business Employee for reasons other
than willful misconduct or similar good cause or if his or her employment
terminates due to death or disability prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

payment of amounts owed under the 2008 Bonus Arrangement or the 2009 Bonus
Plan, he or she shall remain entitled to any scheduled payments from
the applicable Purchased Entity under such plans.  If Purchaser or an
Affiliate terminates the employment of a Business Employee for willful
misconduct or similar good cause or he or she voluntarily resigns prior to
the payment of amounts owed under the 2008 Bonus Arrangement, he or she shall
remain entitled to the payment from the applicable Purchased Entity of the
reduced bonus amount as provided under the terms of such plan.

  



  

Sellers and Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to cause all
liabilities associated with the Business Employees participation in the
Petroleum Geo-Services ASA - PGS Retention Bonus Plan 2006-2010 and the
Petroleum Geo-Services ASA - PGS Retention Bonus Plan 2007-2010
(collectively, the **_"Retention Bonus Plans"_** ) to be transferred to and
assumed by a Purchaser or a Purchased Entity as of the Closing. If Purchaser
or an Affiliate terminates the employment of a Business Employee for reasons
other than willful misconduct or similar good cause or if his or her
employment terminates due to death or disability prior to the payment of
amounts owed under the Retention Bonus Plans, he or she shall be paid any
unpaid retention payments owed under the Retention Bonus Plans within 10 days
following such termination.

  



  

(b) All Business Employees employed by the Purchased Entities immediately
prior to the Closing shall remain employed by the Purchased Entities
immediately following the Closing, and shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser and its Affiliates thereafter. _Section 5.14(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of certain employees of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries)
who provide services relating to the Business Owning Entities and who Seller
and such Affiliates shall make available to Purchaser to discuss
potential employment, with any such employment to be contingent upon, and to
begin after, the Closing (such employees being collectively the **_"
Affiliate Employees"_**). _Section 5.14(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be divided into two lists, one containing the Affiliate
Employees who are assigned on a full time or primary basis to any function of
the Purchased Entities (the **_"Dedicated Employees"_** ) and another
containing those Affiliate Employees who provide services to the Business on
less than a full-time basis or on a secondary basis (the **_"Support
Employees"_** ).

  



  

As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Seller
will provide to Purchaser a schedule in a readily-accessible electronic
format listing for each Business Employee and Affiliate Employee his or
her (i) name, employee identification number, job title, and assigned
work location, (ii) dates of employment by Seller or its Affiliates and date
of employment for each of the purposes identified in _Section
5.14(d),_ (iii) base salary or hourly rate of compensation, prior years
actual, and current years targeted, bonus and incentive compensation (if
any), and (iv) whether or not such employee is actively at work and if not,
whether on an approved leave, and for those employees on an approved leave,
the reason for, and the expected duration of, the approved leave. Following
the Effective Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
not to, except in the ordinary course of the Business, alter, promise to
alter, or take any action that would have the effect of altering, with
respect to any Business Employee or Affiliate Employee, any term or aspect of
employment of such Business

  



        
   

  



  

Employee or Affiliate Employee that is required to be disclosed to Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_ or that is the subject of any obligation
of Purchaser under this _Section 5.14_ **** without the prior written consent
of Purchaser. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall update _Section
5.14(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the information provided to
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_ immediately prior to Closing.

  



  

Subject to Sellers timely provision of complete and accurate information as
required by this _Section 5.14_ within twenty (20) days after the Effective
Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) provide
continued employment to each Business Employee employed by the Purchased
Entities, (ii) offer employment (which shall be contingent on the occurrence
of the Closing) to each Dedicated Employee and (iii) may, or may cause its
Affiliates to, at its discretion after interviews, offer employment (which
shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing), to any or all Support
Employees, in each case under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, (A) at a
base salary or hourly rate that is at least equal to such employees then
current base salary or hourly rate as then correctly reflected in the
information provided to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b),_ (B)
with a principal place of employment no greater than forty-nine (49) miles
from the location where such employee is employed as of the Effective Date as
then correctly reflected in the information provided to Purchaser pursuant to
this _Section 5.14(b)_, (C) with benefits that are the same as, or
comparable in the aggregate to, the benefits provided to similarly-situated
employees of Purchaser under the Purchasers Plans, including but not limited
to benefits provided pursuant to Purchasers retirement plans, severance
plans, vacation plans, health, dental and vision insurance and incentive
compensation plans, with such benefits continuing in substantially the same
form for at least one year following Closing, and (D) with restricted stock
or stock unit awards granted as soon as practicable following Closing (which
may be subject to Geokinetics stockholder approval) with vesting terms over a
three-year period and in an amount as determined by the compensation
committee of Geokinetics board of directors equal to the intrinsic value of
the PGS unvested options held by such employee on the Effective Date, valuing
the Geokinetics Common Stock at the Geokinetics Common Stock Price (a
**_"Qualifying Offer"_** ). Each Qualifying Offer shall be consistent with
the provisions of this _Section 5.14_, may contain such other provisions and
terms not inconsistent with this _Section 5.14_ as the Purchaser or its
Affiliates may deem appropriate, and shall remain open for a period of at
least five (5) days.  On or before the date that is five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller as to each Affiliate
Employee who has accepted a Qualifying Offer and each Affiliate Employee who
has not accepted a Qualifying Offer. The employment with Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser of each Affiliate Employee who accepts a Qualifying
Offer and reports to work with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser in a
timely manner and otherwise in accordance with the Qualifying Offer shall be
effective as of the Closing Date and such individuals shall be referred to as
" ** _Transferred Employees_**."

  



  

Purchaser shall retain all liability for severance and other benefits
(including any liability arising under the WARN Act) to any Business Employee
employed by a Purchased Entity who is terminated (whether as a result of
Purchasers decision to terminate such individuals employment or due to
"constructive termination" or similar

  



        
   

  



  

concept under applicable Law) as of or after Closing. Seller shall retain all
liability for severance and other benefits (including liability arising under
the WARN Act) to any Affiliate Employee who does not receive or who receives
but does not accept a Qualifying Offer from Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser shall be responsible for any claims that its decisions to
hire or not hire any particular Affiliate Employee violate applicable Law, or
any claims with respect to the terms and conditions under which Purchaser
offers employment to or employs any Business Employee or Affiliate Employee.

  



  

Subject to Applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that
any employment offered by Purchaser to a Business Employee, Affiliate
Employee or Transferred Employee will be "at will" and may be terminated by
the Purchaser, Business Employee, Affiliate Employee or Transferred Employee
at any time for any reason.

  



  

(c) Subject to Sellers timely provision of complete and accurate information
as required by this _Section 5.14(c)_, Purchaser shall cause each Business
Employee and such Business Employees eligible dependents who are covered as
of the Closing Date by a Plan that is a group health, prescription drug,
dental or vision benefit plan to be offered coverage under group health,
prescription drug, dental or similar type of benefit plan, as the case may
be, maintained by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, under which the
Business Employee and any eligible dependents of the Business Employee shall
be (i) eligible effective immediately upon the inception of their employment
with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, and (ii) credited, for the year
during which such coverage under such plans begin, with any deductibles, out-
of-pocket maximums and co-payments already incurred during such year under
Plans that provide similar benefits (or Purchaser will provide an
economically equivalent benefit). Seller shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to Purchaser within ten Business Days of Purchasers request all
information reasonably requested by Purchaser for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of this _Section 5.14(c)_.

  



  

(d) Subject to Sellers timely provision of complete and accurate information
as required by this _Section 5.14(d)_, Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser
Plans maintained after the Closing by Purchaser to recognize each Business
Employees years of service prior to the Closing Date with Seller for
purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit
determination under such plans and programs, including paid vacation, paid
sick time, severance benefits and employer contribution rates under profit
sharing and retirement plans but not for purposes of benefit accrual under
any Purchaser Plan subject to Section 301 _et seq._ of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. Purchaser shall cause each group health plan sponsored by
Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) under which a Business Employee is
eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date to waive any
preexisting condition exclusions otherwise applicable to such Business
Employee and his eligible dependents to the same extent as waived or
satisfied under Sellers Plan. Seller shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to Purchaser within ten Business Days of Purchasers request all
information reasonably requested by Purchaser for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of this _Section 5.14(d)_.

  



         
 

  



  

(e) Claims of Business Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and
dependents for medical, dental, prescription, drug, life insurance, and/or
other welfare benefits ( ** _"Welfare Benefits"_** ) (other than disability
benefits) that are incurred before the Closing Date shall be the sole
responsibility and Liability of the Sellers Plans except to the extent such
benefits claims are incurred but unpaid under a Purchased Entity Plan in
which case Purchaser and the Purchased Entity Plans shall bear sole
responsibility for such Liability.  For purposes of the preceding provisions
of this paragraph, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred on the
date when the medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies
are provided, and not when the condition arose or when the course of
treatment began. Claims of individuals receiving disability benefits under a
Sellers Plan as of the Closing Date shall be the sole responsibility of the
Sellers Plan pursuant to its terms and conditions except to the extent such
benefits claims are incurred but unpaid under a Purchased Entity Plan in
which case Purchaser and the Purchased Entity Plans shall bear sole
responsibility for such Liability.

  



  

(f) Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities (including Liabilities
for associated administrative functions) for workers compensation claims
made for compensable injuries of Transferred Employees that first occurred
before the Closing Date, except to the extent such Liability arises under a
workers compensation insurance policy that is transferred to a Purchaser
with a Purchased Entity. Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities
(including liabilities for associated administrative functions) for all
workers compensation claims that occurred on or after the inception of
employment of the Transferred Employee by Purchaser or its Affiliates. For
purposes of this _Section 5.14(f)_, a workers compensation claim shall be
"made" at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to eligibility
for workers compensation benefits or at the time the occupational disease
becomes manifest, as applicable, under the respective workers compensation
act governing the alleged injury or disease. Seller will notify
applicable Governmental Authorities, if and as appropriate, of any on-the-job
injuries or workers compensation claims for which they are responsible under
this _Section 5.14(f)_. Purchaser will notify applicable
Governmental Authorities, if and as appropriate, of any on-the-job injuries
or workers compensation claims for which it is responsible under this
_Section 5.14(f)_. Seller and Purchaser will promptly cooperate in providing
to each other such information as is reasonably needed for
these notifications and related filings.

  



  

(g) During the period between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, except
in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise expressly contemplated by
this Agreement or agreed to by Purchasers in writing, the Sellers shall cause
the Purchased Entities to not (i) grant any severance, retention or
termination pay to, or amend any existing severance, retention or termination
arrangement with, any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of any Purchased Entity as of the Effective Date or any former
director, officer employee, independent contractor or consultant of any
Purchased Entity, (ii) increase or accelerate the payment or vesting of,
benefits payable under any existing severance, retention or termination pay
policies or employment agreements, (iii) enter into or amend any
employment, consulting, deferred compensation or other similar agreement with
any Person working in the Business (except as required by applicable Law or
required by the terms of such Plan prior to amendment), (iv) establish,
adopt, amend or terminate, or increase the benefits provided under, any
collective bargaining

  



        
   

  



  

agreement, retention agreement or Plan (except as required by applicable Law
or the terms of such Plan prior to amendment), (v) amend or terminate any
Purchased Entity Plan except to the extent required by Law, or (vi) increase
the compensation, bonus, severance, incentive awards or benefits payable to
any current or former officer, director, employee, independent contractor or
consultant of any Purchased Entity.

  



  

(h) With respect to any Business Employees who become employed by Geokinetics
or a Subsidiary of Geokinetics after the Closing Date, (i) Geokinetics or
such Subsidiary will permit such Business Employees to schedule and take
vacation days that have accrued prior to the Closing Date with pay for the
maximum length of time as permitted under Sellers vacation policy as in
effect on the Closing Date, (ii) Geokinetics or such Subsidiary shall give
service credit for purposes of determining post Closing Date vacation, sick
leave and any other paid time off entitlements that Geokinetics or such
Subsidiary provides to its employees generally and (iii) Geokinetics or such
Subsidiary shall permit each Business Employee to use or receive payment for
all amounts of Accrued Time Off (as defined in the policies of PGS) earned by
such Business Employee prior to the Closing under the policies of Sellers and
their Affiliates. Sellers shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
Purchasers within ten (10) Business Days of a Purchasers request all
information reasonably requested by Purchaser for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of this _Section 5.14(h)_.

  



  

(i) Geokinetics, Sellers and the Purchased Entities shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects relating to any actions to be taken pursuant
to this _Section 5.14_.

  



  

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Section 5.14_ are not intended to and shall not create or confer any
third party beneficiary rights respecting any Business Employee, Affiliate
Employee, Transferred Employee or any other Person.

  



  

(k) To the extent, following Closing, a Seller retains the employment of any
Business Employee or Affiliate Employee who worked primarily for the Business
prior to Closing, such Seller agrees to utilize all commercially reasonable
legal and equitable remedies available to it to enforce any applicable
covenant not to compete and/or non-solicitation agreement in the event such
employee is no longer employed by such Seller or its Affiliate.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.15_** Notice of Certain Events.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly as reasonably practicable
notify the other parties of:

  



  

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or other Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions;

  



  

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions;

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) any Legal Action commenced or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if pending on the Effective Date, would have been required
to have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or that relates to the
consummation of the Transactions;

  



  

(iv) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a default or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received
by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the Effective Date, under any
material agreement (in case of the Sellers, solely with respect to the
Business); and

  



  

(v) any Seller Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect
or the occurrence of any event that would result in a Seller Material Adverse
Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

  



  

(b) If, prior to the Closing, PGS or any Subsidiary of PGS, other than a
Purchased Entity or a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Purchased Entity, conducts
the Business in any jurisdiction in which a Business Owning Entity does not
conduct the Business as of the Effective Date, PGS will promptly notify the
Purchasers of (i) the jurisdiction in which the Business is being conducted,
(ii) the identity of the entity conducting the Business, and (iii) the nature
(including a brief summary) of the Business being conducted, and shall
provide the Purchasers with copies of all Contracts and other documents
related to such Business, _provided_ , that, for this purpose, submitting a
bid for work will not constitute the conduct of Business.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.16_** **_Termination of Inter-company Indebtedness._** At or
prior to the Closing, PGS shall cause each Purchased Entity and each
Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity to terminate, settle or otherwise satisfy
any indebtedness or accounts payable owed by the Purchased Entity or such
Subsidiary to PGS or any Affiliate of PGS. Such termination, settlement or
satisfaction shall be effected by means of causing at least 95% of the total
amount of such indebtedness or accounts payable to be either paid off,
contributed to capital or converted into common or preferred equity of the
respective Purchased Entities and Subsidiaries. For any remaining such
indebtedness or accounts payable, in the event PGS intends to cause such
termination, settlement or satisfaction to be effected by some other means,
it will not do so without obtaining the prior written consent of Geokinetics,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.17_** **_Performance Bonds._** _Section 5.17_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule lists all of the performance, local import, bid or other
bond, letter of credit or other guarantee related primarily to the conduct of
the Business posted by an Asset Seller or any Affiliate of an Asset Seller
(other than a Purchased Entity or a Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity as of
the Effective Date). If any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Purchased Entity or its Subsidiaries) has posted a performance, local import,
bid or other bond, letter of credit or other guarantee related primarily to
the conduct of the Business, the Purchasers and the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other in order (i)
for such Seller or any such Affiliate to obtain the release of any such bond,
letter of credit or guarantee and (ii) to the extent required, for a
Purchaser to obtain a substitute bond, letter of credit or guarantee or to
assume such Sellers or such Affiliates existing bond, letter of credit or
guarantee, in each case

  



        
   

  



  

on or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchasers shall indemnify and
reimburse promptly the Sellers and their Affiliates for all costs and
liabilities incurred by the Sellers or any such Affiliate as a result of the
Sellers or such Affiliates leaving a performance, local import, bid or
other bond, letter of credit or other guarantee in place after the Closing
Date relating to the Business.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.18_** **_Resignation of Directors._** Effective as of the

(or similar governing body) of each Purchased Entity and each Subsidiary of a
Purchased Entity serving immediately prior to the Closing Date to resign as a
director of the Purchased Entity.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.19_** **_Utilities and Assessments; Other Allocations._** In
the case of the Purchased Assets, any charges for utilities or similar costs
or assessments, common area maintenance reimbursements to lessors, local
business or other license fees and other similar periodic charges and all

prorated on a per diem basis through the Closing Date (based on estimates or
the most recent amounts paid), with the Sellers being responsible for all of
such prorated charges attributable to the period on or prior to the Closing
Date and the Purchasers being responsible for all of such prorated charges
attributable to the period after the Closing Date. Promptly upon receipt, the
Purchasers or the Sellers, as appropriate, shall provide the other with
copies of all bills for such items for which the other party is responsible
pursuant to this _Section 5.19_. The resulting amount payable by the
Purchasers or the Sellers shall be paid promptly upon demand by the party
hereto to whom such payment is owed.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.20_** Condition to Transfer of Contracts.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that at the Closing (i) no Asset Seller is
assigning to any Purchaser any Contract or other right that by its terms
requires the consent of any other party unless such consent has been obtained
prior to the Closing and (ii) no Asset Seller is assigning to any Purchaser
any Contract or other right in any jurisdiction where such Purchaser is not
qualified under applicable Law to own or perform such Contract or right. With
respect to each such unassigned Contract or right, after the Closing, the
applicable Asset Seller shall, if requested by the applicable Purchaser,
continue as the prime contracting party and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts (without being required to make any payment or incur any
economic obligation or liability in connection therewith) to obtain the
consent of all required parties to the assignment of such Contract or right,
but such Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefits of such Contract or
right accruing after the Closing to the extent that such Asset Seller is
entitled to such benefits and may provide the Purchaser with such benefits
without violating the terms of such Contract or right, provided, that the
applicable Purchaser agrees to perform and assume, at its sole expense, all
of the obligations of such Asset Seller to be performed under such Contract
or right the benefits of which the applicable Purchaser is receiving after
the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be distributed or transferred out of the
Purchased Entities and their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise settled,
(i) any Excluded Assets or (ii) any assets,

  



        
   

  



  

including Contracts, that are not used primarily in the conduct of
the Business (collectively, the **_"Subject Assets"_** ). If immediately
prior to the Closing Date the Sellers have not received any consent of any
party to a Contract identified in _Section 5.20(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule that is necessary in connection with any such distribution, transfer
or settlement, after the Closing, upon the terms and subject to conditions in
this _Section 5.20_, the Purchasers shall cause the relevant Purchased
Entity or Subsidiary to continue as the prime contracting party under such
Contract and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts (without being
required to make any payment or incur any economic obligation or liability in
connection therewith) to obtain the consent of all required parties to the
assignment of such Contract. If all required consents are obtained after the
Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause the relevant Purchased Entity
or Subsidiary to assign such Contract and all other Subject Assets relating
to such Contract to the Seller designated by PGS promptly following the
receipt of all such required consents, without the payment of any additional
consideration therefor, other than as provided in this _Section 5.20_. If
any Subject Assets are not distributed or transferred out of the Purchased
Entities and their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise settled, prior to
the Closing, Geokinetics, the Purchased Entity or Subsidiary holding any such
Subject Assets and the Sellers designated by PGS shall enter into an
agreement on the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to PGS, Geokinetics and the Purchased Entity or Subsidiary, with respect to
the relevant Contract and the related Subject Assets to the effect that such
Purchased Entity or Subsidiary shall continue to perform its obligations
thereunder at the Sellers sole expense and each Seller or other Affiliate of
PGS shall provide, at the sole expense of such Seller or Affiliate, the
personnel, equipment, Intellectual Property or other assets necessary or
desirable for such purpose and such assistance as such Purchased Entity may
require for such purpose, including, without limitation, the use of assets,
software and Intellectual Property (by license, lease or otherwise) of such
Seller or Affiliate (to the extent such Purchased Entity does not have such
use already) of the type and quantity that such Purchased Entity would have
used to perform such Contract had the Transactions not been consummated. Such
agreement shall also provide that, in consideration of the provision of such
personnel and assistance, and to the extent it will not violate or breach the
terms of the Contract, such Purchased Entity shall, promptly after payment of
any amounts to such Purchased Entity or the Purchasers by the other party to
such Contract, pay such amounts to the particular Sellers after subtracting
therefrom the costs, expenses, Taxes and Liabilities incurred by such
Purchased Entity as a result of its continuing to hold, or its performance,
of such Contract so that such Sellers receive the same benefits arising under
such Contract as the relevant Purchased Entity or Subsidiary provided the
Sellers and their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Within a reasonable period of time after the Effective Date, Sellers
shall provide Purchasers with a copy of the Contract described in _Section
5.20(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which copy may be redacted to
exclude confidential, proprietary or competitive information. The Sellers
shall keep the Purchasers reasonably informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of distributions, transfers and settlements
described in _Section 5.20(b)_ and shall give the Purchasers prompt notice
of any material adverse change with respect to the ability of the Sellers to
consummate any such distribution, transfer or settlement prior to the Closing
Date.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) The agreement contemplated by _Section 5.20(b)_ shall contain
appropriate mutual indemnification provisions and shall provide that the
Purchased Entity holding the Subject Assets shall not be liable, except for
gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional breach.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.21_** **_Mail Received After Closing._** Following the
Closing, the Purchasers may receive and open all mail addressed to the
Business Owning Entities and, to the extent that such mail and the contents
thereof relate to the Business or the Purchased Assets, deal with the
contents thereof in their discretion. The Purchasers shall notify the
applicable Seller of (and provide such Seller copies of) any mail that on its
face obliges such Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.22_** **_Refunds and Remittances._** After the Closing, if
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates receive any refund or other
amount that is a Purchased Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to a
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Sellers promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted,
such amount to the applicable Purchaser. After the Closing, if the Purchasers
or any of their respective Affiliates receive any refund or other amount that
is a Subject Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to a Seller or any
of its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to
_Section 5.20(b)_ the Purchasers promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be
remitted, such amount to the applicable Seller. After the Closing, if the
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates receive any refund or other
amount that is related to claims (including workers compensation),
litigation, insurance or other matters for which any of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates is responsible hereunder, and which amount is not a
Purchased Asset, or is otherwise properly due and owing to any of the Sellers
or their respective Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Purchasers promptly shall remit, or cause to be remitted, such
amount to the Sellers. After the Closing, if the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates receive any refund or other amount that is related to
claims (including workers compensation), litigation, insurance or other
matters for which any of the Purchasers or their respective Affiliates is
responsible hereunder, and which amount is not a Subject Asset, or is
otherwise properly due and owing to any of the Purchasers or their respective
Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Sellers
promptly shall remit, or cause to be remitted, such amount to the Purchasers.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties to this Agreement agree
that this _Section 5.22_ shall not cover or apply to any refunds related to
Taxes, which are covered exclusively by the provisions set forth in _Section
10.7_.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.23_** **_Use of Name; Removal of Name from Signage._** Each
of the Purchasers acknowledges and agrees that the name "Petroleum Geo-
Services" shall not be deemed a Purchased Asset and that the Sellers shall be
permitted (but shall not be required), on or prior to the Closing, to cause
each Purchased Entity to change its name such that the name "Petroleum Geo-
Services" and any abbreviation or derivation thereof is not used in any such
entitys name. Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Purchasers
shall (i) cause any Purchased Entity the name of which includes the name
"Petroleum Geo-Services" and any abbreviation or derivation thereof to change
its name to exclude the name "Petroleum Geo-Services" or any such
abbreviation or derivation thereof, (ii) remove from any and all Purchased
Assets or assets of Purchased Entities that carry the name "Petroleum Geo-
Services" or any abbreviation or derivation thereof or any logos
related thereto or signage used in the Business the name

  



        
   

  



  

"Petroleum Geo-Services," any abbreviation or derivation thereof and any
logos related thereto and (ii) dispose of any marketing or other materials
used in the Business that use the name "Petroleum Geo-Services," any
abbreviation or derivation thereof and any logos related thereto.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.24_** Supplies; Email Addresses.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) At any time after 45 days after the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall
not use, and shall not permit their employees or controlled Affiliates to
use, stationery, purchase order forms, labels, material safety data sheets,
business cards or other similar paper goods or supplies that state or
otherwise indicate thereon that the Business is a division or unit of PGS.

  



  

(b) Within 45 days following the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause
each of their employees, and any employees of any Affiliates of a Purchaser,
to cease to use any email address, email signature or similar electronic
media or information that includes the name "Petroleum Geo-Services" or any
abbreviation or derivation thereof or that otherwise indicates that such
individual may be an employee of PGS or one of its Affiliates.

  



  

 ** _Section 5.25_** **_Powers of Attorney._** At the Closing, the Sellers
will deliver to the Purchasers a true, accurate, and complete list of the
Persons holding any powers of attorney from any Purchased Entity or
Subsidiary of a Purchased Entity as of the Closing Date (excluding any powers
of attorney solely covering the authority to perform ministerial or clerical

 ** _Section 5.26_** Financing of the Transaction.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on or prior to
the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) immediately above,
Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Bridge Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii) enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummate the Bridge Financing at or prior to
Closing, _provided_  that Geokinetics obligations to arrange and consummate
the Bridge Financing shall be suspended and the Bridge Commitment may

  



        
   

  



  

terminate, upon consummation by Geokinetics of the Financing. Geokinetics
shall not create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien (including any escrow
arrangement) on any proceeds from the Financing that would materially delay
or prevent consummation of the Transactions. Without limiting the generality
of the preceding sentence, if any such proceeds are subject to an escrow
arrangement, Geokinetics shall cause such arrangement to be on commercially
reasonable terms and otherwise to provide that (i) such arrangement shall not
be terminated, nor the funds subject thereto be returned to the applicable
investors or other Persons, prior to the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) prior to such termination of
the escrow arrangement, a portion of such funds in an amount sufficient to
pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Purchase Price shall not be used
for any purpose other than to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the
Purchase Price.  Geokinetics will furnish correct and complete copies of all
definitive agreements relating to the Financing (including any escrow
agreement) to the Sellers promptly upon their execution.

  



  

(c) Geokinetics shall keep the Sellers informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Financing, including activity
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, and shall give the Sellers prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to the Financing.
 Without limiting the foregoing, Geokinetics agrees to notify the
Sellers promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any
time (i) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated, rescinded
or withdrawn for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to
the Commitment Letter notifies Geokinetics that such source no longer intends
to provide financing to Geokinetics on the terms set forth therein, or (iii)
for any reason Geokinetics no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms set forth in
the Commitment Letter.  Geokinetics shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which
consent may be granted or withheld in the Sellers sole discretion), take or
fail to take any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger,
acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity
financing, that breaches any representation or warranty contained in the
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement entered into in connection with
the Financing, unless waived, or that prevents consummation of the Financing
or delays the consummation of the Financing past the Termination Date,
including the Bridge Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.
Geokinetics shall not (x) amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the
Commitment Letter or (y) waive, or agree to waive, any provision in the
Commitment Letter, in each case in any manner that would prevent or
materially impair the consummation of Transactions, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers (which consent may be granted or withheld in the
Sellers sole discretion).

  



  

(d) If any portion of the Bridge Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letter
shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Geokinetics
for any reason other than completion of a Financing other than the Bridge
Financing, or if, after completion of a Financing other than the Bridge
Financing, Geokinetics no longer has immediately available funds (including
funds held in escrow pursuant to an arrangement satisfying the requirements
of _Section 5.26(b)_) on or before the Closing Date in an

  



        
   

  



  

amount exceeding the amount required to provide for all obligations of the
Purchasers under this Agreement to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the
Purchase Price, Geokinetics shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount equal
to the amount required by the Financing ( ** _"Alternate Financing"_** ) and
to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Sellers with a copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing
as the Commitment Letter as originally issued and on terms and conditions
(including termination rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to
Geokinetics than those included in the Commitment Letter (the **_"New
Commitment Letter"_** ). To the extent applicable, Geokinetics shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions
described in any New Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions
set forth in the New Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the New
Commitment Letter; (iii) enforce its rights under the New Commitment Letter;
and (iv) consummate the Alternate Financing at or prior to the Closing.
Geokinetics will furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive
documents to the Sellers promptly upon their execution. In the
event Alternate Financing is obtained and a New Commitment Letter is entered
into, references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter shall be deemed
to refer to the New Commitment Letter, as applicable.

  



  

(e) The Sellers agree to provide, and prior to the Closing Date will cause
the Purchased Entities and each of their respective officers and employees to
provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and
consummation of, and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, the
Financing (and any substitutions or replacements thereof).  In furtherance
of and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Sellers shall (i) cause the
senior officers of the Business to be reasonably available, on reasonable
advance notice, to Geokinetics and the financial institutions providing the
Financing to participate in due diligence sessions and to participate in
presentations (including any "road shows" or similar presentations) related
with the Financing, (ii) assist in the preparation of one or more appropriate
and customary offering documents and assisting Geokinetics and the financial
institutions providing the Financing in preparing other appropriate and
customary marketing materials, in each case to be used in connection with the
Financing, and (iii) request the independent auditors with respect to the
Business to prepare and deliver "comfort letters," dated the date of each
offering document used in connection with any transaction in connection with
the Financing (with appropriate bring down comfort letters delivered on the
closing date of the Financing), in compliance with professional standards and
otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable to Geokinetics, as the case may be,
in each of the foregoing cases as may be necessary and customary in
connection with a financing substantially similar to the Capital Markets
Financings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall be reimbursed
promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days of providing invoices to
Geokinetics) by Geokinetics for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Sellers in connection with the foregoing. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.26_ shall require (i) the Sellers or any senior officers of the Business
to engage in any action that would

  



        
   

  



  

interfere unreasonably with the business of the Sellers and
their Subsidiaries or the Business or (ii) the Sellers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur
any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing.
Geokinetics shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors and other representatives from
and against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement and completion of the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith except with respect to
information in respect of the Business supplied by the Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries and representatives specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.

  



  

(f) PGS shall ensure that the Supplied Information, as of the respective date
of such Geokinetics Offering Document, will not contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements in such Supplied Information, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that
such Supplied Information is included in such Geokinetics Offering Document
in conformity with the Supplied Information as provided by PGS. Geokinetics
shall ensure that each Geokinetics Offering Document, as of the respective
date of such Geokinetics Offering Document, will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(g) If requested by Purchasers, PGS will use its commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to prepare, in accordance with GAAP, financial statements of the
Business as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the **_"PGS 2009
Audited Financial Statements"_** ) and (ii) to cause KPMG to audit the PGS
2009 Audited Financial Statements in a manner consistent with the audit of
the Business Financial Statements; _provided_ , that Geokinetics shall pay
all incremental costs and expenses of such audit (or a good faith estimate
thereof), or shall reimburse PGS for such incremental costs and expenses (or
estimate thereof), over the amount that PGS would have otherwise incurred by
reason of the review of the accounts of the Business in having PGSs 2009
consolidated financial statements audited under IFRS. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the preceding sentence, PGS shall not be required to
prepare, or cause to be prepared, the PGS 2009 Audited Financial Statements
until such time as the IFRS audit of PGSs consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 has been completed.

 ** _Section 7.4 Intentionally Omitted._**

  



  

 ** _Section 7.5 Indemnification Procedures._**

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) If (i) a party entitled to indemnity pursuant to _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_
(an **_"Indemnitee"_** ) believes in good faith that it has suffered or
incurred a Loss that is subject to indemnification under this _Article VII_
or elsewhere under this Agreement, or (ii) a claim (an **_" Indemnity
Claim"_**) is asserted against an Indemnitee, then in each case the
Indemnitee shall give the party that the Indemnitee reasonably believes owes
an obligation of indemnity under this _Article VII_ or elsewhere under this
Agreement (such party, the **_" Indemnitor"_**) written notice of the
underlying claim setting forth the particulars associated with the underlying
claim (including a copy of the written underlying claim, if any) as then
known by the Indemnitee ( ** _" Indemnity Claim Notice"_**). The Indemnitee
shall, to the extent practicable, give an Indemnity Claim Notice within such
time as will allow the Indemnitor a reasonable period in which to evaluate
and timely respond to the underlying claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
failure to do so shall not affect an Indemnitees rights hereunder except
for, and only to the extent of, any incremental increase in the cost of the
Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to give notice; and (b) the
foregoing shall not extend the time period set forth in _Sections 7.8_ or
_7.9_ (as applicable to the claim), but if an Indemnity Claim Notice is given
to an Indemnitor within the applicable time period (if any) with respect to
such claim set forth in _Article VII_, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be
effective, subject to the other limitations in _Section 7.3_
(if applicable), as to costs and expenses incurred or suffered after the
expiration of any such time period, with respect to the matter described in
such Indemnity Claim Notice.

  



  

(b) Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice involving a claim by a Third
Party (a **_" Third Party Claim"_**) for which an Indemnitor believes it may
have an obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall,
if it so elects in accordance with this _Section 7.5_ (without prejudice
to its right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement),
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the
Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with such defense. If any Third Party Claim involves a fact pattern wherein
each party may have an obligation to indemnify the other party, each party
may assume the defense of and hire counsel for that portion of the Third
Party Claim for which it may have an obligation of indemnity. In all
instances, the Indemnitee may employ separate counsel and participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Indemnitor
has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
7.5_, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall be
borne solely by the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor elects by written notice
to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then (i) the

  



        
   

  



  

Indemnitor shall defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim, (ii)
the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim that requires any
action of the Indemnitee other than the payment of money (the payment
of which is assume by Indemnitor) without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (it being acknowledged and agreed that any such judgment
or settlement may be rejected by the Indemnitee in its sole discretion if
such judgment or settlement (1) does not fully release the Indemnitee as
part of such judgment or settlement, or (2) imposes any obligation
or restriction upon the Indemnitee, other than the payment of obligations

(a) The Sellers shall jointly and severally **** indemnify the Purchasers
from, against and in respect of (A) any Taxes that are imposed on or with
respect to the Purchased Assets or any Purchased Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries and are payable after the Closing Date with respect to
any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, Income Taxes attributable to the sales
of Purchased Assets and Purchased Securities described in this Agreement,
any Taxes for which any

  



        
   

  



  

Purchased Entity or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be or become severally
liable under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or 1.1502-78(b)(2) (or any similar
provision under any applicable foreign, state or local Law) by reason of its
having been a member of the PGS Group or any other affiliated, combined,
consolidated or unitary group or other Tax grouping (other than such a group
or grouping that includes the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates) on or
before the Closing Date, and any Mexican Income Taxes that are imposed on PGS
Mexicana S.A. de C.V. that are payable after the Closing Date with respect to
any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing
Date as a result of certain damages payments made by PGS Mexicana S.A. de
C.V. that are currently under dispute with the Mexican Tax Authority or items
that are similar to such payments, and excluding (i) any Taxes arising from
an event that is not in the ordinary course of business and that occurs on
the Closing Date but after the Closing as a result of any action taken by
the Purchasers or their Affiliates and (ii) any Taxes that are taken
into account in determining Current Liabilities, (B) any Transfer Taxes
for which Sellers are liable under _Section 10.4_ of this Agreement and (C)
any breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.7_ ****
or any breach or violation of any provision in this _Article X_.

  



  

(b) The Purchasers shall jointly and severally **** indemnify the Sellers
from, against and in respect of (A) any Taxes that are imposed on or with
respect to the Purchased Assets or any Purchased Entity or any
Subsidiary thereof with respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning after the Closing Date, (B) any Taxes arising from an event that is
not in the ordinary course of business and that occurs on the Closing Date
but after the Closing as a result of any action taken by the Purchasers or
their Affiliates, (C) any Taxes that are actually paid by the Sellers or
their Affiliates (other than the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries)
that are taken into account in determining Current Liabilities, (D) any
Transfer Taxes for which the Purchasers are liable under _Section 10.4_ and
(E) any breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Section 4.15_
or any breach or violation of any provision in this _Article X_.

  



  

(c) To the extent permitted by Law, the taxable periods of the Business
Owning Entities shall end at the close of business on the Closing Date.
 Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of
the Business Owning Entities for a portion of a taxable year or period that
begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the
Taxes for the portion of the taxable year or period ending on, and the
portion of the taxable year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall
be determined by an interim closing of the books by assuming that the taxable
year or period ended at the close of business on the Closing Date,
except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days in the
annual period elapsed through the Closing Date as compared to the number of
days in the annual period elapsing after the Closing Date.  With regard to
ad valorem, property or similar Taxes, the total amount of such Taxes
allocable to the Sellers shall be the product of (i) such Tax for the
entirety of the Tax period including the Closing Date, multiplied by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Tax period
prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Tax period, and the balance of such Taxes shall be allocated to
Purchasers.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of the Texas franchise tax or
any other Tax that is (i) paid for the privilege of doing business during a
period (a **_"privilege period"_** ) and (ii) computed based on business
activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior to the privilege
period (including, for Texas franchise tax purposes, the accounting periods
prescribed by Texas Tax Code Section 171.1532), any reference to a "taxable
period," "taxable year" or "annual period" shall mean such accounting period
and not the privilege period.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.2 Tax Returns._**

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Petroleum Geo-Services, Inc. shall cause to be included in the
consolidated federal income Tax Returns (and the state income Tax Returns of
any state that permits consolidated, combined, unitary or similar income Tax
Returns, if any) of the PGS Group all Tax Items of PGS Onshore, Inc. through
the Closing Date that are required to be included therein and shall cause
such Tax Returns to be properly filed on or before the Due Date and shall
timely and properly pay any Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns. For
purposes of such Tax Returns, the Tax Items of PGS Onshore, Inc. will, to the
extent permitted by Law, be allocated to the period up to and including the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of
PGS Onshore, Inc. as of the end of the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) The Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and properly file or
cause to be properly filed when due all Tax Returns with respect to the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries, other than the Tax Returns
described in _Section 10.2(a) _and Tax Returns of PGS Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.
and PGS Administracion y Servicios S.A. de C.V., that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date for the 2009 calendar year, and shall timely and
properly pay any Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns.

  



  

(c) The Purchasers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and properly file
or cause to be properly filed when due all Tax Returns with respect to the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries, other than the Tax Returns
described in _Section 10.2(a)_ and _Section 10.2(b),_ that are required to
be filed after the Closing Date and shall timely and properly pay any Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns.

  



  

(d) Except as required by Law, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser Tax Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), all Tax Returns that are prepared by the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 10.2(b)_, and the portion of any Tax Return described in _Section
10.2(a)_ relating exclusively to PGS Onshore, Inc. (a **_"Separate Company
Tax Return"_** ), shall be prepared on a basis consistent with prior periods
and none of the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries shall make or change
any election, adopt or change an annual accounting period, change
any accounting method, or file any amended Tax Return if such change or
amendment would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the
Purchased Entities for any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning
after the Closing Date.

  



     

      
 

  



  

(e) The Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate with each other and shall make
available all necessary records and timely take all action necessary to allow
each party to prepare and file any Tax Return described in this _Section
10.2_.

  



  

(f) If any of the Purchasers or the Sellers may be liable for any portion of
the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed by the other,
the Tax Representative of the party responsible under this Agreement for
filing such Tax Return (the **_"Preparer"_** ) shall prepare and deliver to
the Tax Representative of the other party (the **_"Payor"_** ) not later than
14 days before the Due Date a draft of such Tax Return (or, in the case of a
Tax Return described in _Section 10.2(a)_, the Separate Company Tax Return),
any schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are
relevant to the preparation of the portion of such Tax Return or Separate
Company Tax Return for which the Payor is or may be liable under this
Agreement and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of
Taxes proposed to be payable with respect to such Tax Return or Separate
Company Tax Return for which the Payor is liable under this Agreement. The
Payor shall, prior to the filing of the Tax Return, have the opportunity to
review and consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) at any
time not later than 5 Business Days after receipt of such draft and statement
with respect to Tax Items for which the Payor may be liable under this
Agreement (the **_"Payor Portion"_** ). In the event that the Payor does not
consent to the treatment of the Payor Portion, the Tax Representatives shall
work together, each acting in good faith, to agree on the treatment of such
Payor Portion. Not later than 30 days after filing, the Purchasers shall
provide the Seller Tax Representative with copies of all Tax Returns filed,
or caused to be filed, by the Purchasers with respect to the Purchased
Entities for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, for
Straddle Periods and for the 2009 calendar year Tax Returns of PGS Mexicana,
S.A. de C.V. and PGS Administracion y Servicios, S.A. de C.V., and the
Sellers shall provide the Purchaser Tax Representative with copies of
any Separate Company Tax Return and of all Tax Returns filed, or caused to
be filed, after the Closing Date by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.2(b)_. The Payor shall pay to the Preparer the amount of the Taxes with
respect to any such Tax Return or Separate Company Tax Return for which the
Payor is liable on or before the date one day before the Due Date for such
Taxes (provided that the Preparer has provided written notification to the
Payor of such Due Date).

  



  

(g) The Seller Tax Representative shall provide to the Purchaser Tax
Representative within 90 days after the Closing Date copies of Tax Returns
and all books and records with respect to Taxes of the Purchased Entities and
their Subsidiaries that are in the possession of PGS or an Affiliate of PGS,
but are not in the possession of the Purchased Entities or their
Subsidiaries, as of the Closing Date.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.3_** **_Contest Provisions._** The Purchasers, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand (the **_"Recipient"_** ), shall
notify the Tax Representative of the other party in writing not later than
the earlier of (i) 30 days after receipt by the Recipient or an Affiliate
thereof of written notice (a **_"Proceeding Notice"_** ) of any pending or
threatened audits, adjustments, assessments or other proceedings (a **_"Tax
Audit"_** ) that may affect the liability for Taxes of such other party or
(ii) 15 days prior to the deadline for responding to the Proceeding Notice.
If the Recipient fails to give such notice to the Tax Representative of the
other party, it shall not be

  



        
   

  



  

entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax
Audit to the extent such failure to give notice adversely affects the other
partys right to participate in the Tax Audit or otherwise prejudices the
other party. If, as a result of a "Determination" (as defined in Section
1313 of the Code), a party to this Agreement is entitled to indemnification
for any Taxes arising in connection with a Tax Audit, the party responsible
for such indemnification shall pay the amount of such Taxes due to the Tax
Representative of the party entitled to indemnification no later than 15 days
after the date the payment of such additional Taxes is made, _provided_ the
Tax Representative of the party responsible for such indemnification has
received a written request for such payment setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount of the requested payment. If such Tax Audit relates to any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (and including the
2009 calendar year if the Closing occurs in 2009), the Sellers shall, at
their expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. If such
Tax Audit relates to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (but
excluding the 2009 calendar year if the Closing occurs in 2009), the
Purchasers shall, at their expense, control the defense and settlement of
such Tax Audit.  The Tax Representative of the party in control of the
defense or settlement of any Tax Audit that relates to Taxes for which the
other party may be liable under this Agreement shall keep the Tax
Representative of the other party informed of the progress of such Tax Audit.
The parties shall cooperate with each other and with their respective
Affiliates in the negotiation and settlement of any Tax Audit described in
this _Section 10.3_. The Sellers shall provide or cause to be provided to
the Purchaser Tax Representative necessary authorizations, including powers
of attorney, to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Audit that the
Purchasers are entitled to control pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ and shall
execute or cause to be executed any documents necessary for the Sellers to
defend or settle any such Tax Audit. Likewise the Purchasers shall provide
or cause to be provided to the Seller Tax Representative necessary
authorizations, including powers of attorney, to control the defense or
settlement of any Tax Audit that the Sellers are entitled to control pursuant
to this _Section 10.3_ and shall execute or cause to be executed any
documents necessary for the Sellers to defend or settle any such Tax Audit.
For any Tax Audit where both Sellers and Purchasers are liable for Taxes
under this Agreement, such Tax Audit shall not be finally settled without the
prior written consent of the non-controlling party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.4_** **_Transfer Taxes._** Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50
percent by the Sellers and 50 percent by the Purchasers.  Notwithstanding
_Section 10.2_ of this Agreement, which shall not apply to Tax Returns
relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection
with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party
primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for
filing such Tax Returns, and such party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the Tax Representative of the other
party at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax Returns. Purchasers
and Sellers further agree to use (and to cause their Affiliates to use) their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Transfer Taxes, _provided_  such efforts will not adversely
affect the party to whom the request is made.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.5 Value Added Taxes_**

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Any VAT payable with respect to the Transactions shall, as between the
Sellers and Purchasers, be payable by the Purchasers.  The Purchaser shall,
within 10 days of a

  



        
   

  



  

written demand being made by Seller (such demand being accompanied by a valid
VAT tax invoice issued by Seller to Purchaser and reasonable evidence of
Sellers liability to account for such VAT), pay to Seller the amount of VAT
payable in respect of such Transaction. If the relevant Tax Authorities
subsequently determine that a supply should have been exempt, subject to a
reduced rate of VAT or zero-rated for VAT purposes, either as the supply of a
going concern or pursuant to Article 56 of the European Union Directive on
VAT, or pursuant to any other applicable Law, Seller shall repay to Purchaser
the amount of any VAT previously paid by Purchaser.

  



  

(b) If Purchaser reasonably determines that any portion of the Transactions
meets the requirements for VAT exemption or zero-rating for VAT purposes as
the supply of a going concern, or pursuant to Article 56 of the European
Union Directive on VAT, or pursuant to any other applicable Law, then the
provisions of Section 1.2(a) shall not apply and instead Sellers agree that
the Transactions are exempt or zero-rated (as applicable) for VAT purposes.
 If it later is determined by any Taxing Authority that any portion of the
Transactions are subject to VAT, the VAT will, as between the relevant Seller
and Purchasers, be payable by the Purchaser, and Purchaser shall, immediately
upon written demand made by Seller (such demand being accompanied by a valid
VAT tax invoice issued by relevant Seller to Purchaser reasonable evidence of
Sellers liability to account for such VAT), pay or cause the relevant
Purchaser to pay to Seller the amount of VAT payable in respect of that
portion of the Transaction.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.6_** **_Tax Sharing Agreements and Arrangements._** All
Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation agreements or other similar agreements
or arrangements relating to the allocation or responsibility for Taxes
between or among any of the Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries,
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall be terminated with respect to
any of the Purchased Entities and any of their Subsidiaries prior to Closing,
and all obligations of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries
thereunder shall be released in full so that as of Closing none of the
Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries shall have any liability
under any such agreement or arrangement.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.7_** **_Section 338 Elections._** Purchasers or their
Affiliates will not make an election under Section 338 of the Code for PGS
Onshore, Inc. or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of
Sellers. Should the Purchasers or their Affiliates make any election under
Section 338 of the Code for any other of the Purchased Entities or their
Subsidiaries, written notice will be provided to the Seller Tax
Representative.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.8_** **_Tax Refunds._** The Purchasers agree to pay to the
Seller Tax Representative any refund received (whether by payment, credit,
offset or otherwise) by the Purchasers or their Affiliates in respect of any
Taxes for which any Seller is liable hereunder, other than Taxes that are
taken into account in determining Current Assets (whether such Taxes were
paid before or after the Closing), within 30 days after such refund is
received. The parties (and their Affiliates) shall cooperate in order to take
any necessary steps to claim any such refund provided that the out-of-pocket
costs of obtaining such a refund shall be borne by the Sellers.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Section 10.9 Additional Tax Indemnifications._**

  

 ** _ _**

  

In the event the liability of a non-U.S. Business Owning Entity for Taxes for
which the Sellers are liable under _Section 10.1(a)_ is increased and the
particular Tax Item that produced such increase results, directly or
indirectly, in a reduction in the liability of the Purchased Entities or
their Affiliates for Taxes (a **_"Purchaser Tax Benefit"_** ), the Purchasers
shall be liable for and shall pay to the Seller Tax Representative the amount
of such Purchaser Tax Benefit, _provided_ that such amount shall not exceed
the amount of the additional Taxes payable by the Sellers or their Affiliates
resulting from such Tax Item (a **_"Seller Tax Detriment"_** ). Such payment
shall be made within 30 days of the Due Date of the Tax Return for the
taxable period during which the Purchaser Tax Benefit was recognized. In no
event shall the Purchaser or its Affiliates have an obligation to pay
the Seller or its Affiliates until such time as any Purchaser Tax Benefit
is actually recognized by use of the particular Tax Item giving rise to
the Purchaser Tax Benefit on a Tax Return.  In the event of the later
adjustment, in whole or in part, of any Tax Item that produced the Purchaser
Tax Benefit or the Seller Tax Detriment, the Seller Tax Representative shall
refund to the Purchaser Tax Representative any amount previously paid under
this _Section 10.9_ that is determined not to be owing as a result of such
adjustment, or the Purchaser Tax Representative shall further remit to the
Seller Tax Representative the amount of any increase in the amount required
to be paid under this _Section 10.9_ as a result of such adjustment. The
Tax Representatives shall promptly notify each other of any Purchaser Tax
Benefit and Seller Tax Detriment and provide details supporting the
calculation of the amount of such Purchaser Tax Benefit or Seller Tax
Detriment. The amount of any Purchaser Tax Benefit or Seller Tax Detriment
shall be determined by comparing the Taxes payable without the adjustment in
question with the Taxes payable after taking into account such adjustment.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.10_** **_Assistance and Cooperation._** The parties agree
that, after the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) Each party shall cooperate fully in assisting (and causing their
respective Affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns
that such other party is responsible for preparing and filing;

  



  

(b) The parties shall cooperate fully (and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate fully) in preparing for any Tax Audits, or disputes with Tax
Authorities, relating to any Tax Returns or Taxes on or with respect to the
Purchased Assets or any of the Purchased Entities, including providing access
to relevant books and records relating to Taxes at issue;

  



  

(c) The parties shall make available (and cause their respective Affiliates
to make available) to each other as reasonably requested all relevant books
and records relating to Taxes;

  



  

(d) Each party shall promptly furnish the Tax Representative of the other
party with copies of all relevant correspondence received by such party or
its Affiliates from any Tax Authority in connection with any liability for
Taxes for which such other party may have an indemnification obligation under
this Agreement;

  



  

(e) The Purchasers will retain (and will cause the Purchased Entities to
retain) copies of all Tax Returns and books and records with respect to Taxes
for which the Sellers may

  



        
   

  



  

have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods to
which such obligation may relate, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority with respect thereto; and

  



  

(f) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the party requesting
assistance or cooperation shall bear the other partys (or its Affiliates)
out-of-pocket expenses in complying with such request to the extent that
those expenses are attributable to fees and other costs of unaffiliated
third-party service providers.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.11 Survival._** The provisions of this _Article X_ shall
survive until such time as the statute of limitations runs for the Tax matter
to which the relevant provision applies.

  



  

 ** _Section 10.12_** **_Conflict._** In the event of a conflict between
the provisions of this _Article X_ and any other provision of
this Agreement, the provisions of this _Article X_ shall control. The
provisions of _Article VII_ shall not apply to any Taxes or any
indemnification claims relating to Taxes.

and void.

 ** _ _**

  

(a) Each Seller, by its execution of this Agreement, hereby irrevocably
authorizes PGS to provide all notices on behalf of such Seller, to make all
decisions that are to be made by the Sellers under this Agreement, to
exercise or waive any rights of such Seller under this Agreement and to take
all other actions to be taken by the Sellers under this Agreement. Any
action or inaction of PGS under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be

  



        
   

  



  

binding upon all the Sellers as if performed by all the Sellers, and, thus,
whenever the "Sellers" are authorized, empowered or directed to exercise any
right, take any action or inaction or make any decision or
determination under or pursuant to this Agreement, such may be taken and
accomplished only by PGS (and not by the Sellers) and shall not require the
consent or approval of the Sellers. The Purchasers shall have the right to
deal exclusively with PGS, as the representative of the Sellers, with respect
to all matters arising under or relating to this Agreement. The Purchasers may
rely upon any action taken by PGS on behalf of the Sellers under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PGS may (a)
receive or give all written notices, instructions and other communications
hereunder and (b) grant waivers and consents to the Purchasers in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions. PGS shall have no liability to the
Sellers for decisions made by it or actions taken by it on behalf of the
Sellers as permitted pursuant to this _Section 11.11(a)_ unless
such decision or action is due to the gross negligence or intentional
misconduct of PGS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
11.11(a)_ shall relieve any Seller from any obligation it may have under this
Agreement, and each Seller shall be required to take each affirmative action
as to which such Seller has an obligation hereunder (including, without
limitation, the obligation to execute and deliver to the Purchasers the
documents to be delivered to the Purchasers at Closing in accordance with
_Section 6.5(a)_ and the other provisions of this Agreement).

  



  

(b) Each Purchaser, by its execution of this Agreement, hereby irrevocably
authorizes Geokinetics to provide all notices on behalf of such Purchaser, to
make all decisions that are to be made by the Purchasers under this
Agreement, to exercise or waive any rights of such Purchaser under this
Agreement and to take all other actions to be taken by the Purchasers under
this Agreement. Any action or inaction of Geokinetics under or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be binding upon all the Purchasers as if performed by
all the Purchasers, and, thus, whenever the "Purchasers" are authorized,
empowered or directed to exercise any right, take any action or inaction or
make any decision or determination under or pursuant to this Agreement, such
may be taken and accomplished only by Geokinetics (and not by the Purchasers)
and shall not require the consent or approval of the Purchasers. The Sellers
shall have the right to deal exclusively with Geokinetics, as the
representative of the Purchasers, with respect to all matters arising under
or relating to this Agreement. The Sellers may rely upon any action taken by
Geokinetics on behalf of the Purchasers under this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Geokinetics may (a) receive or give all
written notices, instructions and other communications hereunder and (b)
grant waivers and consents to the Sellers in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions. Geokinetics shall have no liability to the Purchasers
for decisions made by it or actions taken by it on behalf of the Purchasers
as permitted pursuant to this _Section 11.11(b)_ unless such decision or
action is due to the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of
Geokinetics. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
11.11(b)_ shall relieve any Purchaser from any obligation it may have under
this Agreement, and each Purchaser shall be required to take each affirmative
action as to which such Purchaser has an obligation hereunder (including,
without limitation, the obligation to execute and deliver to the Sellers the
documents to be delivered to the Sellers at Closing in accordance with
_Section 6.5(b)_ and the other provisions of this Agreement).

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Section 11.12_** **_Disclosure Schedules._** The disclosures made on any
disclosure schedule, including the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, with respect to any representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made with respect to any other representation or
warranty requiring the same or similar disclosure to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to other representations and warranties is
reasonably evident from the face of the disclosure schedule. The inclusion
of any matter on any disclosure schedule will not be deemed an admission by
any party that such listed matter is material or that such listed matter has
or would have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.13_** **_Extensions, Waivers, Etc._** At any time prior to
the Closing Date, Purchasers and Sellers may:

  



  

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party; or

  



  

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Purchaser or any
Seller in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.14_** **_Specific Performance._** The parties to this
Agreement agree that, if the obligations to pay the Purchase Price or to
consummate the Transactions or other covenants or agreements in this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of such terms of this Agreement and
immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity;  _provided_ , _however_ , that from and
after Closing, this _Section 11.14_ shall not apply to covenants or
agreements in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed prior to
or at Closing.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.15_** **_Parent Assurances._** Geokinetics hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers the performance in
full by each Purchaser of the obligations of such Purchaser hereunder,
including, without limitation, the obligation of such Purchaser to pay the
Purchase Price payable by such Purchaser in accordance with _Section 1.4_
and the obligations of such Purchaser under _Article VII_.  Geokinetics
hereby waives all defenses as a surety including notice, and agrees that its
obligations under this _Section 11.15_ shall not be impaired, diminished or
discharged by any extension of time granted by the Sellers, by any course of
dealing between the parties, or by any events or circumstances that might
operate to discharge a guarantor. Geokinetics shall remain liable on
its obligations hereunder until such time as the obligations of the
Purchasers under this Agreement have expired.  Geokinetics waives the right
to require any Seller to first proceed against any Purchaser with respect to
any dispute, controversy, or claim

  



        
   

  



  

arising out of or related to this Agreement, and agrees that any such
dispute, controversy, or claim may be brought directly against Geokinetics,
the Purchasers, or against any one or more of them.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.16_** **_Agreement with Series B Holders._** At or prior
to the Effective Time, Geokinetics has entered into an agreement with the
Series B Holders related to the Transactions (the **_"Series B
Agreement"_**). Since the Effective Time, the Series B Agreement has not been
amended, modified or terminated. Geokinetics shall use its best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to implement and enforce the Series
B Agreement. Without the Sellers written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld in the case of actions required by the NYSE AMEX,
but which may be granted or withheld in the Sellers sole discretion in all
other instances), Geokinetics shall not change, amend, terminate or otherwise
modify the Series B Agreement or cancel or waive any obligation of the
applicable Series B Holders under the Series B Agreement. The parties agree
and understand that it shall not be unreasonable for any Seller to withhold
consent to any change, amendment, termination or modification contemplated in
the previous sentence if such action adversely impacts such Seller.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.17 Purchase Price Allocation._**

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) The portion of the Purchase Price (without regard to Assumed Liabilities,
Net Working Capital and Funded Indebtedness) allocated among the Purchased
Assets and the Purchased Securities shall be as set forth in _Section
11.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No party (or its Affiliates)
will assert or maintain a position inconsistent with this allocation in
connection with any Tax Return, Tax Audit or other matter related to Taxes.

  



  

(b) Within 60 days after the amount of the Cash Consideration has been
determined under _Section 1.6_, the Purchaser Tax Representative shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller Tax Representative a draft of a revised
_Section 11.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the **_"Final
Allocation Schedule"_** ) that takes into account the Cash Consideration and
the Assumed Liabilities. The allocations set forth on the Final Allocation
Schedule will be consistent with those in _Section 11.17(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and will be made in accordance with the principles of
Section 1060 of the Code.  The template of the Final Allocation Schedule is
attached hereto as _Section 11.17(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The
Tax Representatives shall work together, each acting in good faith, to agree
on the Final Allocation Schedule. In the event the Tax Representatives are
unable to agree on the Final Allocation Schedule in such manner, then each of
the Purchasers and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (acting
reasonably and in good faith) shall be free to use their own allocation of
the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets and the Purchased Securities,
_provided_  that any such allocation must be consistent with the allocation
set forth in _Section 11.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. In the
event the Tax Representatives do agree on the Final Allocation Schedule, then
such allocation shall be binding on the Purchasers, the Sellers, and their
respective Affiliates for federal, state, local, foreign and other Tax
reporting purposes, and none of them will assert or maintain a position
inconsistent with such allocation in connection with any Tax Return, Tax
Audit or other matter related to Taxes.

  



        
   

  



  

 ** _Section 11.18_** **_Control of Operations. _**Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Geokinetics or the Purchasers, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the conduct of the Business
prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over their operations, including the Business.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.19 Additional Sellers and Purchasers._**

  

 ** _ _**

  

(a) If, prior to Closing, PGS or a Subsidiary of PGS, other than a Business
Owning Entity, engages in the Business, PGS shall promptly notify Purchasers
of (i) the identity of the Subsidiary engaging in the Business, (ii) the
jurisdiction in which the Business is being conducted by the Subsidiary, and
(iii) a brief description of the Business conducted, and shall provide copies
of any Contracts related to such Business; _provided_ , that for this
purpose, submitting a bid for work will not constitute the conduct of the
Business. PGS and Geokinetics shall cooperate in good faith to transfer such
Business to a Purchaser (or another Subsidiary of Geokinetics which shall
become a Purchaser hereunder) at the Closing. Such cooperation shall include
PGS causing the Subsidiary engaged in the Business to enter into a
counterpart of this Agreement as an Asset Seller (or the parent of such
Subsidiary as a Seller) and Geokinetics designating a Purchaser (or another
Subsidiary of Geokinetics which shall become a party to this Agreement as a
Purchaser) to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities used in the
Business.

  



  

(b) Prior to Closing, PGS shall cause any Seller that is not a party to this
Agreement as of the Effective Date to (i) duly and validly authorize by all
requisite corporate or other organizational action the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary documents to which such
Seller is or will be a party, and (ii) execute and deliver to the Purchasers
a counterpart to this Agreement. In addition, PGS shall cause each Seller
listed on Section 1.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that has not executed
this Agreement on the Effective Date to comply with this Agreement as if such
Seller were a party to this Agreement from and after the Effective Date to
the date such Seller executes a counterpart of this Agreement as contemplated
by this Section. Nothing in this Section shall amend, alter or qualify any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that a Seller has made in
this Agreement.

  



  

 ** _Section 11.20_** **_Additional Services Agreement. _**If requested by
Sellers, Purchasers and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare, execute and deliver, or cause to be prepared, executed and
delivered, at Closing a services agreement, the form of which shall be
similar in form and scope to the Transition Services Agreement, in which PGS
Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (or its successor) shall provide certain mutually
agreed services to the data processing business unit of PGS conducted in
Mexico.

  



  



  

 **[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW]**

  



     

      
 

  



  

Geokinetics, the Purchasers, PGS and the Sellers have duly executed this
Agreement as of the Effective Date.
