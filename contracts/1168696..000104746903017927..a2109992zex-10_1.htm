Two (2)&nbsp;business&nbsp;days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to Buyer together with its calculation of the estimated Net
Working Capital based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). If the Estimated Net Working Capital is positive, the Cash Consideration will be increased by the amount of
the Estimated Net Working Capital. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is zero or less than zero but greater than negative $15,000,000, then the Cash Consideration will not be adjusted. If the
Estimated Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000, then the Cash Consideration will be decreased by the amount that the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000.
The amount, if any, by which the Cash Consideration is adjusted pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.5(a) is referred to herein as the "Closing Adjustment." As an example, (i)&nbsp;if the Estimated Net
Working Capital is negative $18,000,000, the Cash Consideration will be decreased by $3,000,000, (ii)&nbsp;if the Estimated Net Working Capital is negative
$14,000,000, no adjustment will be made to the Cash Consideration, and (iii)&nbsp;if the Estimated Net Working Capital is $5,000,000, the Cash Consideration will be increased by $5,000,000. It is
understood and agreed that Buyer is not purchasing cash, and Seller will have the right to sweep cash out of the Acquired Companies, provided that any cash remaining in any Acquired Company and set
forth on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet will be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital. </FONT></P>

review the related source documentation. The Closing Consideration will be subject to the following

the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration less than the True-up Amount, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the True-up Amount and
the Closing Adjustment and (C)&nbsp;if the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration greater than the True-up Amount, Seller will pay to Buyer the difference

Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche is not in a neutral and impartial position in relation to the parties as determined by Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche, the parties will have ten (10)&nbsp;business days from the
time of such submission to agree on substitute Accountants. Failing timely agreement, on the request of any party, the American Arbitration Association will designate a national accounting firm to
serve as Accountants. If issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for resolution, each party will furnish to the Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed issues as the Accountants may request, and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to the resolution of the disputed items and to discuss the
resolution of the disputed items with the Accountants. Promptly, but, if practicable, not later than fifteen (15)&nbsp;business&nbsp;days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the
Accountants will resolve (based solely on presentations of Buyer and Seller and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters.

Upon the written request of the Buyer, the Acquired Companies and Seller will join with Buyer in making elections under Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) of the IRC (and any corresponding
election under state, local and foreign tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares and the deemed purchase and sale of the capital stock of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the
"Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election"). Subject to the indemnification provisions of Section&nbsp;10.9(b), Seller will pay any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies that are attributable to the
making of the Section&nbsp;338(h)(10)&nbsp;Election, including, but not limited to, (i)&nbsp;any tax imposed under Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.338(h)(10)-1, or
(ii)&nbsp;any state, local or foreign Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies' gain. Seller at its expense will cooperate with Buyer in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis to provide
to Buyer such tax accounting and Tax Return information and documents relating to the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (assuming no 338(h)(10) Election is made), that may be
relevant to Buyer's decision to make a Section&nbsp;338(h)(10) Election. </FONT></P>

with their fair market value as reasonably determined by Buyer and Seller in accordance with Sections&nbsp;338 and 1060 of the IRC and the regulations thereunder (the "Allocation"). The Buyer will
initially determine the Allocation and prepare a completed set of IRS Forms 8023 (and any comparable forms required to be filed under applicable state, local, or foreign Tax law) (the
"Section&nbsp;8023 Forms") and any additional data or materials required to be attached to the Section&nbsp;8023 Forms pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section&nbsp;338 of
the IRC (and any applicable state, local, or foreign Tax law). Buyer will deliver the Section&nbsp;338 Forms to Seller for review no later than 60&nbsp;days prior to the date that such forms are
required to be filed. In the event Seller objects to the manner in which such forms have been prepared, the items set forth on such forms, or the Allocation, Seller will notify Buyer within
30&nbsp;days of receipt of such forms of such objection, and the parties will endeavor in good faith within the next 15&nbsp;days to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such
dispute within said 15&nbsp;day period, Buyer and Seller will submit such dispute to the Accountants and such dispute will be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section&nbsp;10.9(g). The Allocation will be appropriately adjusted as necessary to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price. </FONT></P>

Section&nbsp;10.9(c)&nbsp;of this Agreement, which will not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes will be prepared
and filed when due by Seller. Seller will provide such Tax Returns to Buyer at least 30 business&nbsp;days prior to the due date therefor. Buyer will be deemed to accept such Tax Returns unless
Buyer notifies Seller in writing of an objection within 10 business&nbsp;days of receipt. Any objection to such Tax Returns will be resolved pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.9(g). Buyer shall remit its
share of any Transfer Taxes to Seller no later than 2&nbsp;days prior to the due date of such Transfer Taxes.

If indemnification is sought for any Claim brought in connection with any breach of Section&nbsp;3.19 with respect to an Acquired Theatre, then Seller will have the right to

perform the Clean-up at its sole costs and expense. Seller will provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings with any Governmental Body regarding the

the current or future operations at the Acquired Theatre, including, without limitation, access to and egress from buildings and parking lots. Seller will employ properly qualified contractors and

the Clean-up, remove all equipment used in conducting that phase of the Clean-up, and restore the affected areas of the Acquired Theatre, including, without limitation, by
replacing or repairing any pavement, landscaping or other ground cover which was removed or damaged in connection with that phase of the Clean-up, to substantially the same condition and

SIZE=2><B>10.8 Procedure for Indemnification&#151;Third Party Claims</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section&nbsp;10.2 or 10.4, of notice of the assertion of liability by a third party ("Third Party Claim"), such indemnified
party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section, give written notice to the indemnifying party of such Third Party Claim, but the failure to notify the
indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
indemnifying party's failure to give such notice. This Section&nbsp;10.8 will not apply to Tax Claims governed by Section&nbsp;10.2 or 10.9. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
If any Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party and it gives prompt notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party will, unless the claim involves Taxes (which is addressed in Section&nbsp;10.9), assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, provided that the indemnifying party pursues the defense of such Third Party Claim in good
faith, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third
Party Claim subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the assertion of any Third Party
Claim and the indemnifying party does not, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days (or, if a lesser period is required in response to such Third Party Claim, then such lesser period) after the indemnified
party's notice is given, take appropriate action to defend such Third Party Claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party's counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i)&nbsp;no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the
indemnified party's consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A)&nbsp;the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are not required to be paid by the
indemnified party and (B)&nbsp;such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof a customary and complete release of the indemnified party from all liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim and (ii)&nbsp;the indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third Party Claim at
its sole expense; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, that</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (i)&nbsp;no indemnified party may settle or dispose of any Third Party Claim for which an indemnifying party may have
a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of such indemnifying party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A)&nbsp;the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are not required to be paid by the indemnifying party and (B)&nbsp;such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof a customary and complete release of
the indemnifying party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii)&nbsp;no indemnifying party will have any liability with respect to any settlement, compromise or discharge
effected without its consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in respect of any claim for which indemnity may be sought hereunder. No indemnified party will take any action
the purpose of which is to prejudice the defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or to induce a third party to assert a claim subject to indemnification hereunder. </FONT></P>

Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will each assist the other (and cause its respective affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will make available to each other upon written request and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested in writing all
relevant books and records relating to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Acquired Companies. Any such information will be kept strictly confidential. All such records and information will be retained until
30&nbsp;days following the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations (including any extension thereof); provided, however, that in the event a proceeding has been instituted prior to
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for which the information may be requested, the information will be retained until there is a final determination with respect to such
proceeding; Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, may dispose of any such information 30&nbsp;days after such party (the "Information Party") notifies
the other party (the "Recipient Party") in writing of the Information Party's intention to dispose of such information, provided, that if the Recipient Party notifies the Information Party, within
20&nbsp;days of the Information Party's notification, of the Recipient Party's desire to retain such information, the Information Party shall promptly deliver such information to the Recipient

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
Except as provided in Sections&nbsp;2.5(d)&nbsp;and Section&nbsp;10.9(h)&nbsp;herein, in the event of any claim, dispute or controversy of any nature between the parties
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, delivery, performance, nonperformance, validity, termination or breach thereof ("Dispute"), the parties will consult
and negotiate with each other in good faith and otherwise use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to settle such Dispute within a 45-day period after receipt by a party of
written notice of a Dispute. If for any reason, the Dispute is not resolved or settled within such 45-day period then, upon the demand of Buyer or Seller, the Dispute will be resolved by
binding arbitration in New York, New York in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 USC &sect; 1 et sec.) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules&nbsp;of the AAA, as they may be
amended from time to time (the "Rules") except as modified herein. An arbitration award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement, will be the sole and
exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the arbitral tribunal and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over
the parties or their property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
The Dispute will be resolved by a panel of three neutral and impartial arbitrators to be selected as follows: Buyer and Seller will each appoint one arbitrator within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. The two arbitrators so selected will, within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after notification of the identity of the second
arbitrator, choose a third arbitrator, who will serve as chair of the arbitral tribunal. Any arbitrator not timely appointed will, on the request of any party, be appointed by the AAA in accordance
with the listing, ranking and striking procedure in the Rules. Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator selected by it, one-half of the fees and expenses of the third
arbitrator and one half of the administrative costs and fees of the

costs should be borne by the other party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
In the absence of agreement by the parties as to pre-hearing discovery, the arbitral tribunal will order such discovery as it determines to be consistent with the needs
of the parties taking in to account the expedited nature of arbitration. The hearing will be held as promptly as possible, and if practicable, no later than one hundred and fifty (150)&nbsp;days
after the appointment of the third arbitrator. The arbitral tribunal will be required to follow the law of the State of New York. The arbitral tribunal is not empowered to award damages in excess of
compensatory damages, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any Dispute. The arbitration award will be in writing and
will specify factual and legal basis for the award. T he arbitral tribunal will have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of the State of New York could order or grant, including
specific performance of any obligation created under the Agreement, issuance of an injunction or money damages. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or
other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral
tribunal will have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to
award damages for the failure of any party to respect the arbitral tribunal's orders to that effect. The parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in
New York, New York (the "New York Courts") for the purpose of an order to compel arbitration, for preliminary relief in aid of arbitration or for a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo or
prevent irreparable harm prior to the appointment of the arbitrators, and to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the enforcement of any award issued hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
This agreement to arbitrate will be binding on all parties and their Affiliates, all Buyer Indemnified Persons, all Seller Indemnified Persons and on their respective successors and
assigns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>11.17 Specific Performance</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a)&nbsp;will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b)&nbsp;will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to
compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted hereunder. </FONT></P>
