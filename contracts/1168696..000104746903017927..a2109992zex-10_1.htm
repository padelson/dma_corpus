 2.5 Net Working Capital Adjustment. The Cash Consideration will be subject to adjustment as set forth in this Section 2.5. 

  

 (a) Two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to Buyer together with its calculation of the estimated Net Working Capital based on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). If the Estimated Net Working Capital is positive, the Cash Consideration will be increased by the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is zero or less than zero but greater than negative $15,000,000, then the Cash Consideration will not be adjusted. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000, then the Cash Consideration will be decreased by the amount that the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000. The amount, if any, by which the Cash Consideration is adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) is referred to herein as the "Closing Adjustment." As an example, (i) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is negative $18,000,000, the Cash Consideration will be decreased by $3,000,000, (ii) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is negative $14,000,000, no adjustment will be made to the Cash Consideration, and (iii) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is $5,000,000, the Cash Consideration will be increased by $5,000,000. It is understood and agreed that Buyer is not purchasing cash, and Seller will have the right to sweep cash out of the Acquired Companies, provided that any cash remaining in any Acquired Company and set forth on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet will be included in the calculation of Net Working Capital. 

  

 (b) Within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer a final balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the "Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet") and a calculation (the "Seller Calculation") of the final Net Working Capital (subject to resolution of any disputes pursuant to sections (c) and (d) below, the "Final Net Working Capital") based on the methodology set forth in Annex II. Seller will provide Buyer\'s accounting representatives access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to (i) observe the preparation of the Seller Calculation and (ii) whether during the preparation of or following the delivery to Buyer of the Seller Calculation, review the related source documentation. The Closing Consideration will be subject to the following    adjustment (the "Post-Closing Adjustment"), based on the Final Net Working Capital and calculated as follows: 

  

  

 (i) if the Final Net Working Capital is zero or less than zero and greater than negative $15,000,000, then (A) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in a reduction in the Cash Consideration, Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of the Closing Adjustment and (B) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration, Seller will pay to Buyer the amount of the Closing Adjustment; 

  

 (ii) if the Final Net Working Capital is greater than zero, then the "True-up Amount" will be equal to the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds zero and (A) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in a reduction in the Cash Consideration, Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of the Closing Adjustment plus the True-up Amount, (B) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration less than the True-up Amount, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the True-up Amount and the Closing Adjustment and (C) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration greater than the True-up Amount, Seller will pay to Buyer the difference between the Closing Adjustment and the True-up Amount; 

  

 (iii) if the Final Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000, then the True-up Amount will be equal to the amount that the Final Net Working Capital is less than negative $15,000,000 and (A) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in an increase in the Cash Consideration, Seller will pay to Buyer the amount of the Closing Adjustment plus the True-up Amount, (B) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in a reduction in the Cash Consideration less than the True-up Amount, Seller will pay to Buyer the difference between the True-up Amount and the Closing Adjustment and (C) if the Closing Adjustment resulted in a reduction in the Cash Consideration more than the True-up Amount, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the Closing Adjustment and the True-up Amount; and 

  

 (iv) otherwise, the Post-Closing Adjustment will be zero. 

  

  

 (c) In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to agree that the Seller Calculation is correct, and are unable to agree upon an alternative calculation of Final Net Working Capital within 30 days of Buyer receiving the Seller Calculation, then Buyer and Seller will use reasonable best efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the calculation of Final Net Working Capital within 15 days following such 30 day period, including the holding of direct discussions between Buyer\'s Chief Financial Officer and Parent\'s Chief Financial Officer. 

  

 (d) If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach agreement on the Final Net Working Capital by the end of such 15 day period, any issues remaining in dispute will be submitted to the Boston office of Deloitte and Touche (the "Accountants") for resolution. If, for any reason, at the time of such submission, Deloitte and Touche is unavailable to serve as Accountants or if Deloitte and Touche is not in a neutral and impartial position in relation to the parties as determined by Deloitte and Touche, the parties will have ten (10) business days from the time of such submission to agree on substitute Accountants. Failing timely agreement, on the request of any party, the American Arbitration Association will designate a national accounting firm to serve as Accountants. If issues in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for resolution, each party will furnish to the Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Accountants may request, and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accountants any material relating to the resolution of the disputed items and to discuss the resolution of the disputed items with the Accountants. Promptly, but, if practicable, not later than fifteen (15) business days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the Accountants will resolve (based solely on presentations of Buyer and Seller and not by independent review) only those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters. The resolution by the Accountants will be binding and conclusive on the parties and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction, and Buyer and Seller will each bear fifty    percent (50%) of the costs of the Accountants for such resolution. The Accountants will be instructed in performing the review that Buyer and Seller will each be provided with copies of any and all correspondence and drafts distributed to any party. Buyer and Seller will be granted access to information contained in the documents made available to the Accountants by the other party, provided that any information contained in the documents will be subject to Section 11.3 of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) All amounts payable under this Section 2.5 will be paid within five (5) business days following the final resolution of the Post-Closing Adjustment either out of Stock Escrow pursuant to Section 2.8 below or in immediately available funds to an account specified by the party entitled to such payment. 

  

 2.6 338(h)(10) Election.

  

 (a) Upon the written request of the Buyer, the Acquired Companies and Seller will join with Buyer in making elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the IRC (and any corresponding election under state, local and foreign tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares and the deemed purchase and sale of the capital stock of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 10.9(b), Seller will pay any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies that are attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including, but not limited to, (i) any tax imposed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1, or (ii) any state, local or foreign Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies\' gain. Seller at its expense will cooperate with Buyer in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis to provide to Buyer such tax accounting and Tax Return information and documents relating to the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (assuming no 338(h)(10) Election is made), that may be relevant to Buyer\'s decision to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 (b) If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, the Purchase Price and any other relevant items will be allocated among the assets of the Acquired Companies in accordance with their fair market value as reasonably determined by Buyer and Seller in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the IRC and the regulations thereunder (the "Allocation"). The Buyer will initially determine the Allocation and prepare a completed set of IRS Forms 8023 (and any comparable forms required to be filed under applicable state, local, or foreign Tax law) (the "Section 8023 Forms") and any additional data or materials required to be attached to the Section 8023 Forms pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the IRC (and any applicable state, local, or foreign Tax law). Buyer will deliver the Section 338 Forms to Seller for review no later than 60 days prior to the date that such forms are required to be filed. In the event Seller objects to the manner in which such forms have been prepared, the items set forth on such forms, or the Allocation, Seller will notify Buyer within 30 days of receipt of such forms of such objection, and the parties will endeavor in good faith within the next 15 days to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within said 15 day period, Buyer and Seller will submit such dispute to the Accountants and such dispute will be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10.9(g). The Allocation will be appropriately adjusted as necessary to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 2.7 Transfer Taxes. All excise, transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, filing, recordation, real property transfer, real property gains, and other similar Taxes resulting from the Contemplated Transactions (the "Transfer Taxes"), will be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Notwithstanding Section 10.9(c) of this Agreement, which will not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed when due by Seller. Seller will provide such Tax Returns to Buyer at least 30 business days prior to the due date therefor. Buyer will be deemed to accept such Tax Returns unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing of an objection within 10 business days of receipt. Any objection to such Tax Returns will be resolved pursuant to Section 10.9(g). Buyer shall remit its share of any Transfer Taxes to Seller no later than 2 days prior to the due date of such Transfer Taxes.  

  

 2.8 Escrow. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and except as otherwise set forth in the Escrow Agreement, at any time when any portion of the Stock Escrow remains subject to the Escrow Agreement, in the event that Seller is required to make any payment pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, or any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, any such amount payable by Seller to Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person will be paid out of the Stock Escrow in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement or in cash by Seller or any of its Affiliates, including Parent under the Parent Guarantee. The value of each share of Regal Stock paid out of the Stock Escrow will be equal to the Escrow Average Stock Price.

 (b) It is acknowledged that Seller will seek to implement the Restructuring in a manner not inconsistent with the methodology referred to in Annex IV of this Agreement provided that, in consultation with Buyer or at the request of Buyer, Seller may adopt alternate methodologies that will accomplish the Restructuring in a manner that minimizes the requirements for landlord consents. To the extent that Seller receives any consideration in connection with the Restructuring or the Excluded Operations, such consideration will be for Seller\'s account. 

  

 5.9 [Intentionally Omitted.] 

  

 5.10 Labor Issues. Seller will cause its Subsidiaries to perform and discharge all requirements, if any, under the WARN Act or under similar applicable state and local laws and regulations in connection with the Contemplated Transactions as a result of actions taken prior to the Closing. To the extent that any such requirements are triggered by actions taken by Buyer after the Closing with respect to the Acquired Companies, Buyer will perform and discharge all such requirements.

Seller will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to reasonably cooperate in connection with the issuance thereof, provided the same is at no cost or liability to Seller. By way of example, in no case will Seller or its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any Acquired Company, be obligated to deliver any instrument or affidavit required for Buyer to obtain zoning, non-imputation or comprehensive endorsements. 

  

 5.13 Payment of Severance Obligations. Seller will assume or discharge all liabilities of the Company with respect to severance payments, benefits and other obligations associated with the termination of any employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the Transferred Employees prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.14 Treatment of Company Guarantees. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts (provided that such obligation will not require Seller to exercise any buy-out option or otherwise purchase the leased equipment under any equipment lease) to have released and cancelled at or prior to the Closing each of the Company Guarantees, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company) to be substituted in all respects for any Acquired Company directly affected thereby in respect of each of the Company Guarantees. If Seller is unable to either release and cancel such Company Guarantee or cause itself or one of its Affiliates to be so substituted in respect of such Company Guarantee as of the Closing Date, then Seller will continue to use its reasonable best efforts thereafter to have released and cancelled as soon as practicable each of    the Company Guarantees, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company) to be substituted in all respects for any Acquired Company directly affected thereby in respect of each of the Company Guarantees. Following the Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with notice as soon as reasonably practicable following Seller\'s receipt of notice of a claim being made by a lessor under any lease that has the benefit of a Company Guarantee. 

   

 5.15 Treatment of 401(k) Accounts. Effective immediately prior to the Closing, Seller will assume the Hoyts Cinemas Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Seller 401 (k) Plan").

The parties will cooperate in the taking of any action and the filing of any documents that may be required in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities described herein. 

  

 5.16 Seller Updated Information. At or prior to the Closing, Seller may notify Buyer of any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or otherwise disclosed on the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Seller Updated Information"). Such Seller Updated Information will not be deemed to have been set forth or otherwise disclosed as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

  

    

  5.17 Critical Theatre Level Software. Seller will arrange for the
Acquired Companies to have, for the Critical Theatre Level Software Period,
all rights necessary for the use and enjoyment of the Critical Theatre Level
Software in an equivalent manner in all material respects as the Critical
Theatre Level Software is being used as of the date hereof at the Acquired
Theatres, such Critical Theatre Level Software to be provided to the Acquired
Companies at a cost no greater in the aggregate than Seller\'s cost as of the
date hereof and on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the terms on
which such Critical Theatre Level Software is being used by the Acquired
Companies as of the date hereof; provided, that Seller shall have the right,
in its reasonable discretion and after consultation with Buyer, to provide
alternative software that has equivalent functionality in all material
respects as the ICON software and/or the Theatron Data System software, which
alternative software shall for purposes hereof be deemed part of the Critical
Theatre Level Software. Buyer shall have the right to inspect (at
Buyer\'s cost, during normal business hours and upon reasonable written
notice to Seller) five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the Critical
Theatre Level Software. For the purposes hereof, "Critical Theatre Level
Software Period" shall mean the period of time commencing on the Closing Date
and continuing for a period of time to be mutually agreed upon by the parties,
but failing such agreement to be six (6) months; provided, that such period
may be extended for up to an additional three (3) months, subject to the
approval of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld), in the event that Buyer
requests in writing, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of such
period, that Seller continue to provide the Critical Theatre Level Software
for up to an additional three (3)-month period and, at the time of such
request, Seller plans to have a substantial information technology capability
at the Company Headquarters.

 6.4 Treatment of Seller Guarantees. Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts (provided that such obligation will not require Buyer to exercise any buy-out option in connection with or otherwise purchase the leased equipment under any equipment lease) to cooperate with Seller to have released    and cancelled at or prior to the Closing each of the Seller Guarantees and any guaranty of lease or obligation as prior tenant of lease of the Seller or any Affiliate in connection with the Buyer\'s Ronkonkoma Stadium 9 Theatre located in Ronkonkoma, New York ("Seller Contingent Obligation"), including using its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller and each of Seller\'s Affiliates directly affected thereby in respect of each of the Seller Guarantees or Seller Contingent Obligation as of the Closing Date. If Buyer is unable to either release and cancel such Seller Guarantee or Seller Contingent Obligation or cause itself or one of its Affiliates to be so substituted in respect of such Seller Guarantee or Seller Contingent Obligation as of the Closing Date, then Buyer will continue to use its reasonable best efforts thereafter to have released and cancelled as soon as practicable each of the Seller Guarantees, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller and each of Seller\'s Affiliates directly affected thereby in respect of each of the Seller Guarantees or Seller Contingent Obligation.

Such records may be sought under this Section 6.5 for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, tax, litigation, federal securities disclosure or other similar needs of the party seeking such records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by Buyer if Buyer sends to Seller written notice of its intent to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the 30th day following such notice unless Seller notifies Buyer that Seller desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event Buyer will transfer the records to Seller and Seller will pay all reasonable expenses of Buyer in connection therewith. 

  

 6.6 New York Stock Exchange Listing. Buyer will have approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the Closing Date, subject to official notice of issuance, the Regal Shares.

Following the Closing, with respect to each employee benefit or compensation plan of Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate in which any Transferred Employee participates (a "Buyer Plan"), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of pension benefits under any defined benefit pension plan), service prior to the Closing with the Company, Seller or any Affiliate (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or Seller provided past service credit) will be treated as service with Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate of either; provided, however, that such service will not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also will apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition limitations. Each Buyer Plan will waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Plan. Transferred Employees will be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for amounts paid under a corresponding Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and    out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of Buyer Plan.

The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect the    right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements.

 (v) the Excluded Operations; 

  

 (vi) the Restructuring (other than Transfer Taxes resulting from the Restructuring for which Buyer is liable under Section 2.7);

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 10.3, the procedure described in Section 10.8 will apply to any Claim for which indemnification may be sought in connection with any breach of Section 3.19. The rights and remedies contained in this Agreement will constitute the sole and exclusive means for recourse with respect to the Facilities or the business of the Acquired Companies relating to any Environmental Law, and Buyer and Seller expressly waive any and all claims, rights, or causes of action that Buyer may have against Seller or which Seller may have against Buyer now or in the future arising under, in connection with or relating to any Environmental Law (whether by statute, regulation or common law), except that (i) Seller does not waive claims, rights or causes of action relating to Environmental Releases that took place after the Closing Date or violations of Environmental Laws that occur after the Closing Date in connection with Acquired Theatres and (ii) Buyer does not waive claims, rights or causes of action relating to Environmental Releases that took place after the Closing Date or violations of Environmental Laws that occur after the Closing Date at the Excluded Theatres. 

  

 (b) If indemnification is sought for any Claim brought in connection with any breach of Section 3.19 with respect to an Excluded Theatre, Seller will be solely responsible for performing and controlling such Clean-up and will perform such Clean-up at its sole cost and expense and shall (i) except in an emergency, provide reasonable advance notice to Buyer of any Clean-up prior to undertaking it; (ii) keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of any such Clean-up and the schedule for completing such Clean-up; (iii) except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, within 7 business days of receipt, submit to Buyer copies of all written communications, filings, reports, correspondence or other documents received from any person in connection with any such Clean-up; (iv) provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to comment in advance upon any written communications, filings, reports, correspondence or other documents given to any Governmental Body in connection with such Clean-up and will consider timely provided comments in good faith; (v) perform the Clean-up in accordance with applicable law and any applicable leases or other contracts, and in a professional and workman like manner; and (vi) perform the Clean-up as necessary to obtain a "no further action" letter or similar document from the Governmental Body with jurisdiction over the Clean-up. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer from any Claims arising from Seller\'s performance or failure to perform the Clean-Up in accordance with this section. 

  

 (c) If indemnification is sought for any Claim brought in connection with any breach of Section 3.19 with respect to an Acquired Theatre, then Seller will have the right to control such Clean-up if and to the extent permitted by the applicable lease. In performing the Clean-up, Seller will comply with Section 10.3(b)(i)-(vi) and will perform the Clean-up at its sole costs and expense. Seller will provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to participate in any meetings with any Governmental Body regarding the Clean-up. Seller will have access to the Acquired Theatre only as reasonably necessary to perform the Clean-up and will not unreasonably interfere with the ordinary conduct of the current or future operations at the Acquired Theatre, including, without limitation, access to and egress from buildings and parking lots. Seller will employ properly qualified contractors and consultants to perform the Clean-up. Any equipment or structures used in connection with the Clean-up will be left in a manner so as not to present a risk of injury or harm to the Buyer, its guests, invitees, or any other person who may come onto the Acquired Theatre, and so as not to require any maintenance by Buyer. Seller will promptly upon the completion of any phase of the Clean-up, remove all equipment used in conducting that phase of the Clean-up, and restore the affected areas of the Acquired Theatre, including, without limitation, by replacing or repairing any pavement, landscaping or other ground cover which was removed or damaged in connection with that phase of the Clean-up, to substantially the same condition and appearance as that existed immediately prior to the commencement of the Clean-up. Seller agrees to provide and maintain, or require each of its contractors and consultants to provide and maintain, at no expense to Buyer or its Affiliates and at all times during the course of any Clean-up and for one year thereafter, insurance coverage with such limits and terms as are    commercially reasonable under the circumstances. Seller agrees to keep any Acquired Facility free and clear of any liens that may arise as a result of the Clean-up, and to indemnify Buyer from any Claims arising from Seller\'s performance or failure to perform the Clean-up in accordance with this Section 10.3(b). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.3, the failure to provide notice to the indemnifying party under this Section 10.3 will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. 

  

 10.4 Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Buyer. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Section 10, if the Closing occurs, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Representatives, stockholders, and Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") for, and will pay to the Seller Indemnified Persons the amount of any Damages (including incidental and consequential damages that may be included in Damages solely as a result of such Damages having been awarded to a third party under a Third Party Claim) asserted against or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Person arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with: 

  

  

 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement; provided that for purposes of indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.4(a)(i), any breach of any representation or warranty (other than any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.9) will be determined without regard to (A) any qualification related to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or (B) any Buyer Updated Information); 

  

 (ii) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer in this Agreement;

 (iv) the Seller Guarantees; or 

  

 (v) any amendment, termination, rescission or breach or alleged breach by Buyer or any Acquired Company after the Closing of any Applicable Contract or Acquired Lease.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will have the right to subrogation with respect to any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable but not yet paid to any Seller Indemnified Person with respect to any Damages incurred by such Seller Indemnified Person.

 10.8 Procedure for IndemnificationThird Party Claims. 

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10.2 or 10.4, of notice of the assertion of liability by a third party ("Third Party Claim"), such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section, give written notice to the indemnifying party of such Third Party Claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party\'s failure to give such notice. This Section 10.8 will not apply to Tax Claims governed by Section 10.2 or 10.9. 

  

 (b) If any Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party and it gives prompt notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes (which is addressed in Section 10.9), assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, provided that the indemnifying party pursues the defense of such Third Party Claim in good faith, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the assertion of any Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party does not, within thirty (30) days (or, if a lesser period is required in response to such Third Party Claim, then such lesser period) after the indemnified party\'s notice is given, take appropriate action to defend such Third Party Claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party\'s counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party. 

  

 (c) If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party\'s consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are not required to be paid by the indemnified party and (B) such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof a customary and complete release of the indemnified party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii) the indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third Party Claim at its sole expense; _provided, that_ (i) no indemnified party may settle or dispose of any Third Party Claim for which an indemnifying party may have a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of such indemnifying party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (A) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are not required to be paid by the indemnifying party and (B) such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof a customary and complete release of the indemnifying party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii) no indemnifying party will have any liability with respect to any settlement, compromise or discharge effected without its consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in respect of any claim for which indemnity may be sought hereunder. No indemnified party will take any action the purpose of which is to prejudice the defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or to induce a third party to assert a claim subject to indemnification hereunder. 

   

 10.9 Tax Claims. The following provisions will apply with respect to Taxes: 

  

 (a)  _Seller\'s Indemnification_. Subject to Section 10.9(b), Seller, without any right of contribution from the Acquired Companies, without regard to the limitations in Section 10.6 will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from, against and in respect of (i) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including     the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Straddle Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated combined or unitary group of which the Acquired Companies (or any predecessor of the Acquired Companies) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Acquired Companies) imposed on the Acquired Companies as a transferee, as a successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which obligation arises pursuant to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date or on the Closing Date prior to the Closing, and (iv) the portion of the Transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 2.7, _provided, however_ , that Seller will have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless Buyer pursuant to this Section 10.9(a) or Section 10.2 to the extent of Taxes included as current liabilities for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital. 

  

 (b)  _Buyer\'s Indemnification_. Without regard to the limitations in Section 10.7, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from, against and in respect of any liability of Seller or the Acquired Companies for (i) any Taxes imposed on Seller or the Acquired Companies with respect to any period beginning after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period") and any portion of any Straddle Period beginning immediately after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Straddle Period"); (ii) the portion of the Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable pursuant to Section 2.7; (iii) all Taxes of Seller, its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies attributable to operations, acts or omissions of Buyer or the Acquired Companies occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing other than in the Ordinary Course of Business (including but not limited to the making of any Tax elections on the Closing Date after the Closing and any merger, consolidation, or liquidation of the Acquired Companies occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing); and (iv) in the event that a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made pursuant to Section 2.6, the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable (including pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 10.9(a)) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby, including the transactions consummated pursuant to the Restructuring, over (ii) the amount of Taxes for which Seller would have been liable (including pursuant to Sections 2.7 and 10.9(a)) as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the transactions consummated pursuant to the Restructuring, if no such Section 338(h)(10) Election had been made. 

  

 (c)  _Tax Returns_. 

  

  

 (i) _Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods_. Seller will cause to be included the income, gains, losses, deductions, and other applicable Tax Items of the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods") on Seller\'s (or its Affiliates\') consolidated United States federal income Tax Return or Returns as applicable and on Seller\'s (or its Affiliates\') consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns filed for state, local or foreign income Tax purposes on a basis consistent with past Tax Returns, including the utilization of the same accounting methods and elections used for the preparation of such Tax Returns in prior periods, except to the extent required by relevant Tax law, _provided, however,_ that all transactions occurring other than in the Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date after the Closing will be reported on the separate consolidated United States federal income Tax Return of the Company, Buyer, or its Affiliates, as applicable, to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), and will be similarly reported on other income Tax Returns of Buyer and the Acquired Companies to the extent permitted by law. Seller will cause all such income Tax Returns to be timely filed. Seller also will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all other Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies required to be filed for Pre-Closing Tax Periods on a basis consistent with past Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies, including the utilization of the same accounting methods and elections used for the preparation of such Tax Returns in prior periods, except to the extent required by relevant Tax law. With respect to Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that include the Closing Date, Seller will allow Buyer a period no less than 30 days before the filing of all such Tax Returns and any    amendments of such Tax Returns to review all such Tax Returns (and any amendments of such Tax Returns). Seller will notify Buyer in writing upon the delivery to Buyer of such Tax Returns (and any amendments of such Tax Returns) of any positions contained therein that are inconsistent with positions taken on prior Tax Returns. Seller will cooperate in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis with Buyer to address any concerns or questions of Buyer with respect to such Tax Returns (or any amendments of such Tax Returns), including the amount and calculation of any taxable income and loss and Tax Items shown thereon. Any dispute relating to the treatment of an item on such Tax Returns (or any amendments of such Tax Returns) will be resolved pursuant to Section 10.9(g). Seller will timely remit to the relevant taxing authority all unpaid Taxes shown on such Tax Returns (or any amendments of such Tax Returns). All amendments of any Tax Returns described in this Section 10.9(c)(i) shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past Tax Returns, including the utilization of the same accounting methods and elections used for the preparation of such Tax Returns in prior periods, except to the extent required by relevant Tax law. Seller will provide Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable with copies of income Tax Returns of Seller for the period ended June 2002 that include the operations of all or any of the Acquired Companies. 

  

 (ii) _Tax Returns for Straddle Periods_. Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods") and, to the extent the filing of such Tax Returns by Buyer could reasonably be expected to increase any Tax otherwise payable by any Acquired Company or the Seller for any Pre-Closing Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period, on a basis consistent with past Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies, including the utilization of the same accounting methods and elections used for the preparation of such Tax Returns in prior periods, except to the extent required by relevant Tax law. Buyer will allow Seller a period of at least 30 days before the filing of such Tax Returns to review such Tax Returns. Buyer will notify Seller in writing upon the delivery to Seller of such Tax Returns of any positions contained therein that are inconsistent with positions taken on prior Tax Returns. Buyer will cooperate in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis with Seller to address any concerns or questions of Seller with respect to such Tax Returns. At least two (2) days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller will pay Buyer or the Acquired Companies the amount of undisputed and unpaid Taxes shown on such Tax Returns that relate to Pre-Closing Straddle Periods (as determined in accordance with Section 10.9(d)). Buyer will, or will cause the Acquired Companies to, timely remit to the relevant taxing authority all unpaid Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. Any dispute relating to the treatment of any item on such Tax Returns will be resolved pursuant to Section 10.9(g). 

  

  

 (d)  _Apportionment of Taxes_. To the extent permitted by law or administrative practice, Seller, Buyer, and the Acquired Companies will cause the taxable periods of the Acquired Companies to end on and include the Closing Date. For purposes of determining the Taxes or other Tax Items of the Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period or Post-Closing Straddle Period, such Taxes and other Tax Items will be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period based upon an interim closing of the books of the Acquired Companies; _provided, that_  exemptions, allowances, and deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions), lower bracket amounts, and Taxes calculated on a periodic basis (such as real property Taxes) will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period in proportion to the number of days in each such period. 

  

 (e)  _Contest Provisions_. 

  

  

 (i) Each of Buyer and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (the "Recipient"), will notify the Vice PresidentTaxes or chief tax officer of the other party in writing within 30 days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened    audit, deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim relating to Taxes (a "Tax Audit") that could affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Recipient fails to give such prompt notice to the other party, it will not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit if and to the extent that such other party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. 

  

 (ii) _Seller\'s Items_. To the extent that a Tax Audit relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Pre-Closing Straddle Period, Seller will at its expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit, except as provided below. To the extent that such Tax Audit relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period could affect the Taxes or Tax Items of Buyer or any Acquired Company for any Post-Closing Straddle Period or Post-Closing Tax Period, (A) Seller will allow Buyer to participate in such defense and settlement at its expense; (B) Seller will promptly provide to Buyer any written correspondence received from the relevant taxing authority in connection with such Tax Audit; (C) Seller will provide to Buyer for its review any written correspondence, materials or other documentation to be delivered to the relevant taxing authority at least 5 business days prior to such delivery; (D) Seller will cooperate in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis with Buyer to address any concerns or questions of Buyer with respect to such Tax Audit; and (E) neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller will settle, compromise, or otherwise agree to any resolution of such Tax Audit (or any portion thereof) without the prior written consent of Buyer. In the event that Buyer fails to consent to any settlement, compromise, or resolution of such Tax Audit (or any portion thereof), Buyer will, at its own expense, assume control of the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit and will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of any Taxes resulting from such Tax Audit (or portion thereof) over (ii) the amount of Taxes that would have resulted from such Tax Audit (or portion thereof) had such Tax Audit (or portion thereof) been settled, compromised or resolved in the manner proposed by Seller. 

  

 (iii) _Buyer\'s Items_. To the extent that a Tax Audit relates to any Post-Closing Tax Period or any Post-Closing Straddle Period, Buyer will, at its expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit.

 (iv) _Straddle Periods_. If any Taxes or Tax Items relating to a Straddle Period relate to both Pre-Closing Straddle Periods and Post-Closing Straddle Periods, the party that has the greater potential liability for those Tax Items shall control the Acquired Companies\' interests therein, provided that such party defends, in good faith, the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return, subject to the participation, document delivery and settlement provisions set forth in Sections 10.9(e)(ii) and (iii). 

  

 (v) _General Cooperation_. In addition to the general obligations of Buyer and Seller set forth in this Section 10.9(e), Buyer and Seller will (A) cooperate with each other on a good faith and commercially reasonable basis in preparing for any Tax Audit, and (B) promptly furnish the other    copies of all relevant correspondence received from any tax authority in connection with any Tax Audit or information request relating to Taxes for which such other party may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. 

  

  

 (f) _Tax Refund and Overpayments._

  

  

 (i) If after the Closing, Buyer or the Acquired Companies receives any refund or utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which either (x) relates to Taxes paid by Seller or the Acquired Companies with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Pre-Closing Straddle Periods, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer will promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) resolved or utilized by Buyer or the Acquired Companies. Buyer agrees to notify Seller within 15 days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment. 

  

 (ii) If after the Closing, Seller receives any refund or utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which either (x) relates to Taxes paid by Buyer or the Acquired Companies with respect to Post-Closing Tax Periods, or Post-Closing Straddle Periods, or (y) is the subject of indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, Seller will promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Buyer the entire amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest) resolved or utilized by Seller. Seller agrees to notify Buyer within 15 days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Seller agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish to Buyer all information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment. 

  

  

 (g)  _Resolution of All Tax-Related Disputes_. In the event that Seller and Buyer disagree on the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes, the treatment of any item on any Tax Return, or the interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement relating to Taxes, including the resolution of any Tax Audit, Seller and Buyer will promptly consult each other in an effort to resolve such dispute. If any such point of disagreement cannot be resolved within 15 business days of the date of receipt by one party from the other of written notice of a dispute, such dispute will be submitted to the Accountants and resolved using the procedures set forth in Section 2.5(d). The resolution of the Accountants will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. All fees and expenses related to the work performed by the Accountants will be borne fifty percent (50%) by each of Seller and Buyer.

 (h) _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to Damages resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.11 (which, subject to the last sentence of this Section 10.9(h), are subject to indemnification under Section 10.2(a)), this Section 10.9 alone will govern all claims for indemnification for or with respect to Taxes, notwithstanding the other provisions of Section 10\. Seller and Buyer intend that this Section 10.9 shall apply, and Section 10.2(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Taxes indemnifiable by Seller to Buyer under this Section 10.9. 

  

 (i)  _Payments_. Unless otherwise provided herein, all payments required to be made under this Section 10.9 or Section 2.7, including payments of indemnification of Tax, will be made in immediately available funds within five (5) business days of receipt of a written notice from the party entitled to such payment which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis and an explanation of the claim hereunder, but where applicable, in no event earlier than two (2) business days before the date on which such amounts are to be paid to the relevant taxing authority.  

  

 (j)  _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Neither Buyer nor the Acquired Companies will amend, re-file, or otherwise modify any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period (but only to extent that such modifications relate to amounts allocable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Periods), or waive any limitation period with respect to such Tax Returns, relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies without the written consent of Seller, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Upon the written request of Buyer, and at Buyer\'s expense, Seller will prepare and file amendments to its income Tax Returns filed with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods ending on or before June 2002, that include the operations of all or any of the Acquired Companies, to properly adjust reporting positions taken on such Tax Returns which positions adjust positions taken on prior Tax Returns. 

  

 (k) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. The parties agree that any payments made pursuant to Section 2.5 or Section 10 hereof will be treated for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

  

 (l)  _Tax Attributes_. No provision of this Agreement will be construed as a representation, warranty, covenant, or guaranty by Seller of the net operating losses, alternative minimum tax net operating losses, capital loss carryovers, alternative minimum tax credits, or other Tax attributes of the Acquired Companies (the "Tax Items"). Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement, Seller will have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or the Acquired Companies for, or with respect to, any disallowance, unavailability, or lack of Tax Items.

 10.11 No Duplication; Sole Remedy.

   

 (a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder will be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 (b) The respective rights to indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons as provided for in Sections 10.2 and 10.4, as applicable, for a breach of this Agreement, will constitute such party\'s sole and exclusive remedy for such a breach and the breaching party will have no other liability or damages to the other party resulting from the breach, except that nothing herein will relieve a party from liability for fraud.

 10.13 [Intentionally Omitted] 

  

 10.14 Reduction of Damages Attributable to an Actual Tax Benefit. 

   

 Damages incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, that are indemnifiable under this Section 10 will be reduced by an amount equal to any reduction in income Taxes actually paid with respect to a Tax period on account of the application of a deduction or other Tax Item attributable directly to such Damages, and the creation or increase in the amount of a net operating loss carryover or a carryover of another Tax Item shall not be treated as a reduction in the income Taxes actually paid with respect to such Tax period; _provided, that,_ such reduction in Damages will apply only if (i) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, promptly upon payment of the indemnified amount under this Section 10 has notified the other in writing of such amount and the    recipient\'s potential entitlement to a reduction of income Taxes on account of such Damages and/or indemnity payment and (ii)(a) the actual reduction of income Taxes paid occurs with respect to the same Tax period as the application of a deduction (other than the application of a net operating loss carryover) or other Tax Item (other than a Tax Item carried over from a prior Tax period) attributable directly to such Damages or (b) the actual reduction of income Taxes paid as a result of the application of a net operating loss carryover or other Tax Item carried over from a prior Tax period attributable directly to such Damages occurs with respect to a Tax period ending prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing. In the event this Section 10.14 results in a reduction in the amount of Damages, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, will reimburse the other for the amount of such reduction net of any income Taxes payable with respect to the receipt of the indemnity payment attributable to such Damages.

Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.

This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment. 

  

 11.8 Disclosure Schedules. 

  

 (a) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule with respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control. 

  

 (b) The disclosures in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, and those in any supplement thereto, unless otherwise set forth or referenced therein, relate only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement. 

  

 11.9 Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights. No party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties except that Buyer may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer and Seller may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Seller, _provided, that_ in either case no assignment will limit, relieve or otherwise affect the assignor\'s obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement (and, with respect to Section 6.2, Mr. James Packer) any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns. 

   

 11.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in Section or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. 

  

 11.11 Section Headings, Construction. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. 

   

 11.12 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. 

  

 11.13 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of New York without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.  

  

 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 11.15 Tax Assistance. The parties agree that, after the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will each assist the other (and cause its respective affiliates to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing; 

  

 (b) Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will make available to each other upon written request and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested in writing all relevant books and records relating to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Acquired Companies. Any such information will be kept strictly confidential. All such records and information will be retained until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations (including any extension thereof); provided, however, that in the event a proceeding has been instituted prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for which the information may be requested, the information will be retained until there is a final determination with respect to such proceeding; Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, may dispose of any such information 30 days after such party (the "Information Party") notifies the other party (the "Recipient Party") in writing of the Information Party\'s intention to dispose of such information, provided, that if the Recipient Party notifies the Information Party, within 20 days of the Information Party\'s notification, of the Recipient Party\'s desire to retain such information, the Information Party shall promptly deliver such information to the Recipient Party; and 

  

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(a), the party requesting assistance or cooperation will bear the other party\'s out-of-pocket expenses in complying with such request to the extent that those expenses are attributable to fees and other costs of unaffiliated third-party service providers. 

  

 11.16 Arbitration

  

 (a) Except as provided in Sections 2.5(d) and Section 10.9(h) herein, in the event of any claim, dispute or controversy of any nature between the parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, delivery, performance, nonperformance, validity, termination or breach thereof ("Dispute"), the parties will consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and otherwise use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to settle such Dispute within a 45-day period after receipt by a party of written notice of a Dispute. If for any reason, the Dispute is not resolved or settled within such 45-day period then, upon the demand of Buyer or Seller, the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration in New York, New York in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 USC § 1 et sec.) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as they may be amended from time to time (the "Rules") except as modified herein. An arbitration award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement, will be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the arbitral tribunal and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their property. 

  

 (b) The Dispute will be resolved by a panel of three neutral and impartial arbitrators to be selected as follows: Buyer and Seller will each appoint one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. The two arbitrators so selected will, within twenty (20) days after notification of the identity of the second arbitrator, choose a third arbitrator, who will serve as chair of the arbitral tribunal. Any arbitrator not timely appointed will, on the request of any party, be appointed by the AAA in accordance with the listing, ranking and striking procedure in the Rules. Each party will pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator selected by it, one-half of the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator and one half of the administrative costs and fees of the    arbitration. All other fees and expenses of each party incurred in connection with the arbitration will be borne by the party incurring such costs, unless the arbitral tribunal determines that such costs should be borne by the other party. 

  

 (c) In the absence of agreement by the parties as to pre-hearing discovery, the arbitral tribunal will order such discovery as it determines to be consistent with the needs of the parties taking in to account the expedited nature of arbitration. The hearing will be held as promptly as possible, and if practicable, no later than one hundred and fifty (150) days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. The arbitral tribunal will be required to follow the law of the State of New York. The arbitral tribunal is not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any Dispute. The arbitration award will be in writing and will specify factual and legal basis for the award. T he arbitral tribunal will have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of the State of New York could order or grant, including specific performance of any obligation created under the Agreement, issuance of an injunction or money damages. 

   

 (d) By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal will have full authority to grant provisional remedies and to direct the parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to respect the arbitral tribunal\'s orders to that effect. The parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York, New York (the "New York Courts") for the purpose of an order to compel arbitration, for preliminary relief in aid of arbitration or for a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo or prevent irreparable harm prior to the appointment of the arbitrators, and to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the enforcement of any award issued hereunder. 

  

 (e) This agreement to arbitrate will be binding on all parties and their Affiliates, all Buyer Indemnified Persons, all Seller Indemnified Persons and on their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 11.17 Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted hereunder.
