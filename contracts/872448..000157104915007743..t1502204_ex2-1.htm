AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 19, 2015 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Dialog Semiconductor plc, a company
incorporated in England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), Avengers Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(" _Merger Sub_ "), and Atmel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined where
first used have the respective meanings ascribed to them in _Section 8.3(e)_.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

A. The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub have determined that the transactions described herein are in the
best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and,
accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company and Parent have agreed to
effect the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "),
other than any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct
or indirect subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, will
be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1120 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ,"
which, for the avoidance of doubt, may also be expressed as 0.1120 ordinary
shares of 10 pence each of Parent (the " _Parent Ordinary Shares_ ") per
share of Company Common Stock) American Depositary Shares of Parent, with
each ADS representing one Parent Ordinary Shares (the " _ADSs_ "), and (ii) an
amount of cash as provided in _Section 2.1_.

  



  

B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")
has unanimously determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to the
Company and its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ ").

  



  

C. The Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has
unanimously determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to Parent and
its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders_ ").

  



  

D. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, Company, Parent and Merger Sub, in consideration of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, agree
as follows:

  



    



 



    



  

Article I 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or,
if permitted, waiver of conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with
the DGCL, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company at the Effective
Time, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon
cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company will be the surviving company
(the " _Surviving Company_ ").

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto,
California, at 8:00 a.m. (California time) no later than the second Business
Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
___Article VI_  (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing; provided, however, that the
Closing Date shall not occur on or prior to the 15th calendar day period
immediately following the date on which the SEC has declared the
effectiveness of the Form F-4, provided that (i) such period shall
exclude the days from November 26, 2015 to November 29, 2015 and (ii) the
entirety of such period must end prior to December 18, 2015 or commence after
January 4, 2016 (the " _Marketing Period_ "), in which case the Closing Date
shall occur on the first Business Day immediately following the final day of
the Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in ___Article VI_ for the Closing as of
the date that would have been the Closing Date if not for this proviso and
provided that in no event will the extension of the Closing Date pursuant to
this proviso be deemed to create any condition to Closing in addition to
those set forth in ___Article VI_ ). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
Parent may shorten the Marketing Period by delivering written notice to the
Company specifying an earlier Closing Date during the Marketing Period (the "
_Parent Specified Closing Date_ "), provided that notice of the Parent
Specified Closing Date is delivered to the Company at least two Business Days
prior to the Parent Specified Closing Date.

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, (i) as soon as practicable on the Closing
Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the terms of this Agreement and (ii)
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date, or at
such subsequent date or time as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be
vested in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company all as provided in the DGCL.

  



  

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, the Company Charter in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_
and, as so amended, shall be from and after the Effective Time the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until amended in
accordance with applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Company from and after the Effective Time, until amended in
accordance with applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws and any Contracts between a director,
officer or employee of the Company and the Company in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing will govern the rights of all directors,
officers and employees of the Company (including, without limitation, persons
who were, at any time, directors, officers and employees of the Company prior
to Closing), as applicable, and the obligations of the Company and the
Surviving Company, in respect of claims for indemnification based in whole or
in part on actions or failures to take action at or prior to the Closing, and
neither the amendments thereto contemplated hereby or any amendments or
modifications, if any, effected following the Closing will affect, in any
manner, the rights of any directors, officers and employees, or the
obligations of the Company, including the Surviving Company, thereunder
relating to such actions or failures to take action.

  



  

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. From and
after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and
(ii) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Company.

  



  

Article II 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

  



  

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub 's Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Company
with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Company, subject to  _Section 2.1(b)_.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock and
Conversion of Subsidiary Owned Stock_. (i) Each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time will automatically be canceled and

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any
Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Company such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Company immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section
2.2(e)_, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares to be treated in accordance with
_Section 2.4,_ will be converted into the right to receive (i) $4.65 in cash
(the " _Cash Consideration_ ") without interest and (ii) a number of ADSs
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash
Consideration, the Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional ADSs as
contemplated by _Section 2.2(e)_ are consideration for the acquisition of
the shares in the Company and are referred to collectively as the " _Merger
Consideration_."

  



  

(d) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or book entry shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends
or other distributions, if any, upon surrender or transfer of such Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in accordance with this
___Article II_ , without interest.

  



  

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
designate a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things,
mailing and receiving transmittal letters and distributing the
Merger Consideration to the Company Stockholders (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Depositary Bank, or any successor
depositary thereto, a number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the aggregate
number of ADSs to be issued as Merger Consideration and (ii) deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this  __ _Article II_ , through the
Exchange Agent, (x) immediately available funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration and (y) the receipts (or uncertificated book-
entries, as applicable) representing such aggregate number of ADSs, and the
Depositary Bank shall be authorized to issue the ADSs representing such
Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this Agreement (such cash and such
ADSs (whether evidenced by receipts or book-entries), together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the
Effective Time and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional ADSs, in each
case to be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders
of the Company Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). No later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall
enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in form and

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to effect the applicable
terms of this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) Promptly, and in any event within 10 Business Days, after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates will
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange
Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures
set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal
will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify consistent with this Agreement) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, the transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(ii) After the Effective Time, and reasonably promptly following
surrender or transfer in accordance with this ___Article II_ of a Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in the form of (A) the number
of whole ADSs that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this ___Article II_ , after taking into account all the shares
of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Book-Entry
Shares or Company Certificates so surrendered or transferred, and (B) a check
or wire for the full amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this ___Article II_ , including the Cash
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional ADSs, certain dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_, in each case
less any required withholding of Taxes, and the Company Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred will forthwith be canceled, and
Parent's register of members shall be updated accordingly. The ADSs shall be
accepted into The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") and issued in
uncertificated book-entry form to such account as shall be specified in the
completed letter of transmittal, unless a physical ADR is requested or
otherwise required by applicable Law, in which case Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send such receipt representing such ADSs to such holder
promptly in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. If payment of the
Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional ADSs as
provided in  _Section 2.2(e)_ and any unpaid dividends and other
distributions with respect to such ADSs as provided in _Section 2.2(c)_) is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so transferred is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company or the systems of DTC, as the case may be,
it will be a condition of payment that (1) the Company Certificate so
surrendered or the Book-Entry Shares so transferred will be endorsed properly
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (2) the person requesting
such payment (x) will have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so
transferred or (y) will have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Company and the Exchange Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(b)_, each Company Certificate and each Book-Entry Share will be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration that the
holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Company
Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this ___Article II_ and certain
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section
2.2(c)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration
or unpaid dividends and other distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
___Article II_.

  



  

(c) _Dividends; Other Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to ADSs or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that have not been surrendered or
transferred with respect to the ADSs represented thereby and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional ADSs will be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in
lieu of fractional ADSs will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will
be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender or transfer
of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
___Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws,
following surrender or transfer of any such Company Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance herewith, (A) there will be paid to the holder of
whole ADSs issued in exchange therefor, without interest, in addition to all
other amounts to which such holder is entitled under this ___Article II_ ,
(i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole ADSs or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares
and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional ADS to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or transfer and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender or transfer payable with
respect to such whole ADSs or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares and (B)
Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Company to pay all dividends or other
distributions, in each case with a record date prior to the Effective Time,
that have been declared or made by the Company with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but that
have not been paid on such shares.

  



  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All ADSs
issued and all Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender or transfer for
exchange of Company Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this ___Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_ and _Section 2.2(e)_) will be deemed to have been issued or paid,
as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company
Certificates and such Book-Entry Shares, and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

presented to Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
___Article II_.

  



  

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

  



  

(i) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional ADSs
shall be issued upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of
Parent will relate to such fractional ADS interests and such fractional ADS
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
shareholder of Parent.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of an ADS (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, from the Exchange Agent, a cash
payment in United States dollars in lieu of such fractional ADS interest
either (A) representing that holder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of
the aggregate of the fractional ADSs which would otherwise have been
issued under this ___Article II_ (the " _Excess ADSs_ ") or (B) cash in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)(iii)_ below. The sale of the Excess ADSs
shall be (A) executed on The NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock
Exchange, as applicable, and (B) made at such times, in such manner and on
such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable
discretion. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_, the Exchange Agent shall hold the net
proceeds in trust (the " _Exchange Trust_ ") for those holders. All
commissions, fees, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with the sale of the Excess ADSs shall be paid by Parent and the
Surviving Company. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Certificates and Book Entry
Shares in lieu of fractional ADSs, the Exchange Agent shall make that amount
available to those holders, without interest. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the net proceeds to which each holder of Company
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled by multiplying the
aggregate amount of the net proceeds by a fraction of which (1) the numerator
is the amount of the fractional ADS interest to which such holder of Company
Certificates or Book Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Company Certificates delivered by such holder) and (2) the denominator is the
aggregate amount of fractional ADSs interests to which all holders of Company
Certificates and Book Entry Shares are entitled.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.2(e)(ii)_, Parent
may elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash in United States dollars, to be deposited
promptly following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange Agent to
pay each holder of Company Certificates or Book Entry Shares an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction of an ADS
to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B) the closing
price for an ADS on The NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Exchange, as applicable, on the first Business Day immediately following the
Effective Time. In such event, all references in this Agreement to the net
proceeds from the sale of the Excess ADSs and similar references shall be
deemed to refer to the payments calculated in the manner set forth in this
_Section 2.2(e)(iii)_.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust_. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund or the Exchange Trust that remains undistributed to
the holders of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year
after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this ___Article II_ may thereafter look only to Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions, if any, with respect to ADSs. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any
ADSs or the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares, any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional ADSs or any cash from
the Exchange Fund or Exchange Trust, in each case, delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  



  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust_. The Exchange
Agent will invest any cash in the Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
will in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $25 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid to Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund and
Exchange Trust is insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this
___Article II_ , Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Company, promptly
to deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange
Fund and Exchange Trust will not be used for any purpose not
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such customary and reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and,
if applicable, any unpaid dividends and

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

distributions on ADSs deliverable in respect thereof, due to such person
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in
the outstanding shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company
or Parent shall occur as a result of any merger, business combination,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio, and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to provide the holders of Company Common Stock (or such
rights that are convertible into shares of Company Common Stock) the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.3_ shall be construed to permit
either the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its respective
securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this
Agreement.

  



  

2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.1(c)_, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) and held
by a record holder or beneficial owner who has not voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is
statutorily entitled to exercise appraisal rights and who duly complies with
all provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and seek appraisal
of their shares of Company Common Stock (such shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's dissenters' rights under
the DGCL with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock) will not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead will
be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock will be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, without interest
thereon and less any required withholding taxes, upon surrender or transfer of
such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such
shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section
2.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
2.1(c)_, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned prior to the Effective Time,
then the right of any stockholder of the Company to be paid the fair value of
such holder's Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be
null and void. The Company will provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent will have the
opportunity and right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent
or to the extent required by

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Law, the Company will not make any payment with respect to, or settle or
agree or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

2.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Company, Parent
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. The Surviving
Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall pay, or shall
cause to be paid, all amounts so withheld to the appropriate taxing authority
within the period required under applicable Tax Law. In the case of
any proposed withholding under Section 1445 of the Code, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Company written notice of
such proposed withholding at least 14 Business Days prior to the Closing in
order to allow the Company to deliver to Parent appropriate certifications
exempting payment of the Merger Consideration from withholding under Section
1445 of the Code.

3.3 _Corporate Authority; Approvals; Fairness Opinion_.

  



  

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority and
has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and,
subject to the Company Stockholder Approval, perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  



  

(b) The Company Board has unanimously, by resolutions duly adopted:

  



  

(i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and are fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company;

  



  

(ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

  



  

(iii) subject to the terms hereof, including _Section 5.4_,
recommended to the Company Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement (the
foregoing recommendations in clauses (i) through (iii) of this  _Section
3.3(b)_, collectively, the " _Company Recommendation_ "),

  



  

which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn, except
after the date of this Agreement as permitted by this Agreement, including
_Section 5.4_. Except for the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) The Company Board has received the opinion of Qatalyst Partners
LP (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of Company Common Stock, other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent,
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such holders from a financial point of
view, and as promptly as practicable a copy of such opinion will be provided
by the Company to Parent, solely for informational purposes, following the
date of this Agreement.

  



  

3.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

  



  

(a) Except for (i) compliance with, and filings under, the Hart-

a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) give any Person the right to accelerate
the maturity or performance of any Parent Material Contract or (iii) give any
Person the right to cancel, terminate for cause or modify any Parent Material

8-A, at the time the Form F-4, Form F-6 and Form 8-A, as applicable, becomes
effective under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, or at
the Effective Time, (ii) in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Parent

Company Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or

the Parent Shareholders or at the time of the Parent Shareholders Meeting,
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the
Parent Shareholder Circular will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of applicable Law, except that no representation or

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who is entitled to any fee or
any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.21 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete
and fully executed copies of commitment letters from Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., together with the executed fee letter related thereto of even
date herewith (which such fee letter may be redacted so long as no redaction
covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate amount, conditionality,
availability or termination of the debt financing contemplated therein) and
any related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other
agreements, which provide such lenders' respective commitments to provide
Parent with debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby in the amount set forth therein (collectively, the " _Commitment
Letters_ ") (such debt financing, the " _Financing_ "). Each of the
Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date
hereof, none of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified, and the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified (and no such withdrawal, rescission
or modification is contemplated). As of the date hereof, there are no side
letters or other arrangements relating to the Commitment Letters (other than
the fee letter provided to the Company under this _Section 4.21_). As of the
date hereof, Parent has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all
commitment fees or other fees that have been incurred and are due and
required to be paid as of the date hereof in connection with the Commitment
Letters. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters, or
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be
unavailable. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth
in the Commitment Letters in the form so delivered to the Company. As of the
date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any term or condition to
the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters will not be fully satisfied
on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent at the
Closing. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing, together with the cash or
other sources of immediately available funds that Parent has or will have
prior to the Closing, are in an amount sufficient to enable it to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, to refinance any
indebtedness required to be refinanced in connection therewith and to pay any
related fees and expenses. Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and
agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Closing,
are not subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of the Financing or any
alternative financing.

  



  

4.22 _Interested Stockholder_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates (a) beneficially owns any shares of Company Common
Stock, (b) has any plans or arrangements relating to the voting or ownership
of shares with any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, (c) has been, is
or will be, including following the consummation of the Merger, an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, or (d) has taken, or
authorized or permitted to be taken, any action that would reasonably be
expected to cause any of them to be deemed to be such an interested
stockholder.

Articles required in order to permit the issuance of the ADRs and ADSs in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement by holders of 75% or more of the
outstanding shares of Parent Ordinary Shares entitled to vote at the Parent
Shareholders Meeting and present and voting thereat are the only votes of the
holders of any class or series of Parent's capital stock necessary to
approve or adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Parent Shareholder Approval_ ").

in, a Company Acquisition Proposal (for avoidance of doubt, it
being understood that the foregoing will not prohibit the Company or the
Company's Representatives from making such Person aware of the restrictions
of this _Section 5.4_ in response to the receipt of a Company Acquisition
Proposal), (iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or agreement in principle or any other agreement (other than
an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal

(an " _Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) authorize,
adopt, approve or recommend or publicly propose to authorize, adopt, approve
or recommend to the Company Stockholders, or submit to the Company
Stockholders for a vote at any stockholder meeting, any Company
Acquisition Proposal. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease
any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.4(a)_, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if
the Company receives a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal from any
Person that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.4(a)_, the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may
provide information (including non-public information and data) regarding, and
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and
personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company
receives from such Person (or has received from such Person) an executed
Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement, provided that the Company will
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) make available to the Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made
available to the Parent and (ii) the Company and its Representatives may
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to such Company Acquisition
Proposal, as long as (A) the Company has not materially breached _Section 
5.4(a)_ with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) prior to
taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
determines in good faith that (1) such Company Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to participate in
such discussions or negotiations or furnish such information would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  



  

(c) During the No-Shop Period, the Company will promptly after
knowledge by the Company of receipt (and in any event within 24 hours
after knowledge of receipt), notify Parent both orally and in writing of the
receipt by the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed with,
either the Company or its Representatives concerning a Company Acquisition
Proposal, which notice will include a written summary of the material terms of
any Company Acquisition Proposal not made in writing or any such inquiry or
request and provide a copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal (if made
in writing). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of receipt) of any
material developments regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4(d)_, the Company Board
will not (i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent (or publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C) publicly
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
Company Stockholders, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (D) if (1) a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes a

  



    

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company Acquisition Proposal is commenced or (2) a Company Acquisition
Proposal is otherwise publicly announced, fail to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders or against
such Company Acquisition Proposal within 10 Business Days after
commencement or announcement thereof (any of the foregoing, a " _Company
Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve or publicly
propose to authorize, adopt or approve or recommend, or enter into, any
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement (x) constituting or relating to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or (y) requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may (I) without excluding the
Company Board's right to act in accordance with clause (II), effect a Company
Change of Recommendation that does not relate to a Company Acquisition
Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, as a result of an event, development or
change in circumstances that occurs or arises after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (other than a Company Acquisition Proposal) that
was not known (or the consequences of which were not known) to the Company
Board prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (a " _Company
Intervening Event_ "), the failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (II) without excluding
the Company Board's right to act in accordance with clause (I), effect a
Company Change of Recommendation if the Company receives a
Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) that the
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that
the failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may take the
actions described in (1) clause (II) only if the Company (A) has
not materially breached _Section 5.4(a)_, _Section 5.4(b)_ or _Section
5.4(c)_ with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ concurrently with entering into
such Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement and pays the Company
Termination Fee in compliance with _Section 7.5(b)_ and (2) clauses (I) or
(II) if:

  



  

(y) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent (which
notice itself will not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation) of its
or the Company Board's intention to take such actions at least four Business
Days in advance of taking such action, which notice will specify, as
applicable, the material circumstances of such Company Intervening Event or
the information and documents required to be furnished pursuant to _Section
5.4(c)_; and

  



  

(z) the Company Board has considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by, and
would be legally binding upon, Parent by 5:00 PM California time on the fourth
Business Day after the Company has provided the notice described in the
preceding clause (y) and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect
to the actions described in clause (II), after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, that the Company Acquisition Proposal
received by the Company continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause (I), after
consultation with outside counsel, that it would continue to reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors'

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Company Change of
Recommendation, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent in
a definitive agreement were given effect. In the event of any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material revisions to the Company Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent pursuant to the preceding clause (y) and to comply with the
requirements of this clause (z) with respect to such new written notice,
except the notice period shall be at least two Business Days (rather than the
four Business Days contemplated by clause (y) and this clause (z)).

  



  

(e) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 5.4(e)_, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.4_ will be deemed to prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking such actions as the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel are required to comply
with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard
to a Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Intervening Event, including
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position required or
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) publishing any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communications to the Company Stockholders), with any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication not being deemed to be a Company Change
of Recommendation; provided that neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof will effect a Company Change of Recommendation unless the applicable
requirements of  _Section 5.4(d)_ have been satisfied.

  



  

5.5 _Parent Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) During the No-Shop Period, Parent and its Subsidiaries will not,
and Parent will not authorize, direct or knowingly permit its
Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to, or provide any non-public information or data concerning
Parent or its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (for avoidance of doubt, it being understood that the
foregoing will not prohibit Parent or Parent's Representatives from making
such Person aware of the restrictions of this _Section 5.5_ in response to
the receipt of a Parent Acquisition Proposal), (iii) enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, or
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle or
any other agreement (other than an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Parent Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) authorize, adopt, approve or
recommend or publicly propose to authorize, adopt, approve or recommend to
the Parent Shareholders, or submit to the Parent Shareholders for a vote at
any shareholder meeting, any Parent Acquisition Proposal, provided that
nothing in this _Section 5.5(a)_ shall require Parent to take any action, or
prevent Parent from taking any action, which the UK Takeover Panel determines
is inconsistent with or in breach of Parent's obligations under the UK City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the " _UK Code_ ") or which would prevent
Parent from complying with its obligations under the UK Code. To the extent
that Parent believes (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that
this _Section 5.5(a)_ would require Parent to take any action, or prevent
Parent from taking any

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

action, which the UK Takeover Panel would likely determine to be inconsistent
with or in breach of Parent's obligations under the UK Code, Parent shall
notify the Company of the same not less than four Business days before taking
the action in question, consult in good faith with the Company and give the
Company the reasonable opportunity to make submissions to the UK Takeover
Panel (including providing the Company with all information reasonably
requested by the Company to make such submission) before such panel makes its
ruling. To the extent applicable, immediately after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, cease any discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) During the No-Shop Period, Parent will promptly after knowledge
by Parent of receipt (and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of
receipt), notify the Company both orally and in writing of the receipt by
Parent of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed with, either
Parent or its Representatives concerning a Parent Acquisition Proposal, which
notice will include a written summary of the material terms of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal not made in writing or any such inquiry or request and
provide a copy of such Parent Acquisition Proposal (if made in
writing). Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a prompt basis
(and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of receipt) of any material
developments regarding any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.5(c)_, the Parent
Board will not (i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to the Company (or publicly propose or resolve to change,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), the Parent Recommendation, (B) fail to
include the Parent Recommendation in the shareholder circular relating to the
Parent Shareholder Meeting (the " _Parent Shareholder Circular_ "),
(C) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend to the Parent Shareholders, a Parent Acquisition Proposal or (D)
within 10 Business Days after the commencement or announcement of a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, fail to recommend against acceptance of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing, a " _Parent Change of
Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve or publicly propose to
authorize, adopt or approve, or enter into, any Alternative Parent
Acquisition Agreement (x) constituting or relating to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal or (y) requiring Parent to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Without
prejudice to Parent's obligations under _Section 5.5(a)_ and _Section 5.5(b)_
and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the
Parent Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a
Parent Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board may only effect a Parent
Change of Recommendation if:

  



  

(y) Parent has not materially breached _Section 5.5(a)_ or _Section
5.5(b)_ with respect to the facts or circumstances underlying such Parent
Change of Recommendation and Parent has provided prior written notice to the
Company (which notice itself will not constitute a Parent Change of
Recommendation) of the Parent Board's intention to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation at least four Business Days in advance of taking

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

such action, which notice will specify the material circumstances giving rise
to the Parent Board's determination to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation; and

  



  

(z) the Parent Board has considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by, and
would be legally binding upon, the Company by 5:00 PM California time on the
fourth Business Day after Parent has provided the notice described in the
preceding clause (y) and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it would continue to reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law not to effect the Parent Change of Recommendation if such
changes offered in writing by the Company in a definitive agreement were
given effect. If any of the circumstances giving rise to the Parent Board's
determination to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation change in any
material respect, Parent shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
the Company pursuant to the preceding clause (y) and to comply with the
requirements of this clause (z) with respect to such new written notice,
except the notice period shall be at least two Business Days (rather than the
four Business Days contemplated by clause (y) and this clause (z)).

  



  

(d) Subject to the provision in this Section 5.5(d), nothing in this
Section 5.5 will be deemed to prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from taking
such actions as Parent determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel are required to comply with its disclosure obligations
under applicable Law; provided that neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof will effect a Parent Change of Recommendation unless the applicable
requirements of _Section 5.5(c)_ have been satisfied.

  



  

5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use (and cause its
Affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance
with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties and all consents, approvals and waivers from
third parties reasonably requested by Parent or the Company to be obtained in
respect of the Company Material Contracts or the Parent Material Contracts,
as applicable, in connection with the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that the
failure to receive any such consents, approvals or waivers will not be a
condition to the obligations of the parties hereunder), (iii) the defending
of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ ,

  



    

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

 _however_ , that in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Contract or to incur any material cost or expense in the performance hereof
and that in no event will Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract or to
incur any material cost or expense in the performance hereof.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent will (i)
promptly, and using their respective reasonable best efforts to make such
initial filing by the dates set forth on _Section 5.6(b)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule for the jurisdictions listed therein, make their
respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under
the HSR Act and any other applicable foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) except in
connection with a disclosure by the Company regarding a Company Change of
Recommendation or a Company Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or in
connection with a disclosure by Parent regarding a Parent Change of
Recommendation or a Parent Acquisition Proposal received by Parent,
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking
all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) promptly
inform the other party upon receipt of any material communication from the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger. Except in connection with a disclosure by the Company
regarding a Company Change of Recommendation or a Company Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company or in connection with a disclosure by Parent
regarding a Parent Change of Recommendation or a Parent Acquisition Proposal
received by Parent, the Company and Parent will permit counsel for the
other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed material
written communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees not to (A) participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent practicable and not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate, (B) extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the
prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (C) enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



    

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent will cooperate in all respects with each other and will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than
_Section  5.6(d)_), however, in no event shall Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to commit to any actions, and,
without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall consent to or take any actions, including to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, businesses or interest or agree
to conditions relating to or changes in the conduct of its business,
that would reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent (including
anticipated synergies) of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
an amount that is financially material relative to the value of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.6_ will limit a
party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2_ so long
as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations
under this _Section 5.6_.

  



  

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
CFIUS Approval. Such efforts shall include engaging in prefiling discussions
with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (" _CFIUS_ ") or
its member agencies, as deemed advisable by the parties; promptly preparing
the Exon-Florio Filing and making any draft and final filings required or
deemed advisable in connection with the CFIUS Approval, and providing, within
the time period imposed by CFIUS, any information reasonably requested by
CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, as soon as
practicable, deliver the initial draft of the Exon-Florio Filing to CFIUS and
agree to abide by _Section 5.6(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedules and
Company Disclosure Schedules, respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, however, in no event shall Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to commit to any actions,
and, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall consent to or take any actions, including to sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, businesses or interest or
agree to conditions relating to or changes in the conduct of its business,
that would reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent
(including anticipated synergies) of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount that is financially material relative to the value of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole.

  



  

5.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly advise the other parties to this Agreement orally and in
writing to the extent it has knowledge of any change or event having a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or any change or event reasonably likely to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of Parent, or a Company Material
Adverse Effect or

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any change or event reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in the case of the Company, or the ability of the conditions set
forth in ___Article VI_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification or failure to deliver such notification will affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.

  



  

5.8 _Preparation of the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Preparation of Parent Shareholder Circular and Parent Prospectus;
Stockholders Meetings_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the
SEC (and each shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to
occur within 60 days of the date of this Agreement) the proxy
statement/prospectus (as part of the Form F-4) that includes (A) a prospectus
for the issuance of ADSs (and the Parent Ordinary Shares represented thereby)
in the Merger and (B) a proxy statement of the Company for use in the
solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement/prospectus, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Form F-4, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as
a prospectus, (iii) Parent shall prepare and file a registration statement on
Form 8-A (" _Form 8-A_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Exchange Act of the ADSs to be issued to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Merger and the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares and (iv)
Parent shall prepare and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Depositary
Bank to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-6 relating
to the registration under the Securities Act of the issuance of the ADSs (the
" _Form F-6_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts (i) to cause the Form F-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply
with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (ii) to
promptly notify the other of, cooperate with each other with respect to, and
respond promptly, to any comments of the SEC or its staff, (iii) to have the
Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and (iv) to keep the Form F-4 effective through
the Closing in order to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Form F-6 and the Form 8-A to comply with the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and to become effective under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, as promptly as
practicable after they are filed with the SEC. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent and the Company will
promptly provide all information concerning such entity to the other, and
provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form F-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including that the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements required to be included in
the Form F-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a reconciliation to IFRS of its
financial statements in a form that is adequate for the preparation of such
financial statements within 45 days of the date of this Agreement). No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4, the Form F-6 or the Form 8-A
will be made by Parent or the Depositary Bank, as applicable, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made
by the Company or Parent, in each case, without

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

providing the other party and its respective counsel the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to such
comments. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and to the
extent permitted under _Section 5.4(d)_, the Company may amend or supplement
(and Parent will, at the Company's request, amend or supplement) the Form F-4
or Proxy Statement/Prospectus to effect a Company Change of Recommendation.
Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" laws that are required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall notify each other promptly
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form F-4, the Form F-6 or the Form 8-A or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form F-4, the Form F-6, the Form 8-A or the Merger.
Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form F-4, the Form F-6 or the Form 8-A has become effective
or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the ADSs issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction and Parent
and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to have any stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any
of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and their permitted successors and
assigns, to honor and perform all employment or compensatory Contracts
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Company Employee, on the other (including all retention awards and employment,
employment continuation, severance, incentive, change in control and
termination Contracts disclosed in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Assumed Equity Awards (as defined in _Section

continues employment with Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Affected Employee_ "), while employed by Parent or any of its
direct or indirect Subsidiaries, compensation and benefits the value of which
is comparable in the aggregate to the aggregate value of the compensation and
benefits provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding the value of any defined benefit pension plan and
the Company ESPP). During the Transition Period, (i) each Affected Employee,
while employed by the Parent or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, will be provided base wages or salary, as applicable, that are
not less than the base wages or salary, as applicable, provided to such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) each
Affected Employee will be provided severance benefits not less favorable in
amount or with regard to terms and conditions to receive such severance
benefits than those disclosed in  _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure

employee benefit plans in which the Affected Employees are entitled to
participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level
of benefits and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual purposes under
any defined benefit pension plan, unless required by Law) thereunder, service
for the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to
the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent it would result in
a duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of
service), and Affected Employees will be immediately eligible to participate
in any such plans, without any waiting period, to the extent such Affected
Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Company plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any health benefit plan
replaces a Company Benefit Plan that is a health benefit plan during the
Transition Period, Parent will, and will cause its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting condition exclusions and all waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected
Employee to the extent waived or satisfied under the replaced Company Benefit
Plan and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any applicable amounts
(whether in the nature of

  



    

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts applied toward deductibles or
other out-of-pocket expenses) under the terms of the replaced Company Benefit
Plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements under the health benefit plan that replaces such a Company
Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the transition between plans occurs.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.11_ or any other

Parent or their Affiliates, (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit, compensation or
severance plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement that is
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates,
provided any such amendment, modification or termination must comply with the
terms thereof and applicable Law, (iii) will create any third-party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any Affected
Employee) other than the parties to this Agreement, or (iv) will limit the
right of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) to terminate, in accordance with
applicable Law, the employment or service of any employee or other service
provider during the Transition Period.

  



  

(e) If requested by Parent at least 10 days prior to the Closing,
then effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing,
the Company will terminate each of the Company Benefit Plans intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, in which case
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Dialog
Semiconductor, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust prior to Closing, to
accept, on or after Closing, the rollover by Transferred Employees of any
"eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of

loans, in accordance with applicable Code provisions.

of six years following the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses as

applicable Law, each current and former director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who, as of the date of this Agreement, is entitled to
be indemnified under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Party's service as a director, officer or representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons at
the request of the

  



    

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (x) the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the process and other events
giving rise thereto, and (y) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event
of any such action, Parent and the Surviving Company will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Company to, cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such action.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the provisions in its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to the extent they provide for
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, on the same basis as set forth
in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by applicable
Law, which provisions will not be amended except as required by applicable
Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the
scope of the Indemnified Parties' indemnification rights thereunder.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully
pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies for the Indemnified Parties (and
such other persons who may be insureds under such policies) and (ii) the
Company's existing fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's insurance carrier as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary and employment practices liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits, terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable
to the Indemnified Parties (and such other persons who may be insureds under
such policies) as the Company's existing policies with respect to any matters
that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). Whether pursuant to such tail policy or otherwise, the Surviving
Company will continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time DandO Insurance with benefits, terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date
of this Agreement, or the Surviving Company will use reasonable best efforts
to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits,
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as
favorable to the insureds as provided in the Company's existing policies as
of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will
the Surviving Company be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Company will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(d) If the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or
entity and is not the continuing or

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, unless provided by
operation of Law, proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Company will assume all of the obligations set forth
in this ___Section 5.13_. This _Section 5.13_ may not be amended after
the Effective Time in a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party
unless such Indemnified Party will have consented in writing to such
amendment.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.13_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
who are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.13_ as of and
following the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section
5.13_ will be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have
under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or comparable governing documents

or Laws. For a period of six years following the Effective Time, all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party
as provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or comparable governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will survive the Merger and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

  



  

5.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board each will use reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

5.16 _Parent Vote_. Parent will vote (or consent, by written action in
lieu of a meeting, with respect to) all voting stock of Merger Sub and all
Company Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by Parent or Parent's
Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the
Company and the consummation by Merger Sub and the Company of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.17 _Company Stock Options; Company Stock-Based Awards; Company
Units; Company ESPP_.

  



  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At least 16 days prior to the
Effective Time (such period through the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time, the " _Option Notice Period_ "), the Company shall provide
written notice to each holder of a then-outstanding option to purchase
Shares, whether vested or unvested (a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether
granted under the Atmel Corporation 2005 Stock Plan, the Newport Media, Inc.
2005 Stock Incentive Plan and RSU Sub-Plan or the Ozmo, Inc. 2005
Equity Incentive Plan (together, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), that such
Company Stock Option will, contingent on the occurrence of the Effective
Time, accelerate and become vested and exercisable in full as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and such holder will have the right to exercise
his or her Company Stock Option during the Option Notice Period. To the
extent not exercised prior by the conclusion of the Option Notice Period,
each Company Stock Option will be automatically "net-exercised" immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with the exercise price and applicable
withholding taxes paid by the withholding of Shares otherwise issuable to
such holder upon the exercise of the Company Stock Option. Upon such exercise,
the former holder of the Company Stock Option will be issued the net number
of shares resulting from the "net exercise", and such stockholder will
thereafter be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
these Shares as provided in ___Article II_.

  



  

(b) _Company Units_. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
and unvested restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, performance-
based restricted stock unit or similar right held by an individual who will
continue in service at the Effective Time, in each case representing a right
to receive one Share, whether or not granted under the Company Stock Plans (a
" _Company Unit_ "), including each "performance share award" denominated in
Company Units, will be assumed by Parent (such Company Unit, an "
_Assumed Unit_ ") and converted into the right to receive, if as and when the
Assumed Unit would otherwise have vested (taking into account, and without
modification, any acceleration of vesting under the applicable award agreement
or other Contract with the award holder), that number of ADSs equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Assumed Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Equity Award ADS Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
ADS. Any Company Unit that is vested at the Effective Time (taking into
account any acceleration of vesting under the applicable award agreement or
other Contract with the award holder), but as to which the underlying Share
has not been issued by the Effective Time, will be issued as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and will be treated as outstanding Company Common
Stock for purposes of _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_, and shall receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Article II_ , subject to applicable
tax withholding.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 5.17(b)_, to the extent
that Parent determines that the assumption and conversion of a Company Unit
as provided in _Section 5.17(b)_ would violate, in respect of the holder
thereof, the applicable Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction set forth on _Section
5.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent may treat such Company
Unit in a manner other than as prescribed by _Section 5.17(b)_, so long as
the holder of such Company Unit receives the full value of the Merger
Consideration (less applicable tax withholdings) in cash not later than
vesting date originally applicable to such Company Unit (such Company Unit,
together with the Assumed Units, the " _Assumed Equity Awards_ ").

  



    

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to (i) terminate the Atmel Corporation 2010
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) provide that any "Offering Period" (as defined in
the Company ESPP) in progress on the Closing Date will be shortened in
accordance with Section 19(c) of the Company ESPP, and the last day of each
such Offering Period shall be the 10th Business Day prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Final Purchase Date_ "), with purchases made on the Final Purchase
Date contingent upon the Closing, and (iii) avoid the commencement of any new
Offering Period under the Company ESPP at or after the Final Purchase
Date and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time. Any Shares acquired under the Company ESPP prior to or on the
Final Purchase Date will be treated as outstanding Shares for purposes of
_Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event later than 10 Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form F-8, Form F-3
or another appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to ADSs issuable with respect to all Assumed
Equity Awards, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such Assumed Equity
Awards remain outstanding. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
actions reasonably necessary so that Parent may assume, grant and convert the
Assumed Equity Awards at the Effective Time in compliance with applicable
Laws and the Parent Articles. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the ADSs issuable in accordance
with _Section 5.17_ of this Agreement to be admitted for trading on the FSE
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) Parent shall cause the assumption of the Assumed Equity Awards
to occur in a manner so as to remain exempt from or comply with Section 409A
of the Code, and this _Section 5.17_ shall be construed consistent with such
intent. Each payment with respect to an Assumed Equity Award as to which
payments will be made in installments is and will be treated as a separate
payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company (and the
Company Board and any applicable committees thereof) and Parent (and the
Parent Board and any applicable committees thereof) will take all actions and
adopt such resolutions as may be required to give effect to and accomplish
the transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.17_.

Company will provide, within 10 days after the date hereof, as of the
most recent reasonably practicable date, a complete and correct list of each
outstanding Company Stock Option or Company Unit, including the employee
identification number of the grantee, the date of grant, the date of
expiration, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award as of such date, the exercise price, the vesting schedule and the number

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way
limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable.

  



  

5.21 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds
of the Financing (including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any
flex provisions) at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable
best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its
obligations under the Commitment Letters, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, but in no event later than the Closing, or on such other terms and
conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than
the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (provided that
such other terms would not reasonably be expected to delay or hinder the
Closing), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters (or definitive agreements entered
into with respect to the Commitment Letters), (v) prepare the information
memoranda, preliminary and final offering memoranda or prospectuses,
registration statements and other materials to be used in connection with
obtaining the Financing prior to the anticipated date on which all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived, to the
extent reasonably practicable, and (vi) in the event that all conditions in
the Commitment Letters have been satisfied, cause the Financing Sources and
any other Persons providing financing to fund the Financing at the Closing.
Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Commitment Letters as and
when they become due to the extent they are required to be paid pursuant to
the terms of the Commitment Letters.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters without the
consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing to be funded on the Closing Date
unless Parent may draw upon an available revolver to fund an amount equal to
such reduction and the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.21_ remains true and correct, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
other terms to the Financing, or otherwise expand any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that could reasonably be expected to
delay, impede or prevent the timely funding of the Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, or (iii) adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Financing
Sources, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend,
amend and restate or replace the existing Commitment Letters solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section  5.21_, during the three week
period commencing on the date hereof, one or more Commitment Letters may be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the
option of

  



    

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Parent by instruments that either amend, amend and restate, or replace the
existing Commitment Letters on economic terms more favorable to Parent than
the terms under the existing Commitment Letters; _provided_ that the terms of
the such new or amended commitment letters shall conform to the provisions of
_Schedule 5.21(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and shall not (i) impose
new or additional conditions to the availability of the Financing at the
Closing or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, (ii) impose any other terms to the Financing that could reasonably
be expected to delay, impede or prevent the timely funding of the Financing,
or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, or (iii)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Financing Sources. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of any amendments, restatements, supplements, amendment and
restatements, modifications or replacements to the Commitment Letters and
(ii) give the Company prompt notice of any breach by any party of any of the
Commitment Letters of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any
termination thereof; provided that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (i) or
(ii) that would waive the protection of attorney-client or similar privilege
if such party shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. " _Financing
Sources_ " means the Persons that have committed to provide or arrange or
otherwise entered or will enter into agreements with Parent (including the
Commitment Letters) in connection with the Financing or any other financing
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including the parties
named in _Section 4.21_, and the parties to any joinder agreements,
indentures or credit agreements entered pursuant thereto or relating thereto,
together with their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, direct or indirect stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, successors and
assigns and any former, current or future general or limited partner, direct
or indirect stockholder, manager, member, Affiliate, officer, director,
employee, agent, representative, successor or assign of any of the foregoing.

  



  

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment
Letters (including the flex provisions) and such portion is required to
consummate the Merger, (1) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (2)
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain any such portion from alternative sources on terms, taken as whole,
that are no more adverse to Parent and the Company (including after giving
effect to the flex provisions) as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section
5.21_, in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including
the flex provisions) and such portion is required to consummate the Merger,
one or more Commitment Letters may be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Parent after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments that either
amend, amend and restate, or replace the existing Commitment Letters or
contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other or
additional parties; provided that the terms of the such new or
amended commitment letters shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing to be funded on the Closing Date unless Parent may draw upon an
available revolver to fund an amount equal to such reduction and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section  4.21_ remains true and
correct, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the
Financing, or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in a manner

  



    

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

that could reasonably be expected to delay, impede or prevent the timely
funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the Financing Sources. Parent shall promptly notify the
Company of its intention to make any such amendment or obtain such
alternative financing described in this _Section 5.21(c)_ and keep the
Company reasonably informed of the terms thereof. Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and correct copies of all new or amended commitment letters
(including redacted fee and engagement letters in respect of any new or
amended commitment letters). In such event, the term "Commitment Letters" as
used herein shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letters that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the new or amended commitment letters
described in this _Section 5.21(c)_ to the extent then in effect and the term
"Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to include the financing
contemplated by any such new or amended commitment letters.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to provide such cooperation in connection with any
financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger

the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon

letters to the underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as
applicable, in connection with any such financing; (ii) furnish Parent and
the Financing Sources with (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and

the Closing Date and unaudited statements of income and cash flows for the
period elapsed from the beginning of the applicable fiscal year to the end of
such fiscal quarter and, in each case, for the comparable periods of the
preceding fiscal year (with respect to which, in the case of the Company, the
independent auditors shall have performed an SAS 100, as amended by PCOAB
standards, review, although such independent auditors will not be preparing,
nor shall they be required to prepare, a written report concerning such SAS
100 review); provided that filing of the required financial statements on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q by the Company will satisfy the foregoing requirement;
(iii) furnish such additional customary and readily available financial
statements, schedules or other financial data relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably necessary and reasonably requested by
Parent in writing no more than 14 calendar days following the date of
this Agreement to consummate the Financing, (iv) provide direct contact

letters with respect to the Company's information in connection with bank
information memoranda; (vi) provide information, documents, authorization
letters and certificates, enter into agreements and take other actions that

permit Parent to fulfill conditions or obligations under the Commitment
Letters or in connection with the Financing (provided that such
agreements entered into shall be conditioned upon, and shall not take effect
until, the Effective Time); (vii) participate as necessary at reasonable
times and in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, customary one-on-
one sessions that are requested in advance and road shows with prospective
Financing Sources and in rating agency presentations, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions, as applicable (including the reasonable participation
in such meetings by the Company's senior management), in each case, in
connection with the Financing; (viii) reasonably assist Parent in the
preparation of any necessary pledge or security agreements, certificates or
other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging of, and
granting, recording and perfection of security interests in share
certificates, securities and other collateral, and obtaining surveys and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent; provided that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to enter into any such
agreement, certificate or document, pledge any collateral or grant any lien
or security interest or obtain a release of any existing lien or security
interest prior to the Effective Time; and (ix) provide to the Financing
Sources, at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are required by regulatory authorities under the applicable

including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and requested by
Parent or the Financing Sources at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing

(e) The Company shall (i) obtain customary payoff letters from
third-party lenders and trustees with respect to the Retired Company
Indebtedness and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such payoff letters to
Parent at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, subject to Parent making

Subsidiaries to, permanently (A) terminate the credit facilities of the
Company requested by Parent to be so terminated, if and to the extent such
facilities are specified by Parent to the Company no later than 15 Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, and all related contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the " _Retired
Company Indebtedness_ "), and (B) cause to be released any Liens on its
assets relating to such Retired Company Indebtedness.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 5.21_ or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement from Parent,
(ii) enter into any definitive agreement (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, the customary representation letters described in _Section
5.21(d)(v)_) that is effective prior to the Effective Time, (iii) give any
indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (iv) take any
action that could unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) provide
any information or take any action that will conflict with or violate its
organizational documents or any applicable legal requirement or would
result in a violation or

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

breach of, or default under, any material Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or would result in the waiver of a legal
privilege. In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
relating to the Financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any
action pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing) contemplated by this _Section 5.21_ that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Agreement will require (A) any officer
or Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to this _Section
5.21_ or any other provision of this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative or
(B) the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof to approve any
financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(g) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the
Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information (i) as is legally required to be disclosed in any offering
documents related to the Financing or (ii) to any Financing Sources or
prospective Financing Sources, ratings agencies and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Financing
and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection
with the Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and
auditors) so long as such Persons (A) agree to be bound by
the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement as if parties thereto and
(B) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings customary for
financings of the same type as the Financing.

  



  

(h) Parent (i) indemnifies, defends and holds harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any
loss, damages, claim, cost, liability, obligation or expense suffered or
incurred in connection with the Financing, any arrangement thereof and any
information provided in connection therewith except (A) historical information
relating thereto or other information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for use therein and (B) to the extent arising
from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) promptly, upon
request of the Company, reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 5.21_. The provisions of this _Section 5.21(h)_
survive termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(i) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Closing,
are not subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of the Financing or any
alternative financing.

  



  

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company's breach of any of its covenants required to be performed by it under
this  _Section 5.21_ will not be considered in determining the satisfaction
of the conditions in _Section 6.2(b)_ unless such breach is material and
directly results in Parent being unable to timely satisfy the conditions in
the

  



    

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Commitment Letters and as a result Parent is unable to obtain the proceeds of
the Financing at the Closing.

  



  

5.22 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to

5.24   _Establishment of ADR Facility; Stock Exchange Listings_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause a sponsored American depositary receipt ("
_ADR_ ") facility (the " _ADR Facility_ ") to be established with a reputable
national bank reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Depositary Bank_
") for the purpose of issuing the ADSs, including specifically and without
limitation entering into a customary deposit agreement (the " _Deposit
Agreement_ ") with the Depositary Bank establishing the ADR Facility, to be
effective as of the Effective Time, and filing with the SEC the Form F-6.
Parent shall consider in good faith the comments of the Company on the
Deposit Agreement, and the Deposit Agreement shall be subject to the approval
of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. In any event,
subject to the prior sentence and applicable Laws, the Deposit Agreement shall
(A) provide (i) that each ADS under the ADR Facility shall represent and be
exchangeable for one Parent Ordinary Share ranking _pari passu_ with all other
Parent Ordinary Shares in issue at Closing including in respect of any
entitlement to dividends or other distributions declared, paid or made after
Closing, (ii) for customary provisions for the voting by the Depositary Bank
of such Parent Ordinary Shares as instructed by the holders of the ADSs,
(iii) for the issuance, at the request of a holder, of either certificated or
uncertificated ADRs, (iv) subject to the limitations provided for in General
Instruction I.A.1 of SEC Form F-6, that holders of ADSs shall have the right

and (v) that the Parent Ordinary Shares deposited by Parent with the
custodian (the " _Custodian_ ") for the ADR Facility shall be held by the
Custodian for the benefit of the Depositary Bank, (B) require the Depositary
Bank to forward voting instructions and other shareholder communications
(including notices, reports and proxy solicitation materials) to the
registered holders of ADSs promptly following its receipt of such
materials, (C) include customary provisions for the distribution to holders
of ADSs of dividends, other distributions or the rights to participate in any
rights offerings in each case received by the Custodian from Parent (or in
certain cases the US dollars available to the Depositary from the net
proceeds of the sale of the foregoing), and (D) not permit (x) except as
required by applicable Law, any amendment that prejudices any substantial
right of ADS holders

  



    

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

without giving at least 30 days' notice to the holders of the outstanding
ADSs, or (y) any termination by Parent or the Depositary Bank on less than 30
days' written notice to ADS holders. The Deposit Agreement shall not provide
for (i) a right of Parent to withdraw Parent Ordinary Shares from the custody
account maintained by the Custodian or (ii) fees to be imposed by the
Depositary upon holders of ADSs in connection with the sale or transfer of
such ADSs on The NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange, as
applicable. The material terms of the Deposit Agreement and the ADSs shall be
described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Depositary Bank to issue a number of ADSs
sufficient to constitute the non-cash portion of the Merger
Consideration. The holders of ADSs shall not, and Parent shall, be liable for
any UK stamp duty reserve Tax or other transfer or similar Tax arising on the
issuance of the ADSs by the Depositary Bank in connection with the Merger.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the ADSs to be
eligible for settlement through the DTC. Parent and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to ensure that an original executed copy of
this Agreement is not brought into the United Kingdom, save where it is
necessary for such a copy to be brought into the United Kingdom for the
purposes of litigation.

  



  

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the ADSs
issuable to the Company Stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement to be
approved for listing on either, at Parent's sole election, The NASDAQ Stock
Market or the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of
issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent
Ordinary Shares underlying the ADSs to be issued to the Company
Stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement to be admitted for trading on
the FSE, subject only to allotment, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ and Euronext, as applicable, to enable and facilitate the delisting of
the Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and Euronext,
as applicable, by the Surviving Company as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

8.13 _Obligations of Subsidiaries_. Whenever this Agreement requires
