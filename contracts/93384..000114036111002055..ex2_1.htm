2.9(a), (2) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of

account all Shares then held by such holder), (3) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and (4) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.10(d), and the Certificates so

one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time (A) the amount of cash to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(a), (B) shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested by such holder of record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.9(a) (after taking into account all Shares then held by such holder), (C)
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and (D)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.10(d), and
the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.

  


 

  

(i) Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive
upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.10(d), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall have
surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following the
surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.10(d) and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  


 

  

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock under this Article II shall be paid (A)
at the time of payment of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under
Section 2.10(b)(ii), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a

amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent

to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  


 

  

(d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
all Certificates surrendered by such holder and all Book-Entry Shares formerly
held by such holder that are converted) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
Average Parent Stock Price.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Section 2.10. All cash
paid and shares of Parent Common Stock delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or the conversion of Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented thereby. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company, and if Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.

  


 

  

(f) Unregistered Transfer of Capital Stock. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and any other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

  


 

  

(g) Lost Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions to which holders
of such Certificates have become entitled in accordance with this Article II.

  


 

  

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid as directed by Parent. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is maintained at a
level sufficient to make all payments required under this Article II.

  


 

  

(i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former holders of Company Common Stock six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered as directed by Parent. Any such
holders who have not complied with this Article II prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent, and Parent shall thereafter be liable, for
payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of such
Certificates have become entitled (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws). Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as
shall be immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(j) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

Section 2.11. Equity Awards.

  


 

  

(a) Equity Plans. The Company shall take all actions necessary (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof and amending any Equity Compensation Plan) to
terminate, effective at the Effective Time each Equity Compensation Plan under
which no Assumed RSU has been granted.

  


 

  

(b) Stock Options. Each Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a "Current Option"), whether or not vested and
whether or not held by a Transferred Employee (each such Current Option, a
"Cancelled Stock Option") shall be cancelled and in lieu thereof, the holder
of each such Cancelled Stock Option will be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) the
amount obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the Average Parent Stock
Price over (B) the exercise price per Share under such Cancelled Stock Option
multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Cancelled Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest, reduced by any
income or employment taxes required to be withheld under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

  


 

  

(c) Restricted Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Restricted Share that is then outstanding (each, a "Current Restricted Share")
shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, vest in full
and, at the Effective Time, shall be treated as provided in Section 2.9(a).

  


 

  

(d) Restricted Stock Units. As of the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock
Unit that (i) is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Current RSU") and (ii) is held by a Non-Employee Director or is then vested
or vests in accordance with its terms upon (or immediately prior to) the
occurrence of the Effective Time (each such Current RSU, a "Cancelled RSU")
shall be cancelled and in lieu thereof, the holder of each such Cancelled RSU
will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) the
amount obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the Average Parent Stock
Price multiplied by (B) the number of Shares subject to such Cancelled RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest, reduced by any
income or employment taxes required to be withheld under the Code or other
Applicable Law. As of the Effective Time, each Current RSU that is not a
Cancelled RSU shall be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed RSU"). The number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each award of Assumed RSUs shall
be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each award of Current RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Equity Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded to the
nearest whole share). Each such award of Assumed RSUs otherwise shall, except
as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of such Assumed RSUs, be subject
to the same terms and conditions as applied to the related award of Current
RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule
applicable thereto.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) Amendment and Administration of Equity Arrangements. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company (and its board
of directors) shall take all requisite actions and/or adopt such resolutions
as may be required in order to give effect to and accomplish the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.11, including, without limitation, amending
each of the Equity Compensation Plans (i) if and to the extent necessary and
practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, the adjustment or cancellation of the Current
RSUs pursuant to Section 2.11(d) and the cancellation of the Cancelled Stock
Options, the vesting of the Current Restricted Shares pursuant to Section
2.11(b) and (c), respectively, and the substitution of Parent for the Company
under the Equity Compensation Plans to the extent appropriate to effectuate
the assumption of such Equity Compensation Plans by Parent and (ii) to
preclude (subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) any discretionary, automatic or formulaic grant of any Stock
Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or other equity-based
awards thereunder on or after the date hereof.

  


 

  

(f) Withholding Taxes. In accordance with this Section 2.11, the Surviving
Corporation will promptly pay or cause to be paid any amounts withheld
pursuant to this Section 2.11 for applicable foreign, federal, state and local
taxes to the appropriate Governmental Entity on behalf of such holders of the
applicable Cancelled Stock Options, Current Restricted Shares and/or
Restricted Stock Units.

  


 

  

(g) Assumption by Parent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the
obligations of the Company under the Equity Compensation Plans, each
outstanding Assumed RSU and the related Restricted Stock Unit grant agreements
evidencing Assumed RSUs. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Assumed RSUs appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the applicable Equity
Compensation Plan and applicable Restricted Stock Unit grant agreements and
indicating that the Restricted Stock Unit grant agreements evidencing the
grants of such Assumed RSUs shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to changes in accordance with this Section 2.11 and after
giving effect to the Merger). From and after the Effective Time, all
references to the Company (other than any references relating to a "Change in
Control" or "Fundamental Transaction") in each Equity Compensation Plan and in
each related grant agreement shall be deemed to refer to Parent, unless Parent
determines otherwise in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and
award.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(h) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board or the compensation committee of the Company
Board shall take all actions necessary, including adopting any necessary
resolutions to (A) terminate the Company's 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B) ensure that no
offering period shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (C)
if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in
existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new exercise
date to be set under the ESPP, which date shall be the Business Day
immediately prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (D) prohibit participants
in the ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from those in effect on
the date of this Agreement, and (E) provide that the amount of the accumulated
contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP (as amended pursuant to
this Section 2.11(h)), be refunded to such participant as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).

  


 

  

Section 2.12. Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded
and perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to receive such payment
from the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares as shall
be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or otherwise lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
each such Share held by such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.9(a), and such Share shall no longer be a
Dissenting Share. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
written demands received by the Company for appraisals of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL,
and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals of Shares, offer to settle or settle any
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  


 

  

Section 2.13. Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding Shares shall be
changed into a different number, class or series of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted or (b) the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Stock Consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 2.14. Withholding Taxes. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger any Taxes required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and properly paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned

date of such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC Report, including
any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. True and correct copies of all Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof have been furnished to Parent or are publicly available in the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC.
None of the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC. No executive officer of the Company has failed
in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section
302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with
respect to any Company SEC Report, and neither the Company nor any of its
executive officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity
challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications.

information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's

case, as currently in effect; (v) any notices to or from, or a description of
any oral communication with, the Internal Revenue Service or any office or

benefit pension plan except to the extent such International Employee Plan is
required to be maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
applicable Law or is listed in Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. With respect to each Employee Plan not set forth on Section 3.15 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, such Employee Plan either (i) may be
terminated at any time with no material Liability to the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) does not, and will not, result
in the aggregate in any material Liability to the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. The term "ERISA Affiliate" means any Person
that, together with the Company any of its Subsidiaries, would be deemed a

material compliance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, including the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. Each Employee Plan that is
intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to such
effect or still has a remaining period of time in which to apply for or
receive such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination and no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since
the date of such determination letter that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan or the ability
of such Employee Plan to obtain a favorable determination. With respect to
each International Employee Plan, all applicable foreign qualifications and/or
registration requirements have been satisfied in all material respects, except
where any failure to comply would not result in any material Liability to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) All material contributions, premiums and other payments required to be
made with respect to any Employee Plan have been made in all material respects

commitment to amend or establish any new material Employee Plan or to
materially increase any benefits under any Employee Plan.

  


 

  

(d) There are no material Legal Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened on behalf of or against any Employee Plan, the assets
of any trust under any Employee Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator
or any fiduciary or any Employee Plan with respect to the administration or
operation of such plans (excluding claims for benefits in the ordinary
course).

  


 

  

(e) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has,
with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would result in the imposition of a
material penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a material
tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan or for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.

retirement medical or other post-retirement welfare benefits to any Person,
except (1) to the extent required under any applicable Law or under Section
4980B of the Code, or (2) retirement or death benefits under any plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  


 

  

(g) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has (i) been maintained
and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A
of the Code and (ii) since January 1, 2009, to the Company's knowledge, has
been in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in
any such Employee Plan.

  


 

  

(h) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 2.11 of this Agreement, the
execution and delivery of, and performance of the transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events, whether contingent or otherwise): (i) result
in any material payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any Company Employee or director or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the forgiveness of any
material indebtedness of any such Company Employee, director or independent
contractor, (iii) materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such Company
Employee, director or independent contractor, or (iv) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such material
benefit or compensation.

  


 

  

(i) Through the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in
all material respects with their obligations pursuant to the 401(k) Settlement
Agreement.

obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides
for the gross-up of Taxes imposed by sections 280G, 4999 and/or 409A of the

years been in material compliance with all applicable Laws regarding
employment and employment practices and those Laws relating to terms and
conditions of employment, wages and hours, occupational safety and health and
workers' compensation, and (ii) has no material charges or complaints relating
to unfair labor practices or unlawful employment practices pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against it before any Governmental
Entity. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material Liability with respect to any misclassification
of any person as an independent contractor rather than as an "employee."

  


 

  

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, with respect to any current or
former employee of the Company: (i) has withheld and reported all material
amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld and reported with

received written notice of any material breach of or default under, any Lease,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with notice
or lapse of time or both would constitute such a breach or default thereunder

Subsidiaries in those countries where the Company and its Subsidiaries carry
on their businesses, except as has not had and would not reasonably be

complete and correct list of (i) all material agreements under which the

into any Company Products) and (ii) all agreements under which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has licensed to others the right to use any of the
material Company IP (other than standard, non-material, non-exclusive licenses
granted to customers in connection with the sale or distribution of Company
Products entered into in the ordinary course of business) (such agreements,
whether or not listed on Section 3.19(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the "Company IP Agreements"). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted any exclusive license of or exclusive right to, or authorized the

to the date of this Agreement, and there are no pending disputes, nor basis
for any dispute, regarding the scope of such Company IP Agreements,
performance under the Company IP Agreements, or with respect to payments made
or received under such Company IP Agreements.

  


 

  

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company IP is all of the Intellectual

ownership and other rights of any nature whatsoever (to the extent permitted
by law) of such Person in any such Intellectual Property developed for the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have and use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce a policy requiring (i) each
employee, consultant or independent contractor whose duties involve the
creation or contribution of Intellectual Property to execute an assignment
agreement containing terms assigning such Intellectual Property to the Company
and (ii) each employee, consultant or independent contractor to execute a
proprietary information and confidentiality agreement that contains non-
disclosure and other provisions protective of Trade Secrets, in each case
substantially in the form as those set forth in Section 3.19(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

jurisdiction. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened assertion, suit, action, investigation, proceeding or claim against
the Company or any Subsidiary, and there has been no such assertion, suit,
action, investigation, proceeding or claim against the Company or any
Subsidiary in the last three (3) years (or, to the knowledge of the Company,
in the last six (6) years), that the conduct and operations of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the manufacture and sale of the
Company Products, infringes upon, misappropriates, violates or conflicts in
any way with the Intellectual Property rights of any Person or constitutes
unfair competition or unfair trades practices under the Laws of any
jurisdiction, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been notified in
writing in the last three (3) years (or, to the knowledge of the Company, in
the last six (6) years) of any such assertion, suit, action, investigation,

extent any such matters have been resolved. To the knowledge of the Company,
there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures, infringements, or
misappropriations by any Person of any Owned Company IP, except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(h) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company threatened,
assertion or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of, or
contesting the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' rights with respect to,

The Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order that restricts
or impairs the use of any of Company IP or any Company Products, except as has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No compulsory licenses, licenses
of right or anything similar have been granted by a court of competent
jurisdiction in respect of the Owned Company IP.

  


 

  

(i) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result
in, under the terms of any agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is

Subsidiaries, including any of their products or services, (ii) the Company or
its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any rights or licenses to any
material Intellectual Property, (iii) Parent granting any third party any
rights or licenses to any Intellectual Property, (iv) the release or
disclosure of any material Trade Secrets (other than pursuant to this
Agreement) or (iv) the imposition of any Lien on any Owned Company IP.

  


 

  

(j) No Software that contains or is derived from open source software has been
incorporated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any Company
Products, or has otherwise been distributed or licensed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to Third Parties, in a manner that renders any Company
Products subject to license terms that require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) provide access to the corresponding source code of any
software contained in any Company Product or (ii) permit modification or free
redistribution of any software contained in any Company Product, except for
access to such source code or modification or free redistribution of such
software that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries is in violation of any open source license,
except for such violations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. "Open source" software means software that is licensed pursuant to a
license that upon distribution of such software (and modifications thereof),
purports to require the distributing party to (i) provide access to the
corresponding source code or (ii) permit modification or free redistribution
of such software (including the GNU General Public License).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

37

Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after January 1, 2006, except (i) in
connection with the distribution, sale or license of services or hardware or
software products in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, which source code disclosure does not materially differ from the
provisions in one of the Company's standard form source code license
agreements as set forth in Section 3.19(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (ii) for source code that has been placed into escrow pursuant to an
escrow agreement for customers in the ordinary course of business. No such
source code has been released or disclosed to the beneficiary thereof, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the
release from escrow of such source code.

  


 

  

(l) All use by the Company and its Subsidiaries of encryption-related
technology, or other technology that would require an export license or other
Permit, is set forth on Schedule 3.19(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Section 3.19(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

setting or other industry organization is in material compliance with all
rules, requirements and other obligations of any such organization. Except as
set forth on Section 3.19(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a member of, or party to, any patent
pool, industry standards body, trade association or other organization
pursuant to the rules of which it is obligated to license any Company IP to
any Third Party. All Company IP that is subject to the rules and regulations
of any standard setting or other industry organization that requires licensing
of such IP on a fair and reasonable or non-discriminatory basis is listed in
Section 3.19(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

nonexclusive license granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(o) The Company (or any Subsidiary or agent of the Company) has not granted
any warranties with respect to the Company Products that materially deviate
from the standard warranties Company provides with respect to such Company
Products and that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, a copy of
which warranty is included in Section 3.19(o) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. During the twelve months prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, its agents and
distributors, have not received any warranty claims related to the Company
Products that are (i) for amounts in excess of $50,000, (ii) claims under any
"epidemic failure" or similar clause, or (iii) other material claims outside
the ordinary course of business.

  


 

  

(p) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no unresolved security holes,
vulnerabilities, or other defects in the Company Products or information
technology systems used in their respective businesses that would permit
unauthorized or unknown access to computers or systems of users of those
Company Products or to the Company or its Subsidiaries information technology
systems, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps and implemented
reasonable procedures and systems, consistent with standard industry
practices, to prevent such unauthorized or unknown access and to identify,
detect and prevent any computer code, such as viruses or other disruptive or
disabling code, from entering Company Products.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(q) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain policies and procedures
regarding data security and privacy that are commercially reasonable and, in
any event, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.
There have been no security breaches relating to violations of any security
policy regarding or any unauthorized access of any data used in the business
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except for such breaches that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The use and dissemination of any
and all data and information concerning individuals by their businesses is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable privacy and data
security policies, terms of use, customer contracts and Laws. The transactions
contemplated hereby will not violate any privacy policy, terms of use or Laws
relating to the use, dissemination, or transfer of any such data or
information, nor will such transactions require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide any notice to, or seek any consent from, any employee,
customer, supplier, service provider or other third party under any policy of
the Company relating to data security and privacy.

  


 

  

Section 3.20. Insurance. Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all material policies of insurance covering the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their employees, properties or assets, including
policies of life, property, fire, workers' compensation, products liability,

full force and effect, no notice of cancellation has been received thereto,
and to the Company's knowledge, there is no existing material default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default, by any insured thereunder.

  


 

  

Section 3.21. Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in any Company
SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof, or for compensation or other
employment arrangements in the ordinary course, there are no transactions,

of the Company's capital stock necessary (under applicable Law or otherwise)
to adopt this Agreement. Subject to the accuracy of the representation set

that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the
DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not applicable to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who is entitled to any financial advisor's, brokerage,

transactions contemplated hereby.

effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger

view, to such stockholders. A copy of such opinion shall be delivered to

Company.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IV

  


 

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  


 

  

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  


 

  

Subject to Section 8.4, except, with respect to any Section of this Article
IV, as set forth in the section of the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent
to the Company on the date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule") that specifically relates to such Section and except as disclosed
in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Parent for the fiscal year ended February
28, 2010 (the "Parent Form 10-K"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K, in each case, filed from the date of the filing
of the Parent Form 10-K to the date of this Agreement (including as disclosed
in Parent's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30,
2010 in the draft form delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof)
(other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements"
sections of such reports and other disclosures that are similarly non-specific
and are predictive or forward-looking in nature), Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  


 

  

Section 4.1. Organization and Standing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware, with all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as it is presently being conducted and to
own, lease or operate its properties and assets. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its
activities make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has delivered or made available to the Company complete and correct
copies of each of its and Merger Sub's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, as amended to date, and each such instrument is in full force and
effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is not in violation of its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 4.2. Authorization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations
hereunder. Other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its capacity
as sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall occur immediately after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement), the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and
no other corporate or other proceeding on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each in accordance with

such amended or superseded filing), with the applicable requirements of the

such amended or superseded filing), each Parent SEC Report, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

reporting. A summary of any of these disclosures made by management to

commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared

the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any
amendment or supplement thereto, and each of Parent and the Company shall

Statement without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that the
Company, in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change, may amend
or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to a Qualifying
Amendment to effect such change. A "Qualifying Amendment" means an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the extent it contains (i)

foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall
not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with or declared
effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule

"Regulation M-A Filing") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing
is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall notify each other as
promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which
should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration
Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any such document would not

necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as practicable
thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law or
the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent and the
Company shall each notify the other as promptly as practicable after the
receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or
of any written or oral request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to, the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
any Regulation M-A Filing (including the time when the Registration Statement
becomes effective and the issuance of any stop order or suspension of
qualifications of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction), and shall promptly supply
the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the foregoing
filings and all Orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.
Prior to filing the Registration Statement or mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to stockholders (or filing or mailing any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto), each of Parent and the Company, as the case
may be, (i) shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such
document or response all comments reasonably and timely proposed by such other
party and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC
prior to receiving such other party's approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene, hold, and take a vote of stockholders on (i) the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (the "Merger Proposal"), (ii) the
approval of the adjournment of such meeting to a later date, if necessary, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
meeting to adopt this Agreement, and (iii) if required by SEC rules and
regulations, the approval of any executive officer compensation (present,
deferred, or contingent) paid or payable by the Company and relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the aggregate total of such
compensation and the conditions upon which it may be paid, if any
(collectively, the proposals described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 5.2(e) are referred to herein as the "Merger-Related Proposals") at a
meeting of the Company stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof (which, if reasonably
practicable, shall be within forty-five (45) days following the date on which
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first disseminated to Company stockholders).
Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 5.3, the Company Board
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any postponement
or adjournment thereof, including by soliciting proxies from Company
stockholders in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. At the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall submit to a vote of its stockholders
the Merger-Related Proposals. Except as required by applicable Law or in
compliance with the Company's bylaws with respect to properly submitted
stockholder proposals, the Company shall not propose for consideration or
submit for a vote any matters at the Company Stockholders Meeting (or an
adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting, if permitted hereunder) other
than the Company Stockholder Meeting Proposals without the prior written
consent of Parent. Except as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene or hold any meeting
of the Company stockholders unless and until the Company Stockholders Meeting
has been held, a vote of the Company stockholders has been taken on the Merger
Proposal and the Company Stockholders Meeting has been adjourned.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company's obligations under this Section 5.2 shall not be terminated,
superseded, limited, modified or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal, or by any Company Board Recommendation Change (whether or not in
compliance with the terms hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.1.

  


 

  

Section 5.3. No Solicitation.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each
officer and director of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any other Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the
making, submission of or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Third Party any non-public information with respect to, or knowingly
take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) release any (A) Third Party from any standstill agreement or
(B) Third Party that would reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition
Proposal from any confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party,
or fail to reasonably enforce or grant any material waiver, request or consent
to any Acquisition Proposal under, any such agreement. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company and the Company's and each such
Subsidiary's respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate
any existing solicitation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation
heretofore conducted by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or their
respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct each Third
Party which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to promptly
return or destroy all information, documents and materials relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or
affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to
such Third Party or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of
any confidentiality agreement with such Third Party. It is understood that any
violation of the restrictions of this Section 5.3(a) by any Representative of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed a breach of this
Section 5.3(a) by the Company.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 5.3(a), if, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in response to an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this
Agreement from a Third Party that has not resulted from a material breach or
violation of Section 5.3(a) and that the Company Board in good faith
determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to
the Company's stockholders under applicable Law, the Company and its
Representatives may, subject to the Company giving Parent at least twenty-four
hours prior written notice (which notice shall contain the identity of the
Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, a copy of the Acquisition
Proposal if it is in writing or otherwise a description of the material terms
and conditions pertinent thereto and a statement to the effect that the
Company Board has made the determination required by this Section 5.3(b) in
respect thereof and the Company intends to furnish non-public information to,
or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal), (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and
each Subsidiary of the Company to the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality agreement (A)
shall contain additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to
comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and (B) need not contain the
"standstill" provision set forth in Section 16 of the Confidentiality
Agreement), and (ii) engage in such negotiations or discussions with the Third
Party that made such Acquisition Proposal as the Company Board shall
determine. To the extent any information furnished to a Third Party pursuant
to this Section 5.3(b) was not previously furnished or made available to
Parent, the Company shall furnish or make available a copy of such information
to Parent promptly and in any event within twenty-four hours from the time
such information is furnished to the Third Party. The Company shall provide
Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement
entered into pursuant to this paragraph within twenty-four hours of the
execution thereof.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 5.3(d) or Section 5.3(e), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make the Company
Board Recommendation to holders of Company Common Stock, (ii) withdraw,
qualify, modify, change or amend (or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify,
modify, change or amend) in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation or (iii) approve or recommend or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that,
only with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, taking a neutral
position or no position (other than in a communication made in compliance with
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered a breach of this clause (iii)), (any
of the foregoing in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Company Board Recommendation
Change") or (iv) authorize the Company to, and the Company shall not, enter
into any agreement, agreement-in-principle, memorandum of understanding or
letter of intent with respect to, or accept, any Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section
5.3(b)).

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.3, at any time prior to
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board has received an
Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Board Recommendation Change if
prior to the Company Board taking any such action:

  


 

  

(i) the Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law;

  


 

  

(ii) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent a written notice, which
notice shall (x) state that the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal
which the Company Board has determined is a Superior Proposal and that the
Company Board intends to take such action and the manner in which it intends
or may intend to do so and (y) include the identity of the Third Party making
such Superior Proposal, the most current written draft agreement relating to
the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and all related
transaction agreements to which the Company would be a party, and (B) given
such notice to Parent at least four Business Days prior to taking any such
action (it being understood that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new four Business Day
period) and given Parent during such four Business Day period the opportunity
to meet or negotiate with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel, as
would permit the Company not to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
or take such action pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) in response to such a
Superior Proposal;

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(iii) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company, within four Business Days
after receipt by Parent of such notice, a written proposal capable of being
accepted to amend the terms contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Board
shall have in good faith determined (after consultation with outside legal
counsel), after considering the terms of such proposal by Parent, that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
and

  


 

  

(iv) the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i) and enters into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction
that constituted such Superior Proposal.

  


 

  

(e) The Company Board may also make a Company Board Recommendation Change at
any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the
absence of a Superior Proposal if a material fact, event, change, development
or set of circumstances that was not known by the Company Board as of or at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to
any Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances, an "Intervening Event") shall have occurred and be
continuing and prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change:

  


 

  

(i) the Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law;

  


 

  

(ii) the Company Board shall have (A) provided to Parent a written notice,
which notice shall (x) state that an Intervening Event has occurred and that
the Company Board intends to take such action and (y) describe the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail and (B) given such notice to Parent at least four
Business Days prior to taking any such action and given Parent during such
four Business Day period the opportunity to meet or negotiate with the Company
Board and its outside legal counsel as would permit the Company not to effect
a Company Board Recommendation Change; and

  


 

  

(iii) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written proposal capable
of being accepted to amend the terms contemplated by this Agreement, within
four Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company Board shall have
in good faith determined (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
after considering the terms of such proposal by Parent, that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Company Common
Stock a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act and
(ii) making any disclosure to the holders of Company Common Stock if the
Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that in no event shall this Section 5.3(f) affect the
obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.3.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.3, the Company shall promptly, and in any case within twenty-four
hours of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition
Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the Third Party or group making
any such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of all written materials provided in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms and
conditions (including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of
all written materials subsequently provided to or by the Company in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

Section 5.4. Access to Information.

  


 

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time and subject to applicable Law,
upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors and employees to, (i) provide Parent and its Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the facilities, properties,
employees (including all persons involved in the preparation of the Company's
financial statements, internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures
and financial reporting processes), books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' consultants and independent public accountants to
provide reasonable access to their work papers and such other information as
Parent may reasonably request, and (ii) furnish or make available to Parent
and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably request.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, trade secret protection or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information, or (iii) access to a Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate
or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights under, such Contract; provided, that if the Company does
not provide access or information in reliance on the foregoing, it shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information
to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or give rise to such a waiver. No information or knowledge obtained
by Parent or its Representatives in any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) From and after the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Company shall promptly notify the other upon obtaining knowledge that any
representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or that such party has breached
or failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such party under
this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, hold all documents and information furnished to it in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of that
certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement entered into between the Company and
Parent, dated August 4, 2010, as amended on August 9, 2010 and December 15,
2010 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  


 

  

Section 5.5. Governmental Filings.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to make any
filings required or in the parties' reasonable opinion advisable pursuant to
the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust, competition or merger
control Laws (the "Antitrust Laws") with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods or to obtain any Consents under the Antitrust Laws, as soon as
practicable.

  


 

  

(b) With respect to any matters relating to or proceedings under the Antitrust
Laws (collectively "Antitrust Matters"), the parties agree to (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Matter, (ii) to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, not participate independently in any such meeting without
first giving the other party (or the other party's outside counsel) an
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, (iii) to the extent
practicable, give the other party reasonable advance notice of all substantive
oral communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust
Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral
communication regarding any Antitrust Law, promptly notify the other party of
the substance of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and comment upon and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the Antitrust Laws) with a Governmental Entity regarding any
Antitrust Laws and (vi) promptly provide each other with copies of all written
communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust
Matters.

  


 

  

Section 5.6. Approvals and Consents. The parties shall cooperate with each
other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary or
advisable (in the parties' reasonable opinion) Consents, including, without
limitation, (a) all Consents of any Governmental Entity including those
described in Section 5.5 and (b) all Consents set forth in Section 3.5(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or described in Section 3.5(b), in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in taking such actions
or making any such filings, the parties hereto shall furnish information
required in connection therewith and seek to obtain any such Consents as soon
as practicable.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.7. Employee Benefits.

  


 

  

(a) Purchaser agrees to cause the Company, for the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending no earlier than December 31 of the year in which the
Closing Date occurs, to provide each Company Employee who is actively employed
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as of the Closing Date (such
Company Employees, the "Transferred Employees") with (i) a level of wages or
base salary that is at least equal to the level of wages or base salary which
such Transferred Employee was eligible to receive as of immediately prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) severance benefit protections for each Transferred
Employee that are no less favorable to the Transferred Employee than those
referenced on Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and applicable
to such employee, and (iii) employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity-
based plan, program or arrangement), which, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable than the employee benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based
plan, program or arrangement) which such Transferred Employee was eligible to
receive as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated, to continue to
employ any Transferred Employee or (except as contemplated by clause (ii)
above) maintain any particular employee benefit plan for any specific period
of time following the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, for all purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits, such
as the amount of any vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar
benefits, but not for benefit accrual purposes) under any "employee benefit
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to
whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA), program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Transferred Employee (including any previously-established
plan, program or arrangement covering any Transferred Employee) (the "Parent
Plans") on or after the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be
credited for all service credited to such Transferred Employee under similar
plans, programs or arrangements maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date in addition to service earned with Parent or any of
Parent's Affiliates after the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Current
Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under any similar Employee Plan in which such Current Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediate prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Parent and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to credit any
prior service of a Transferred Employee pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits.

  


 

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any U.S. group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each of the
Transferred Employees in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has
been made.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event
later than (x) the fifteenth Business Day immediately following the date
hereof, with respect to each individual listed on Section 5.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and (y) five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, with respect to each "disqualified individual" of
the Company (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) (other than those
individuals listed on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) that
the Company determines in good faith reasonably will have "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to
Parent a schedule that sets forth (A) the Company's reasonable, good faith
estimate of the amount of such parachute payments (separately identifying each
individual parachute payment) payable to each such individual, (B) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such
disqualified individual and (C) such underlying documentation as is reasonably
requested by Parent to support the calculations described in clauses (A) and
(B) above. The Company shall use good faith efforts to provide to Parent
reasonably sufficient evidence that the maximum amount that could be paid to
any individual not described in clauses (x) and (y) above will not result in
any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code. The
Company may make good faith assumptions in preparing such estimates, which
assumptions shall be outlined in the estimates.

  


 

  

(e) Unless otherwise requested by Parent prior to the Closing, the Company
shall take all necessary corporate action to terminate the Conexant Retirement
Savings Plan in a manner that complies with applicable Law, effective as of
the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, but contingent on the Closing.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall receive from the Company evidence
that the Company Board has adopted resolutions (previously approved by Parent,
which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld) to terminate such Plan,
effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date but contingent
on the Closing.

  


 

  

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.7 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any
employees (including any Company Employee), former employees, any participant
or any beneficiary thereof in any Employee Plan or employee benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent, or (ii) to continued employment with the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. After
the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.7 is intended to be or
shall be considered to be an amendment of any plan, program, agreement,
arrangement or policy of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, nor shall it interfere with Parent's, the Surviving
Corporation's or any of their Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or
terminate any Employee Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for any reason.

  


 

  

Section 5.8. Public Announcements. Except with respect to any Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.3, the Company, Merger Sub and
Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press releases or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any
press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other
parties' written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange or
Nasdaq rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto; provided, that the
party required to make such disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such disclosure, as well as
the timing of any such disclosure, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.9. Indemnification; Advancement; Insurance.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of not less than the applicable statutes of limitation, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, comply with all obligations of the Company that were in existence or in
effect as of the date hereof, under Law, its certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or by contract, relating to the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses to any current or former officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person who becomes a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(the "Indemnified Persons"). Each Indemnified Person, and his or her heirs and
legal representatives, is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
Section 5.9 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 5.9 shall not
limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have
under any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
Company's or any such Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other organization documents or otherwise under applicable Law. From and after
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
advancement of expenses and indemnification that are at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by
applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
each Indemnified Person or other person currently covered by the officers' and
directors' liability insurance policies of the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time
and providing at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms that
in the aggregate are not less advantageous to the insured parties than those
contained in the policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance in
effect as of the date hereof (the "Current Policy Coverage"); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, per annum, in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage; provided, further, that if the annual premium
required to provide the foregoing insurance exceeds 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide a policy that the Surviving
Corporation reasonably believes has the greatest coverage as can be purchased
for such premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may, without Parent's prior
consent, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current Policy
Coverage at a cost per year covered for such tail policy not to exceed the
Maximum Amount, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
Section 5.9(b).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 5.9(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against, and advance expenses to each Indemnified
Person in respect of, any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises out of or pertains to (i) any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person's
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or
(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent or the Surviving Corporation a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section
5.9(c), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

  


 

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this
Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.9). The rights of
the Indemnified Persons under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

  


 

  

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.9.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to Current Policy Coverage claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
under such policies.

Section 5.10. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner possible, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (a) vigorously contesting any Legal Proceeding or Order adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) executing any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required
under this Agreement to divest any portion of the business of Parent, any
Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that, in
each case, is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable (and the
Company shall not take any such action without the prior written approval of
Parent). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Effective Time to occur as soon as practicable. If at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall
take all such necessary action.

  


 

  

Section 5.11. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Company shall cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 5.12. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock (a) to be issued as the
Stock Consideration pursuant to the Merger and (b) to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of Company Stock Options, to be approved for listing upon the
Effective Time on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance.

  


 

  

Section 5.13. Takeover Laws. If any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 5.14. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.15. Certain Parent Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall not take any action with respect to a transaction
(other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that would
reasonably be expected to result in Parent having an obligation under the
federal securities Laws to provide pro forma financial information or
historical audited financial information with respect to such transaction (or
counterparty to such transaction) in the Registration Statement if such action
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the Closing; provided,
however, that this Section 5.15 shall not be deemed to restrict Parent from
entering into or, after the Effective Time, consummating a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, it being understood that in such event, Parent and Merger Sub would
remain subject to all of their obligations under this Agreement, including
their obligation to effect the Merger (subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2). For purposes of this Section 5.15,
the term "Parent Acquisition Proposal" shall have the same meaning as
"Acquisition Proposal" except that references in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" to (i) "the Company" shall be replaced with "Parent",
(ii) references to "20%" and "80%" shall be replaced by a "majority" and (iii)
references to "Third Party" shall be replaced with "Person or 'group' (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)".

  


 

  

Section 5.16. Actions in Connection with the Company's Debt.

  


 

  

(a) At any time from time to time after the date hereof, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to commence, promptly after the receipt of a written
request from Parent to do so, one or more offers to purchase (a "Debt Offer")
and/or consent solicitations (a "Consent Solicitation") with respect to the
outstanding 11.25% Notes on the terms and conditions specified by Parent, and
Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. The Company agrees
that, assuming the requisite consents are received, it shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the other
parties to the agreements and documents relating to the 11.25% Notes, as
applicable, to, execute supplemental indentures or amendments, as applicable,
to implement any proposed consent, amendment, supplement or waiver.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the closing of any Debt Offer shall be
conditioned on the completion of the Merger, (ii) no Consent Solicitation
shall result in a consent, amendment, supplement or waiver with respect to the
Indenture that is effective prior to the Closing and adverse to the Company in
any material respect (other than payment of any consent fee for which the
Company is immediately reimbursed by Parent) and (iii) any Debt Offer or
Consent Solicitation shall otherwise be consummated in compliance with
applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to provide, cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with any Debt Offer or Consent Solicitation. If
requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer or Consent
Solicitation for the 11.25% Notes (or in addition thereto), the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to, to the extent permitted by the
terms and conditions applicable to the 11.25% Notes (including the Indenture),
issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding principal
amount of the 11.25% Notes in accordance with the terms and conditions
applicable thereto (including the Indenture); provided that no action
described in this sentence shall be required to be taken unless it can be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. Subject to the Company's
compliance with Section 5.16(b), Parent shall ensure that at the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation has all funds necessary in connection with any
Debt Offer or redemption. The Company shall facilitate access to Parent and
its Representatives to the holders of the 11.25% Notes and shall cooperate
with, and participate in, discussions with such holders, in each case to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) At any time from time to time after the date hereof, the Company shall
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to provide,
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any debt
financing (the "Potential Financing") that Parent determines to be reasonably
necessary or desirable in connection with any of the actions described in
Section 5.16(a) or otherwise in connection with the 11.25% Notes, including,
subject to customary representations and confidentiality requirements, (i)
providing information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any
parties that Parent reasonably anticipates may provide commitments with
respect to, or otherwise participate in, the Potential Financing (the
"Potential Financing Sources"), (ii) to the extent reasonably requested by
Parent, assisting in preparation of customary offering or information
documents to be used for the arrangement and/or completion of the Potential
Financing, including the provision of information necessary to produce the
business plan, financial projections and pro forma financial statements
reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) making available Representatives of the
Company to participate in customary meetings, presentations and due diligence
sessions with rating agencies and prospective Potential Financing Sources,
(iv) executing and delivering, and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver, documents and instruments relating to guarantees and other matters
ancillary to the Potential Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
as necessary and customary in connection with the Potential Financing, (v)
providing authorization letters to Potential Financing Sources in respect of
the distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors, (vi)
providing audited consolidated financial statements of the Company covering
the three (3) fiscal years immediately preceding the Closing for which audited
consolidated financial statements are currently available, unaudited financial
statements (excluding footnotes) for any interim period or periods of the
Company ended after the date of the most recent audited financial statements
and at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date (within 45 days after the end
of each such period) and (vii) reasonable assistance to Parent in satisfying
the conditions precedent to the funding of any Potential Financing; provided,
however, that until the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall (A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee, (B) have any liability or any obligation under any credit agreement or
any related document or any other agreement or document related to the
Potential Financing or (C) be required to incur any other liability in
connection with the Potential Financing unless reimbursed or indemnified by
Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company.

  


 

  

(c) Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives after the date hereof in connection with the
actions of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.16, (ii) acknowledges and agrees that the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not incur
any liability to any person prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
Debt Offer, Consent Solicitation or redemption of the 11.25% Notes and (iii)
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.16.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither (i) the pendency or
consummation of any Debt Offer, Consent Solicitation or redemption with
respect to the 11.25% Notes nor (ii) the availability to Parent of any
Potential Financing is a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

offer that the Company's stockholders not tender their Shares in such tender

relieve any party from liability for any willful and material breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination. The provisions of Section 5.4(d), this

7.3(c), references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" and

that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due

commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent Parent's reasonable costs and

Notice so given shall (in the case of notice so given by mail or overnight
courier) be deemed to be given when received and (in the case of notice so
given by facsimile, e-mail transmission or personal delivery) on the date of

Section 8.3. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the
parties hereto will bear all legal, accounting, investment banking and other
fees, expenses and costs incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such
transactions are consummated.

  


 

  

Section 8.4. Disclosure Generally. A matter set forth in one item of either
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule need not be set
forth in any other item of such Schedule so long as its relevance to the other
sections or subsections of such Schedule or section of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in such Schedule
(without reference to the underlying documents referenced therein). The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in either the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to (a) mean that
such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement; (b) represent
a determination that (i) such item is material or establishes a standard of
materiality, (ii) such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business,
or (iii) the Merger requires the consent of third parties; or (c) constitute,
or be deemed to be, an admission to any third party concerning such item. Such
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a
basis for interpreting the terms "material," "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 8.5. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
Parent and by action taken by or on behalf of the respective boards of
directors of Merger Sub and the Company at any time before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which under the DGCL
requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto.

  


 

  

Section 8.6. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.5, waive compliance by the
other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only against such party and only if set forth in an instrument,
in writing, signed by such party. The failure or delay by any party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights nor shall any single or partial assertion of a right preclude any other
or further assertion thereof or the exercise of any other right. The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by Law.

Section 8.7. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except (a) as provided in Section 5.9, (b) from and
after the Effective Time, the rights of stockholders of the Company to receive
the Merger Consideration set forth in Article II, and (c) the rights of each
of the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with the debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and their successors and assigns to enforce
the provisions of Section 8.9, nothing in this Agreement express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
in violation of this Section 8.7 shall be null and void and of no effect.

  


 

  

Section 8.8. Governing Law. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

  


 

  

Section 8.9. Jurisdiction.

  


 

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby
submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, in the of event any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim
any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service of
process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 8.2.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any entities that have
committed (or after the date hereof commit) to provide or otherwise have
entered (or after the date hereof enter) into agreements in connection with
the debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (such entities being referred to herein as the "Lenders"),
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof). The intention of the parties is that
disputes among the parties be litigated in the courts of Delaware. All parties
waive any argument that Delaware is an inappropriate forum because
jurisdiction over the Lenders may only be obtained in New York and/or that the
Lenders are indispensible parties and, in their absence, a suit in Delaware
cannot proceed. The parties further agree and consent in advance that, in the
event the parties are nonetheless joined in any action involving the Lenders
in a New York court, either party may move to sever and transfer to a court in
Delaware the disputes between the parties, and neither party shall oppose such
a request to sever and transfer that portion of the action. Finally, nothing
in this paragraph is intended to alter or limit the parties' choice of
Delaware law to govern disputes among them.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Without limiting other means of service of process permissible under
applicable Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
the respective addresses set forth in Section 8.2 shall be effective service
of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(d) EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING CONTEMPLATED BY PARAGRAPH (b) ABOVE)
BASED ON ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  


 

  

Section 8.10. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
maximum extent possible.

  


 

  

Section 8.11. Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, and
delivered by means of facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 8.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings both written and oral between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  


 

  

Section 8.14. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled equitable relief
without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

   
 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
