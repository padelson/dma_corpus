There has been no material loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use, modification, or other misuse of any such information by Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their respective employees or, to the knowledge of the Company, contractors).
Since February&nbsp;1, 2006, to the knowledge of the Company, no person (including any Governmental Authority) has made any Claim or commenced any Action with respect to loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use, modification, or other misuse of any
such personally identifiable information by Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their respective employees or contractors) (and to the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such Claim or Action). The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions complies (and the disclosure to and use by Surviving Corporation and Parent and its Affiliates of such information after the Effective Time will comply) with
Company&#146;s and the Company Subsidiaries&#146; applicable privacy policies and in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to privacy and data security (including any such Laws in the jurisdictions where the applicable information
is collected). Company and the Company Subsidiaries have at all times made all disclosures to, and obtained any necessary consents from, users, customers, employees, contractors and other applicable persons required by applicable Laws related to
privacy and data security and have filed any required registrations with the applicable data protection authority (and a list of those registrations is listed in Section&nbsp;4.27 of the Disclosure Schedule). </FONT></P> <P

critical to the Company and Company Subsidiaries (including such data and information that is stored on magnetic or optical media in the ordinary course of business) in a commercially reasonable attempt to avoid material disruption or interruption
to the business of Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have in place industry standard (and, in any event, not less than commercially reasonable) disaster recovery and business continuity plans and procedures.
