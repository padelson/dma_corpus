2.1 The Offer.

(a) _Provided_ , that nothing shall have occurred that gives rise to a right
of Parent to terminate the Offer or this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that none of the conditions set forth in Sections (iii)(c) through (iii)(e) of
Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date that
Purchaser would otherwise commence the Offer; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company has fulfilled its obligation to provide information to Parent
and Purchaser on a timely basis as contemplated by Section 2.1(f), Purchaser
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Parent or
Purchaser shall provide the Company with prior written notice if Purchaser
fails to commence the Offer within 10 business days of the date of this
Agreement together with a brief explanation of the reasons therefore.

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (x) the
condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that at least that number of Company
Shares equal to (i) fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding Company
Shares on a fully diluted basis (including all Company Shares potentially
issuable upon the conversion of any convertible securities or upon the
exercise of any options, warrants or rights (other than the Rights) including
the Company RSUs, in each case, which are convertible or exercisable prior to
the Outside Date but excluding the Subject Shares) _plus_ (ii) the Subject
Shares, shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer and (y) the other conditions set forth in Annex A
hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at
any time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to amend or waive any
such condition (other than the Minimum Condition which may not be amended or
waived), to increase the price per Company Share payable in the Offer, and to
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
that without the prior written consent of the Company no change may be made
that decreases the price per Company Share payable in the Offer, changes the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, reduces the maximum number of
Company Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, adds to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in Annex A hereto, extends the Offer other than as set
forth in this Section 2.1, or modifies or amends any condition to the Offer in
any manner adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th)
business day beginning with (and including) the date that the Offer is
commenced (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless the period of time for which the
Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the provisions of this Section 2.1(c) (in which event the term "
_Expiration Date_ " shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so
extended, may expire). Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company,
extend the Offer for one or more periods beyond the scheduled expiration date
if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the conditions to
Purchasers obligation to accept Company Shares for payment shall not be
satisfied or waived, for such period of time as Purchaser reasonably
determines to be necessary to permit such conditions to be satisfied or
waived. In addition, Purchaser shall extend the Offer:

(i) for two successive 10 business day periods beyond the original Expiration
Date if at the original Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any
extension thereof pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i) the Minimum Condition is
not satisfied but none of the other conditions to Purchasers obligation to
accept Company Shares for payment shall fail to be satisfied or waived by
Parent or Purchaser;



 

\- 12 - (ii) if, at the end of any scheduled expiration of the Offer, the conditions
to the consummation of the Offer set forth in Sections (iii)(d) or (iii)(e)
of Annex A hereto shall have occurred such that any of the conditions set
forth in Section (iii)(d) or (iii)(e) in Annex A, as applicable, would fail to
be satisfied, for such period of time as is necessary to provide the Company
with a ten (10) business day period measured from the date of receipt of
notice of an inaccuracy or breach to cure such inaccuracy or breach; provided
that such inaccuracy or breach is reasonably capable of being cured within
such time period and provided, further that Purchaser shall only be required
to extend the Offer once pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)(ii);

(iii) for one or more periods beyond any scheduled expiration date for any
period required by any Law, rule, regulation or interpretation of the SEC, or
the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer; and

(iv) (A) for one or more periods beyond any scheduled expiration date if, at
the scheduled expiration of the Offer or at the scheduled expiration of
any subsequent offering periods (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act), none of the conditions or events set forth in Annex A hereto
(other than Sections (i) and (ii)) shall have occurred or be continuing, for
such period of time necessary to permit the condition in Section (ii) of
Annex A hereto to be satisfied; and (B) for one ten (10) business day period
following the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section (ii) of Annex
A hereto. 

Purchaser also may, without the consent of the Company, provide for one or
more subsequent offering periods (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension provided for
in this Section 2.1(c) shall extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement
or the termination of this Agreement, and without limiting, restricting or
otherwise impairing the rights of Parent or Purchaser following any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall be
permitted to continue the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(f). If
Purchaser shall elect to continue the Offer pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.1(f), Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree
that (i) the Company shall not amend the Rights Agreement in a manner
inconsistent with Section 4.25 and (ii) the waiver by the Company Board of the
applicability of the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL to the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger (as may be amended by Parent
and Purchaser following any such termination), shall continue in full force
and effect until Purchaser shall withdraw the Offer or the Offer shall have
expired or terminated in accordance with the terms thereof without Purchaser
(or Parent on Purchasers behalf) having accepted for payment any Company
Shares pursuant to the Offer. If Purchaser shall elect to continue the Offer
pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) and such Offer is not consummated prior to
the approval by the Company stockholders of an acquisition of the Company
following termination of this Agreement by the Company  



 

\- 13 -  pursuant to Section 9.1(f), Parent agrees that it shall terminate the Offer
after such approval by the Company stockholders of such acquisition,
but prior to the closing of such acquisition. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated in Section 2.1(d), in the event that Purchaser is not
permitted, or does not elect, to continue the Offer pursuant to this Section
2.1(d), Purchaser shall terminate the Offer upon termination of this
Agreement.

(e) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of
taxes, be net to the applicable seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer. Purchaser or Parent on Purchasers behalf shall
pay for all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly
following the Acceptance Date. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and
conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay
payment for Company Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with
applicable Laws. If payment of the Per Share Amount is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly
evidencing Company Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Amount to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Purchaser that
such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
TO_") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ")
and form of the related letter of transmittal and any other ancillary
documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (the Schedule TO, the Offer
to Purchase and such other documents, together with all exhibits, supplements
and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer
Documents_ "). Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares in all
material respects to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and the
Company agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for
use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated
to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all material respects as
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Purchaser or Parent all information concerning the Company that is
required or reasonably requested by Purchaser or Parent in connection with
their obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action contemplated
by this Section 2.1(f). Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO
before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to
(i) provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a
reasonably  



 

\- 14 -  detailed description of any oral comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii)
provide the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any written or oral response to such comments or any proposed
amendment to the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

(g) If, between the date of this Agreement and the first date on which any
particular Company Share is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Date_ "), the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by means of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount applicable
to such Company Share shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.2 Company Action.

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of such approval and of the determination and
recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b). The Company
shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to
Purchaser or Parent except as provided in Section 7.5(b). The Company
represents that it has been advised by its directors and executive officers
that they intend to tender all Company Shares beneficially owned by them to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

(b) Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO by Purchaser, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") containing, except as provided in Section 7.5(b), the recommendation
of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b). The Company shall promptly
mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of Company Shares together with the
Offer Documents and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated in all material respects as required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of federal securities laws. The Company, Parent
and Purchaser agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of
them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all
material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent or
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably requested by the Company
in connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel in writing with any written comments the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent, Purchaser and their  



 

\- 15 -  counsel a reasonably detailed description of any oral comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments, and (iii) provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral response to such
comments or any proposed amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to promptly
furnish) to Purchaser mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Company Shares and with security position listings of
Company Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together
with all other available listings and computer files containing names,
addresses and security position listings of record holders and beneficial
owners of Company Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be
furnished to Purchaser such additional information, including updated listings
and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to
holders of Company Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request.
Subject to the requirements of Law, including applicable stock exchange rules,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger,
Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in
such labels, listings and files and shall use such information only in
connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Confidentiality Agreement or the termination of this Agreement and without
limiting, restricting or otherwise impairing the rights of Parent or Purchaser
following any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, if
Parent and Purchaser elect to continue the Offer (as may be amended in a
manner consistent with the terms hereof) notwithstanding the termination of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(f), Parent and
Purchaser shall be permitted to retain and use any and all such information
for purposes of disseminating and otherwise communicating the Offer and the
related Offer Documents to the record and beneficial holders of Company
Shares.

2.3 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of Company Shares (the
" _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares
that, when added to the number of Company Shares collectively owned by Parent
or Purchaser at the time of exercise, shall constitute one Company Share more
than 90% of the then outstanding Company Shares on a fully diluted basis
(including all Company Shares potentially issuable upon the conversion of any
convertible securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights
(other than the Rights) including the Company RSUs, in each case, which are
convertible or exercisable prior to the Outside Date), at a purchase price per
Top-Up Option Share equal to the Per Share Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(a), the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for Company Shares in excess of the number of Company Shares
authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company (giving effect
to the Company Shares issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding Company
Stock Options, RSUs and any other rights to acquire Company Shares as if such
shares were outstanding).



 

\- 16 - (b) Either Parent or Purchaser may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up
Option at any time after the Acceptance Date and prior to the earlier of (A)
the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement.

(c) If either Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall send to the Company a written notice
(a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying the place for the closing of the
purchase the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ") and a date not
earlier than one business day nor later than ten business days after the date
of the Top-Up Exercise Notice for the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written
notice to Parent or Purchaser confirming (i) the number of Company Shares then
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) the number of Top-Up Option
Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor.

(d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent or Purchaser a certificate
or certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares and
(ii) Parent or Purchaser shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the

accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements, including all
federal securities laws.

(e) Upon the delivery by Parent or Purchaser to the Company of the Top-Up
Exercise Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in Section
2.3(d), Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the holder
of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise,
notwithstanding that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares
shall not then be actually delivered to Parent or Purchaser or the Company
shall have failed or refused to designate the account described in Section
2.3(d).

(f) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
include legends legally required by applicable securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that Parent or Purchaser

hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it is, or will be upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing and to provide, as the
case may be, that Purchaser or such other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent

Agreement.

or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a

State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of
such filing, or such later time as shall be agreed by Parent and the Company
and specified in such filing, being the " _Effective Time_ "). Prior to such
filing, a closing shall be held at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 425

shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the
case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article 8\.

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

3.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation; _provided_ , that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall read as follows: "The name of the
corporation is Wind River Systems, Inc."

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to conform to the By-laws of Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and,  



 

\- 18 -  except as determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_
") payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such
Company Share. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate (taking
into account any prior adjustments pursuant to Section 2.1(g)) for
all purposes of this Article 3\.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment
or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be
delivered with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

3.7 Employee Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company ESPP.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock
Options, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is held by a Continuing Employee and not described in the
following sentence (a " _Continuing Option_ ") will be assumed by Parent. A
Company Stock Option shall not be considered a Continuing Option if the
Company Stock Option is subject to the Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
Parent determines the Company Stock Option may not be converted into a
Continuing Option (1) under a Law of the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction
(including by reason of a failure to obtain any required regulatory consents
or approvals after making reasonable commercial efforts), (2) under the
policies and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of equity awards in
the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction, or (3) due to Parents administrative
practices with respect to equity awards. Parent will notify the Company at
least twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time of the Company Stock
Options that will not be Continuing Options pursuant to the previous
sentence.  



 

\- 19 -  Each Continuing Option assumed by Parent will continue to have, and be
subject to the same terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (as such terms and conditions have been amended in
accordance with Section 7.6(d) of this Agreement), including the vesting
restrictions, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the
holder of the Continuing Option or to which the holder consents and except
that (i) each Continuing Option will be exercisable for a number of shares of
common stock of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the product of
the number of Company shares that would be issuable upon exercise of the
Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by a quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger Consideration by
(B) the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market for the five trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
assumed Continuing Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the per share exercise price for such Continuing Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent, and (iii) all references to the "Company" in the
applicable Company Stock Option Plans and the stock option agreements will be
references to Parent. It is the intention of the parties that each Company
Stock Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time
as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Company
Stock Option qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) Each Company Stock Option that is not a Continuing Option (a "
_Terminating Option_ ") shall in each case be cancelled at the Effective Time
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such option by (y) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Terminating Option (after giving effect to any acceleration
provided under the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan under
which the Company Stock Option was granted, the applicable stock option
agreement, and any other Plan disclosed in Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule as such Plan is amended in connection with this Agreement), less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by law to be withheld in
respect of such payment.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holders of
Company RSUs, each outstanding restricted stock unit or performance share
under the Company Stock Option Plans (such restricted stock units and
performance shares, the " _Company RSUs_ ") that is then outstanding,
unvested and held by a Continuing Employee and not described in the following
sentence (a " _Continuing RSU_ ") will be assumed by Parent. A Company RSU
shall not be considered a Continuing RSU if the Company RSU is subject to the
Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and Parent determines the Company RSU may not
be converted into a Continuing RSU (1) under a Law of the relevant non-U.S.
jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain any required
regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable commercial efforts),
(2) under the policies and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of
equity awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction, or (3) due to Parents
administrative practices with respect  



 

\- 20 -  to equity awards. Parent will notify the Company at least twenty (20) days
prior to the Effective Time of the Company RSUs that will not be
Continuing RSUs pursuant to the previous sentence. Each Continuing RSU
assumed by Parent will continue to have and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions of such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
such terms and conditions have been amended in accordance with Section 7.6(d)
of this Agreement), including the vesting restrictions, except for
administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Continuing
RSU or to which the holder consents and except that (i) each Company RSU
shall cover a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of Company Shares that would be issuable under the Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Company Stock and
(ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Option
Plans and restricted stock unit agreements will be references to Parent. Each
Company RSU (or any portion thereof) that vests and becomes settlable by its
terms at the Effective Time will not be assumed but will instead be converted
into the right to receive, in exchange for the cancellation of such
Company RSU (or portion thereof), an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (or settlable portion thereof)
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any such payment shall be subject to
all applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.

(d) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holders of Company RSUs, each Company RSU
that is not a Continuing RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time (each, a " _Terminating RSU_
"). Each holder of a Terminating RSU (after giving effect to any acceleration
provided under the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan under
which the Company RSU was granted, the applicable restricted stock unit
agreement, and any other Plan disclosed in Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule as such Plan is amended in connection with this Agreement) shall be
eligible to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Terminating RSU, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld
in respect of such payment.

(e) The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that it
will take all actions necessary with respect to the 1993 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") so that (i) the Company ESPP shall be
suspended immediately following the end of the offering period in effect as of
the date hereof after all outstanding purchase rights (if any) have been
exercised (the "Final Purchase"), and no offering periods or purchase periods
shall be thereafter commenced and no payroll deductions or other contributions
(other than payroll deductions pursuant to elections in effect as of the date
hereof as to the offering period in effect as of the date hereof) shall be
thereafter made or effected with respect to the Company ESPP, and (iii) notice
shall be given to participants in the Company ESPP as soon as
administratively practicable following the date hereof describing the
suspension of the Company ESPP pursuant to this Section 3.7(e) immediately
following the Final Purchase, and (iv) the Company ESPP shall terminate
effective upon the Effective Time.

(f) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding award
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan describing the treatment of
such award in accordance with this Section 3.7.



 

\- 21 - (g) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs as provided pursuant to Section 3.7,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by Sections 3.7(a) and
3.7(c). Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 (to the extent available) with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to such Continuing Options and Continuing RSUs and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared
effective as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) business days, following the Effective Time. It is intended that the
assumption of the Continuing Options assumed by Parent shall comply with
Sections 409A and 424 of the Code and this Section 3.7 shall be construed
consistent with such intent.

3.8 Dissenting Shares. 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and
after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Company Shares shall not
have and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other
rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. Such stockholders shall
be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Company Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by stockholders who shall
have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9, of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Dissenting Company Shares.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments, notices, petitions, or other communication received from
stockholders or provided to stockholders by Company with respect to any
Dissenting Company Shares or shares claimed to be Dissenting Company Shares,
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Payment of any amount
payable to the holders of Dissenting Company Shares shall be the obligation of
Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.



 

\- 22 - 3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of
funds to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 3.6(a). From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent or
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a). The Paying Agent
shall make payment of the funds to holders of Company Shares in accordance
with this Section 3.9. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent or (after the Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation,
and any and all interest earned on the funds shall be paid by the Paying Agent
to Parent or (after the Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation. The
Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including
those of Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of funds to
holders of Company Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.6(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Company Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate
shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit
of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates. 

(c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving  



 

\- 23 -  Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Company Share
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other
similar law.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against claims that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

3.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Article 2 or 3 of this Agreement
to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and
paid over to the appropriate Government Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

3.11 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall
be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such
action.

another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens or Contracts or other
limitations on the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys voting rights.

(e) Section 4.3(e) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of (i) all

Option would normally be expected to expire absent termination of employment
or other acceleration, and (vi) with respect to Company Stock Options, whether
or not such Company Stock Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock

grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "
_Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable,
approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof), or a duly authorized delegate thereof, and any required stockholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents; each such
grant was made in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Option Plan and all other applicable Law; each such
grant intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of
the Code so qualifies; and the per share exercise price of each Company Stock
Option was not less than the fair market value of a Company Share on the
applicable Grant Date.

Company Shares, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions
(such approval and adoption having been made in accordance with the DGCL),

rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way.

4.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

subject to obtaining the Company Required Approvals and, in the case of the
Merger, the Required Shareholder Vote, if required, conflict with or violate
any U.S. or non-U.S. law (statutory, common or otherwise), including any

judgment, decree or other order of a Governmental Authority (" _Law_ ")
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property

Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default or breach) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material benefit under any
Company Material Contract or material Permit to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for (x) applicable requirements,
if any, of the Exchange Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue

documents as required by the DGCL (collectively, the " _Company Required
Approvals_ "), and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.



 

\- 28 - 4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the " _Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and there have occurred no defaults
under, violations of, or events giving rise to a right of termination,
amendment or cancellation of any such Permits (with or without notice, the
lapse of time or both), except where the failure to have, or the

Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (ii) any Company Material Contract or
material Permit to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or
by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts,
defaults, breaches or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger
and would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has, since February 1, 2007, received any written
notice from any Governmental Authority alleging that it is not in compliance
in all material respects with any Law.

4.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

such amendment), contain, or if filed after the date hereof at the time of
filing will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary has been or is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.



 

\- 29 - (b)(i) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the SEC
Reports (collectively, the " _Audited Company Financial Statements_ ") (A)

in all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of

normal and recurring year-end adjustments). (ii) The unaudited financial
information contained in the Companys earnings release set forth in Section

the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at January 31, 2009,
including the notes thereto (the " _2009 Balance Sheet_ "), neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), and there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to result in such a liability or obligation, except for (x)

Sheet that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and (y) liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement
or as required by this Agreement. Section 4.7(c)-1 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a description of all indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries greater than $500,000 individually or in the
aggregate (other than any indebtedness owed to the Company or a Company

under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the

has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract
or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or other
of the SEC Reports.

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting and accounting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

(g) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(h) The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended January
31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.
Since February 1, 2006, the Company has disclosed to the Companys outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Company (and made copies of such
disclosures available to Parent) (A) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, (B) any  



 

\- 31 -  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting, and (C) any claim or allegation of any of the foregoing. Since
February 1, 2006, the Company has not received from its independent auditors
any oral or written notification of a (i) "reportable condition" or (ii)
"material weakness" in the Companys internal controls. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall have
the meanings assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as
in effect on the date hereof.

(i) The Company has furnished Parent with copies of all comment letters
received by the Company from the SEC since February 1, 2006, relating to the

its attorneys from the SEC, and there are no pending (i) formal or, to the
knowledge of the Company, informal investigations of the Company by the SEC
or (ii) inspection of an audit of the Companys financial statements by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since February 1, 2006 there has
been no material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has engaged in improper or illegal accounting or
auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal accounting
controls. Since February 1, 2006, no current or former attorney representing
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof or to any director or
executive officer of the Company.

harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of
employment because of any lawful act of such employee described in Section
806 of SOX.

(k) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies
of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed by the Company
with the SEC to all Contracts, documents and other instruments that previously
had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently in effect.

Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and
in a manner consistent with past practice. Since the date of the 2009 Balance
Sheet (i) there has not been any event, condition, circumstance,
development, change or effect, having, or that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action
that if taken between the date hereof and the Effective Time would constitute
a breach of Section 6.1.

hearing, proceeding, arbitration or mediation pending, or (B) to the
knowledge of the Company, (x) no inquiry or investigation pending or (y)

impose any legal restraint on or prohibition against or limit the Surviving

to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to any Third

asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any continuing
order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement
with, or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing investigation by, any
Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Authority that would prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger or reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are
not currently pending, nor have there been since February 1, 2007, any
internal investigations or inquiries conducted by the Company, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
third party at the request of any of the foregoing concerning any financial,
accounting, tax, conflict of interest, illegal activity, fraudulent or
deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance involving the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective officers or employees. As

Contract to provide compensation or benefits to any individual other than in
the ordinary course of business, or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any
Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by ERISA, the Code or other applicable law.

(b) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), a "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within

person, (ii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or
partially as a result of any Transaction, or (iii) obligates the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit in
connection with a "change in ownership or effective control", within the
meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code, or in connection with an
event directly or indirectly related to such a change. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has become obligated to make, or will as a result
of any event connected directly or indirectly with any transaction
contemplated herein become obligated to make, any "excess parachute payment"
as defined in Section 280G of the Code. There is no written or unwritten
Contract, plan, arrangement or other contract by which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound to compensate any individual for excise taxes
paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. None of the Plans provides for or
 



 

\- 34 -  promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any

Company Subsidiary, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6
of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state law.

(c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under and
are not in default under or in violation of, and there is no default or
violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business) and to the knowledge
of the Company, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such
Action.

(d) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to
the US Plan for which determination letters are currently available that the
US Plan is so qualified, has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or
may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan, and each trust
established in connection with any US Plan that is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, has a remaining period
of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which
to apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype
plan, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination
letter or letters from the IRS (or in the preceding seven (7) years if no
favorable determination letter exists) that could be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such US Plan or the exempt status of any
such trust.

(e) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Plan. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under, arising out of or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or
(ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that could give
rise to any such liability.

(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any US Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All
such contributions are or were fully deductible for federal income tax
purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any
Governmental Authority and no fact or event exists that could be expected to
give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

(g) Section 4.10(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Plan that
provides any compensation that could be deemed deferred compensation within
the meaning of  



 

\- 35 -  Section 409A of the Code, and each such Plan is in compliance with Section
409A of the Code. No event has occurred that would be treated by Section
409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of Section 83 of the Code.

(h) The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be
made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or pursuant to other arrangements with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Plans, to holders of
Company Common Stock and other securities of the Company (the " _Covered
Securityholders_ ") (with all such plans and arrangements being collectively
referred to as the " _Company Arrangements_ "). All such amounts payable under
the Company Arrangements (i) have been or are being paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) were not, and are
not, calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The adoption, approval,
amendment or modification of each Company Arrangement has been approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution
of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Company Compensation
Committee_ ") or its independent directors. A true and complete copy of any
resolutions of any committee of the Company Board reflecting any approvals and
actions referred to in the preceding sentence and taken prior to the date of
this Agreement has been made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

(i) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each plan, program
or arrangement described in Section 4.10(a) that is not subject to U.S. law
(a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "):

(i) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made,
or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices, and
a _pro_ _rata_  contribution for the period prior to and including the date
of this Agreement has been made or accrued;

(ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded
through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the benefits determined on an ongoing basis accrued to the date of
this Agreement with respect to all current and former participants under such
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and

(iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities and is  



 

\- 36 -  approved by any applicable taxation authorities to the extent such approval
is available. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated
in material compliance with all applicable Laws.

the employment practices of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than
charges or Actions, individually or in the aggregate, that would not (i)

under applicable data privacy/protection Laws. As of the date hereof, no
officer or employee holding the position of vice president or above has
terminated or has advised the Company or any Company Subsidiary of his or her
intention to terminate his or her relationship or status as an employee or
consultant of the Company or the Subsidiary for any reason, including because
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
except as set forth on Section 4.11(c)-1 of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company and the Subsidiary have no plans or intentions as of the date hereof
to terminate any such employee or consultant. Section 4.11(c)-2 of the

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state  



 

\- 38 -  any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

4.13 Property and Leases.

(a) The Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries owns, and has good title
to, each of the tangible assets reflected as owned by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries on the 2009 Balance Sheet (except for tangible assets
sold or disposed of since that date in the ordinary course of business and
sales after the date of the 2009 Balance Sheet of assets no longer required
for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted) free of any Liens
other than Permitted Title Exceptions; _provided_ , that no representation is
made under this Section 4.13 with respect to Intellectual Property Rights.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have sufficient title to all their
properties and assets to conduct their respective businesses as currently
conducted, with only such exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the machinery, equipment and
other tangible personal property and assets owned or used by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are in the condition and repair sufficient to
conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such
exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 4.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all real property owned by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (" _Company Owned Real Property_ "). The Company and/or the
Company Subsidiaries have good, valid and marketable title in fee simple to
all Company Owned Real property, free and clear of all Liens of any nature
whatsoever except (i) Liens for current Taxes, payments of which are not yet
delinquent or are being disputed in good faith, (ii) such imperfections in
title and easements and encumbrances, if any, as are not substantial in
character, amount or extent and do not materially detract from the value, or
interfere with the present use of the property subject thereto or affected
thereby, or otherwise materially impair the Companys or any of the Company
Subsidiaries business operations (in the manner presently carried on by the
Company or such Company Subsidiaries), and (iii) for such matters that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
(collectively with the matter disclosed in the  



 

\- 39 -  Disclosure Schedule, the " _Permitted Title Exceptions_ "). The Company
Owned Real Property is not subject to any special assessment, condemnation,
eminent domain, zoning or other land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change
in any Law or Permit that would prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or that seeks to impose any material legal
restraint on or prohibition against or limit the Surviving Corporations
ability to operate the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
substantially as it was operated prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to the Company Owned Real Property. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has leased or otherwise granted to any other person any
rights to occupy or possess any part of the Company Owned Real Property,
except for any such leases or grants that have previously terminated and
leases of excess space that do not materially and adversely effect the conduct
of the Companys business as presently conducted. There are no outstanding
options or other contractual rights to purchase, lease or use, or rights of
first refusal to purchase, the Company Owned Real Property or any portion
thereof or interests therein or contracts relating to the right to receive any
portion of the income or profits from the sale, operation or development
thereof. To the knowledge of the Company, all utility systems situated on and
serving the Company Owned Real Property are adequate and suitable in all
material respects for the purpose of conducting the Companys business as
presently conducted.

(c) Section 4.13(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all material leases of real property (" _Company Leased Real
Property_ ") to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party. All
such leases of real property to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party, and all amendments and modifications thereto, are in full force
and effect and have not been modified or amended, and there exists no default
under any such lease by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as would not
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger and as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except in compliance in all material respects with the term of the applicable
lease, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any material
alterations, additions or improvements to the leased property that are
required to be removed (or of which any landlord or sublandlord could require
removal) at the termination of the applicable lease term. The Company Leased
Real Property is not subject to any special assessment, condemnation, eminent
domain, zoning or other land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change in any
Law or Permit that would prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or that seeks to impose any material legal restraint on or
prohibition against or limit the Surviving Corporations ability to operate
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries substantially as it
was operated prior to the date of this Agreement.

purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, preserving and renewing the
Registered Company Intellectual Property and its validity and enforceability.
Except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are
no actions that must be taken for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining,
perfecting, preserving or renewing any Registered Company Intellectual
Property within one hundred twenty (120) days following the date of this
Agreement, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal

To the knowledge of the Company, each item of Registered Company Intellectual
Property has been prosecuted in compliance with such rules, policies, and
procedures.

(c)  _Trademarks._ All Trademarks included in the Registered Company
Intellectual Property have been in continuous use sufficient to maintain the
registrability of such Trademarks in the form appearing in, and in connection
with the goods and services listed in, the applicable registration

the Owned Company Intellectual Property against third party infringement.

(d) _Rights to IP Ordered or Awarded._ Except to the extent set forth in
Section 4.14(d) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any decree, judgment, order, or

covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to any Intellectual
Property Rights.

(e) _No Proceedings._ Since June 1, 2006, no Registered Company Intellectual
Property is or has been involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,

been threatened.

(f) _Trade Secrets._ The Company and Company Subsidiaries have, in accordance
with the applicable Law of each relevant jurisdiction, taken commercially
reasonable steps to protect their rights in and to their Trade Secrets,
including by not making any disclosure  



 

\- 41 -  of Trade Secrets except under written confidentiality obligations (other
than former Trade Secrets intentionally publicly disclosed by the Company
without confidentiality obligations in its reasonable business judgment). To
the knowledge of the Company, there has been no misappropriation or
unauthorized disclosure of any material Trade Secret included in the Owned
Company Intellectual Property, which material Trade Secrets include all Trade
Secret embodied or used in Company Products. The Company and Company
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with and have not
breached in any material respect any contractual obligations to protect the
Trade Secrets of Third Parties in accordance with the terms of any Contracts
relating to such Third Party Trade Secrets.

(g)  _Employees, Consultants, and Contractors _

(i) The Company and Company Subsidiaries have and enforce policies requiring
each employee, consultant and contractor who is involved in the development
of any Company Products to execute proprietary information, confidentiality
and assignment agreements appropriate for the jurisdiction in which such
employees, officers, consultants, and contractors reside and provide
development services that, to extent permitted by applicable Law, assign to
the Company and/or a Company Subsidiary all Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by the employees, and, with
respect to consultants or contractors, all Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by the consultants or
contractors in the course of performing services for the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries, and that otherwise appropriately protect the
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights of the Company and any
Company Subsidiary and the Trade Secrets of Third Parties (each, a " _Employee
IP Agreement_ "). All present and former employees, officers, consultants and
contractors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who are involved in the
development of any Company Products have signed an appropriate Employee IP
Agreement, in a form substantially similar to, or with provisions with
substantially similar legal effect as the provisions of, the forms attached to
Section 4.14(g)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule with respect to proprietary
information, confidentiality, and assignment and licensing of Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights, and Section 4.14(g)(i) lists any
present and former employees, officers, consultants or contractors of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries involved in the development of any Company
Products who have not signed such agreements. No current employee, officer,
consultant or contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary involved in
the development of any Company Products and, to the knowledge of Company, no
former employee, officer, consultant or contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary involved in the development of any Company Products is in
default or breach of any term of any Employee IP Agreement or other,
employment or contractor agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment
agreement, or similar Contract relating to Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights entered into between such employee, officer,
consultant or contractor and the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with such individuals employment or other engagement with Company
or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries
has exclusively licensed any Registered Company Intellectual Property from
any Third Party. All assignments of Registered Company Intellectual Property
to Company or any Company Subsidiary have been duly executed and recorded with
the appropriate Governmental Authorities. No present or former
employee, officer, consultant or contractor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any ownership, license or other right, title or interest,
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any Owned Company Intellectual
 



 

\- 42 -  Property (other than to the extent any such individual has a non-exclusive
license to use Company Products granted by Company or a Company Subsidiary in
the ordinary course of business). Section 4.14(g)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all limitations of,
exceptions to, and exclusions and carve-outs from any employee assignment of
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights contained in any
Employee IP Agreement to the extent any such limitation, exception, and
exclusion or carve-out would reasonably be expected to be related to any
Company Product or other aspect of the business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Employee Retained IP_ "). No Employee
Retained IP is included in (or claimed or purported to be included in) any
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights included in any Company
Products (other than Employee Retained IP that is generally available to the
public under Open Source license terms).

(ii) There are no Contracts to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, or by which Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound, that
(a) prohibit or restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict) the free
movement of any current employee, contractor or other personnel of Company or
any Company Subsidiary who is involved in the development of any Company
Products within or among Companys or any Company Subsidiarys organization or
business units, or between Company or any Company Subsidiary and any
affiliate of Company or any Company Subsidiary, (b) prohibit or restrict (or
purport to prohibit or restrict) any current employee, contractor or other
personnel of Company or any Company Subsidiary who is involved in the
development of any Company Products from performing any services for or
working with any Third Party, or (c) prohibit or restrict (or purport to
prohibit or restrict) any current employee, contractor or other personnel of
Company or any Company Subsidiary who is involved in the development of any
Company Products from engaging in any activities or performing any work
related to any particular technology, product or other subject matter.

(h) _Enforceability, Validity of IP._ To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts, circumstances, or information, Intellectual Property,
or Intellectual Property Rights that would reasonably be expected to limit or
render invalid or unenforceable any of the Intellectual Property Rights
included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property (or provide any grounds
therefor). To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts,
circumstances, or information, Intellectual Property, or Intellectual Property
Rights that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, limit, restrict,
impair, or impede the ability of Surviving Corporation and the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to use and practice the Company Intellectual Property
from and after the Effective Date in substantially the same manner in which it
was used prior to the Effective Time. Since June 1, 2004, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received any Claim challenging or questioning
the validity or enforceability of any of the Registered Company Intellectual
Property or the Owned Copyrights, or indicating an intention on the part of
any person to bring a Claim that any of the foregoing is invalid, is
unenforceable or has been misused, other than any Claim finally resolved prior
to June 1, 2006. The Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned
Company Intellectual Property are subsisting and in full force and effect,
are valid and enforceable, and have not been abandoned or passed into the
public domain.

(i) _No Infringement or Misappropriation of Company IP._ To the knowledge of
the Company, no person is infringing, misappropriating, using or disclosing
without  



 

\- 43 -  authorization, or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property Rights owned
or exclusively licensed by Company or any Company Subsidiary, except to
the extent such violation consists only of a breach of a customer agreement
by the applicable customers exceeding the number of permitted licensed users
or licensed copies or other underpayment of license fees (a
"Compliance Violation"). Since June 1, 2006, neither Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has made any Claim with respect to infringement or misappropriation
of any Intellectual Property Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to
Company or any Company Subsidiary against any person, nor has Company or any
Company Subsidiary issued any written communication inviting any person to
take a license, authorization, covenant not to sue or the like with respect to
any such Intellectual Property Rights at any time since June 1, 2006 (other
than in connection with Compliance Violations). Since June 1, 2004, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice or Claim
challenging the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys exclusive ownership of
any Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned Company Intellectual
Property or suggesting that any other person has any claim of legal or
beneficial ownership with respect thereto (other than any Claim finally
resolved prior to June 1, 2006).

(j) _Infringement by Company._ None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
or any Company Product, infringes, misappropriates, uses or discloses without
authorization, or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any
person or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the Law of
any jurisdiction. Since June 1, 2004, Company and its Subsidiaries have not
received any Claim or notice of any related Action relating to any of the
foregoing and, to the knowledge of Company, there are no facts, circumstances
or information that would reasonably be expected to be the basis for such a
Claim (other than any Claim finally resolved prior to June 1, 2006). Since
June 1, 2004, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries has received
any written communication inviting the Company of its Subsidiaries to take a
license, authorization, covenant not to sue or the like with respect to
Intellectual Property Rights, other than in connection with licenses granted
to Company or the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and
not related to any infringement or other violation by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (other than any Claim finally resolved prior to June 1,
2006).

(k) _Ownership; Licenses._ Company and the Company Subsidiaries solely and
exclusively own all right, title and interest (including the sole right to
enforce) in and to the Owned Company Intellectual Property free and clear of
all Liens, and have not exclusively licensed (under any Contract in effect as
of the date of this Agreement) any such Owned Company Intellectual Property,
or any other Company Intellectual Property, to any person, and are under no
obligation to grant any such licenses. All of the Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights used (or held for use) by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that are not Owned Company Intellectual Property and are
used in any Company Products or in the development of any Company Products are
duly and validly licensed to Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary
pursuant to a valid and enforceable Contract, or Company and Company
Subsidiaries otherwise have a valid and enforceable right with respect to such
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights, for use in the manner
in which such Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights are used
in the conduct of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries businesses.
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will own or have
(pursuant to the Company Intellectual Property Agreements and  



 

\- 44 -  Companys and the Company Subsidiaries other Contracts) the same rights as
Company and the Company Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to all Company Intellectual Property and all other
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights used in any Company
Products or in the development of any Company Products.

(l) _Scheduled IP Agreements._ Section 4.14(l) of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of:

(i) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound,
that relate to any Intellectual Property Rights under which the Company or any

license, covenant, release, immunity, assignment, or other right with respect
to any Intellectual Property Rights (whether now existing or existing in the
future)

(ii) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound,

is a party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise
bound, that relate to any Intellectual Property Rights and are not otherwise
included in subsection (i) or (ii) above;

(iv) all other Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party that contain any license, covenant, release, immunity, assignment, or

in the future, except Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business pursuant to which Company or a Company Subsidiary has granted a
license with respect to Patents only for the limited use of a Company Product,
or (2) any Software (or Owned Copyrights related to Software) included in the
Owned Company Intellectual Property, whether now existing or existing in
the future, except Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business
pursuant to which Company or a Company Subsidiary has granted a license with
respect to Software only as incorporated into or for use in connection with a
Company Product, and (the Contracts in (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv),
collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property Agreements_ "). All Company
Intellectual Property Agreements are in full force and effect, and enforceable
in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally). The Company and each Company Subsidiary
is in material compliance with, and has not materially breached any term of,
any such Company Intellectual Property Agreements and, to the knowledge of
Company, all other parties to such Company Intellectual Property Agreements
are in material compliance with, and have not materially breached any term

of this Agreement or any Contracts, documents, or instruments to be executed
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or result in the breach,
material modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of, or
acceleration of any payments under, the Company Intellectual Property
Agreements (or give rise to any right with respect to any of the foregoing).

permitted to exercise all of Companys and the Company Subsidiaries rights
under the Company Intellectual Property Agreements (and will have the same
rights with respect to the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property

and been able to exercise, had this Agreement or any Contracts, documents, or
instruments to be executed by Company or its Subsidiaries after the date of
this Agreement not been entered into, and the Transactions not occurred,
without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than
ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Company and Company Subsidiaries
would otherwise have been required to pay anyway pursuant to the Company
Intellectual Property Agreements. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or any Contracts, documents, or instruments to
be executed by Company or its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Transactions, nor any Contract to which Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, will cause or require
(or purports to cause or require) the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any
of its Affiliates to (i) grant to any Third Party any license, covenant not to
sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under any Intellectual
Property Rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) be obligated to
pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to any Third Party
(except, in each of (i) and (ii), with respect to Surviving Corporation only,
royalties, other amounts, discounts, licenses, covenants not to sue,
immunities or other rights that Surviving Corporation would have had to pay,
offer or grant had this Agreement not been entered into and the Transaction
not been consummated).

Copyleft Open Source is incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, linked
to, used in the development or compilation of, or otherwise used in or with
any Company Run Time Product, and (iii) the Open Source license terms (and
version, if applicable) under which such Open Source is licensed or otherwise
obligated. No Company Run Time Product incorporates, is integrated or bundled
with, links to or is otherwise used with any Copyleft Open Source. Company

Products. Company and the Company Subsidiaries have used commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) identify all Open Source in any Company Product; and
(b) regulate the use and distribution of Open Source in compliance with the
applicable Open Source licenses. Any written Open Source policies of Company
and the Company Subsidiaries are listed in Section 4.14(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule, and complete and accurate copies thereof have been made available
to  



 

\- 46 -  Parent. There has been no material deviation from or violation of Companys

possession as of the date of this Agreement have been made available to
Parent.

(o) _Standards, SIGs._ Section 4.14(o) of the Disclosure Schedule contains
a list of all standards-setting organization, university or industry bodies
and consortia, and other multi-party special interest groups and activities in
which Company or any Company Subsidiary is currently participating, or in
which Company or any Company Subsidiary has participated in the past to the
extent that such past participation imposes or purports to impose any
continuing obligations on Company or any Company Subsidiary (or, following the

with respect to licensing or granting of any other Intellectual Property
Rights (other than licenses that survive with respect to the copyright in

substantially free of any material defects, bugs and errors in accordance with
generally accepted industry standards, and does not contain or make available
any disabling codes or instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or

disruption, impairment, disablement, or destruction of, Software, data or
other materials (" _Contaminants_ ").

systems, facilities and services used by the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, including all Software, hardware, networks, communications

"), are reasonably sufficient for the existing and currently anticipated
future needs of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, including as to
capacity, scalability and ability to process current and anticipated peak

effectively perform all computing, information technology and data processing
operations necessary for the operation of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable
safeguards to protect the Systems from Contaminants. The Systems, the
Companys and Company Subsidiaries procedures and processes for developing,
supporting and maintaining the Systems, and the applications programming
interfaces, protocols, data structures, command structures and other
interfaces with respect to the Systems are documented in a
commercially reasonable manner that would permit persons generally skilled in
the subject matter of such Systems (including applications therefor) (e.g.,
personnel experienced in the support of Software, maintenance of network
equipment, etc.) to  



 

\- 47 -  develop, support and maintain such Systems (including applications therefor)
in accordance with industry standards and without material disruption
or interruption or effect on performance. Except as set forth in Section
4.14(r) of the Disclosure Schedule, all Systems, other than Software that is
duly and validly licensed to the Company and Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
a valid and enforceable Contract, are owned and operated by and are under the
control of Company and the Company Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will have and be permitted to exercise the
same rights (whether ownership, license or otherwise) with respect to the
Systems as Company and the Company Subsidiaries would have had and been able
to exercise had this Agreement and such other Contracts, documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered after the date of this Agreement not
been entered into and the Transactions not occurred, without the payment of
any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or
payments which Company and Company Subsidiaries would otherwise have been
required to pay anyway (other than with respect to any Systems that are
generally commercially available on reasonable terms pursuant to "shrinkwrap"
or "clickwrap" license agreements).

4.15 Taxes.

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has filed all federal
Income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns that it was required to
file under applicable laws and regulations. All such Tax Returns as so filed
disclose all material Taxes required to be paid for the periods covered
thereby. All material Taxes due and owing by Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. There
are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable or
Taxes that are currently being contested in good faith and that have been
reserved for on the 2009 Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP) upon any
assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party
and all material Forms W-2 and 1099 required with respect thereto have been
properly completed and timely filed.

(b) There is no material dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries either (A) claimed or raised by any
authority in writing or (B) as to which there is any knowledge of the Company.

(c) Section 4.15(c) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all income Tax Returns
filed with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for taxable
periods ended on or after January 31, 2007, in material jurisdictions, as that
latter term was defined for purposes of Footnote 7 to the Companys
consolidated financial statements as set forth in Form 10-K for the period
ended January 31, 2009. Section 4.15(c) also indicates those income Tax
Returns with respect to taxable periods ended on or after January 31, 2003
filed in material jurisdictions that have been audited, and indicates those
income Tax Returns filed in material jurisdictions that currently are the
subject of audit. The Company has made available to Purchaser correct and
complete copies of all federal Income Tax Returns, examination reports, and
statements of deficiencies assessed against, or agreed to by the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries since January 31, 2006. Neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has waived  



 

\- 48 -  any statutes of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any claim made by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns, that the Company or a Company Subsidiary
is or may be required to file Tax Returns or to pay Taxes to that
jurisdiction.

(d) The Transactions (including the Offer and Merger) will not result in the
payment or series of payments by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to any person of an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code, or any similar payment, that is not deductible
for federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes. Additionally, there is no
contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party

280G of the Code, (ii) is subject to Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) could

are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through such date in accordance with
GAAP. Since the date of the 2009 Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice, and
the reserve set forth on the face of the 2009 Balance Sheet (rather than in
any notes thereto), as adjusted for the passage of time through the Effective
Time in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, is adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the
Effective Time in accordance with GAAP, excluding in each case any Taxes
arising from the Transactions.

(f) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has been included in any
"consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" Tax Return (other than Tax Returns for
which the Company is the common parent) provided for under the laws of the
U.S., any foreign jurisdiction or any state or locality with respect to Taxes

successor, by contract or otherwise.

either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a
corporation in the two years prior to the Effective Time) or that otherwise

meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code in conjunction with the Offer and the
Merger.

to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction

open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Effective Time, or (E)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Effective Time.

and for the past five years has been in material compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws; (b) to the knowledge of the Company, none of
the properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (including soils and surface and ground waters) are

Subsidiary is legally responsible for any unperformed investigation or
remediation costing in excess of $500,000 required by applicable law or any
Contract; (c) the Company and each Company Subsidiary possesses and is in
material compliance with all permits, licenses and other authorizations
required under any Environmental Law for the conduct of its operations in the
manner presently carried on by the Company or such Company Subsidiaries) ("

execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will
require any investigation, remediation, or other action with respect to
Hazardous Substances, or any notice to or consent of Governmental Authorities
or Third Parties, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws or
Environmental Permit. The Company has made available to Parent any and all
notice letters, written requests for information, and any other
written communication with or documentation from any Governmental Authorities
regarding the presence of Hazardous Materials on any properties currently or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Company and Company Subsidiaries have in place industry standard (and, in any

pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Purchaser
shall supply to the Company any information with respect to either of them and
their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the Company Board,
then until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to
have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date of
this Agreement, including at least two (2) directors who are (i) selected by
such current directors and (ii) independent directors for purposes of the
continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Stock Market (such
directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "), _provided_ , that, if any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any
other reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to elect
or designate another individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director
(or directors) on the date of this Agreement (provided that no such individual
is an employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) to fill the
vacancy, and such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two (2) individuals, _provided_ , that such individuals shall not
be employees, officers, directors or affiliates of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser (or, in the event that there shall be less than two (2) directors
available to fill the vacancies as a result of such individuals deaths,
disabilities or refusals to serve, such smaller number of individuals who are
directors on the date of this Agreement) to fill the vacancies and such
directors shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Following the Control Date and prior to the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, the approval of a majority of
the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any amendment
or termination of this Agreement on behalf of the Company, any extension by
the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations of
Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, or any waiver of compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the
Company, and any amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company that would adversely affect the ability of the Company to consummate
any of the Transactions. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to
retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) at the
expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations
hereunder, and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Date, to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.



 

\- 66 - 7.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors,
employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to, afford the officers, employees and other Representatives of Parent and
Purchaser reasonable access at all reasonable times to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books
and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, including the Owned
Company Intellectual Property, and shall furnish Parent and Purchaser with
such financial, operating and other data and information (including the work
papers of the Companys accountants) as Parent or Purchaser, through their
officers, employees and other Representatives, may reasonably request as long
as these actions are in compliance with all applicable
data privacy/protection Laws. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, make
available to Parent by posting and making accessible to Parent within the
Project Williamsburg 2009 workspace on the Merrill Corporation DataSite
related to this transaction (the "Data Room") a copy of each material internal
or external report prepared by, or on behalf of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as long as these actions are in compliance with all applicable
data privacy/protection Laws.

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.4 shall be held confidential in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated February 11, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between Parent and the Company.

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent in good faith on a regular basis as
requested by Parent to report material (individually or in the
aggregate) operational developments, the status of relationships with
customers and potential customers, the status of ongoing operations and other
matters reasonably requested by Parent.

(d) No investigation or consultation pursuant to this Section 7.4 or otherwise
shall affect any representation warranty, covenant or other agreement in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto or any condition to the Offer.

7.5 No Solicitation of Transactions.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of the Control
Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they
authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or the making thereof, (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish any information to, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, any person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than
Parent or its affiliates.

The Company immediately shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
shall instruct each of their respective Representatives immediately to, cease
and cause to be terminated any  



 

\- 67 -  and all discussions or negotiations with any person that may be ongoing with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information provided to any such party prior
to the date of this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure compliance with such request.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Acceptance Date,
in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal did
not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this Section
7.5(a) and was made after the date hereof, the Company may, subject to
compliance with Section 7.5(c), (x) furnish information regarding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which
shall permit the Company to comply with the terms of Section 7.5(c))
containing confidentiality and standstill provisions not less restrictive to
such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Parent; _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such action is
necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
_provided_ , the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless the Company shall have notified Parent in
writing at least three (3) business days prior to taking such action that it
intends to take such action and the basis hereunder therefor. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company may,
to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, not enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the
sole purpose of allowing the other party to such agreement to submit an
Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to another party that has submitted an
Acquisition Proposal, solely with respect to such submission, that will
constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did
not, in each case, result from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.5.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
written proposal, which did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of this Section 7.5, made by a Third Party that, if consummated, would
result in such Third Partys (or its stockholders) owning, directly or
indirectly, 100% of the equity securities of the Company (or of the shares of
the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith (in accordance
with written advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and its outside legal counsel) to be (1) more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Offer and the Merger
(taking into account all terms and conditions of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)),  



 

\- 68 -  (2) reasonably capable of being completed by such Third Party (taking into
account, among other things, the expectation of obtaining required
regulatory approvals without undue cost or delay), and (3) otherwise
reasonably likely to be completed (taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory, and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal), and (ii) is not subject to any due diligence or financing
condition (and if financing is required, such financing is then fully
committed to the Third Party).

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of the
Acceptance Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i)
(A) fail to make, or withdraw, modify, amend or qualify or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ "), (B) make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation (provided, however, that a public
statement limited solely to a brief factual description of an Acquisition
Proposal received after the date hereof that did not result from a breach by
the Company of this Section 7.5 shall not be deemed to constitute a Change in
Recommendation), (C) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer
or exchange offer other than the Offer for the Company Common Stock within ten
(10) business days of the commencement of such offer, (D) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(D), a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "), or (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.5(a)) (any of the
foregoing, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company Board may in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was
unsolicited and made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from
or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 7.5, (A) make a Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of the receipt of
such Superior Proposal, such Change in Recommendation is necessary to comply
with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law,
or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(f) and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition
Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of
such Superior Proposal, such termination is necessary to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless prior to such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the Fee in accordance with Section 9.1(f);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise
its right to make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the
Company has:

(A) provided to Parent five (5) business days prior written notice written
notice that it intends to take a such action (a " _Notice of Designated
Superior Proposal_ "), which notice shall describe the terms and conditions of
any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board (a " _Designated Superior Proposal_ ") and attach the most current form
or draft of any written agreement providing for the transaction
contemplated by such Designated Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Designated Superior
Proposal and a new five (5) business day period),



 

\- 69 - (B) during such five (5) business day period, if requested by Parent, engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and

(C) at the end of such five (5) business day period, such Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in response to a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal, as a result
of the negotiations required by clause (B) or otherwise).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in
writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the
avoidance of doubt any request for information or other inquiry in connection
with or which reasonably could be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal), including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any such written
Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to
the Company, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any such
request or other inquiry). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed in
all material respects of the status and details (including any change or
proposed change to the terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice
as is provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the
Company Board at which the Company Board is expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider providing information
to any person or group in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any such
inquiry. The Company shall publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) business days of the commencement of any tender or exchange
offer or public announcement or public notice of an Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party, after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such
reaffirmation, unless a Change in Recommendation is permitted by Section
7.5(b). 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (i) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by  



 

\- 70 -  Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any such disclosure,
other than a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be in a Change in
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such communication; or (ii) disclosing
information to the stockholders of the Company to the extent that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that such disclosure is necessary to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) Unless such actions are taken in connection with a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(f), the Company shall not take any
action to exempt any person from the Rights Agreement or otherwise cause the
Rights Agreement not to apply to any person or to approve any Transaction
under, or any third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL other than as contemplated by Section 4.25 of this Agreement.

7.6 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) If so directed by Parent, the Company Board, at least ten (10) business
days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, will adopt
resolutions terminating any and all Plans intended to qualify as a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member
of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of
the Code) as Parent. The Company Board shall in any case adopt resolutions
effective at the Effective Time eliminating Company stock as the funding
vehicle for matching contributions under any such Plan. The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent,
and the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably
request.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any respect,
including in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment),
or create any such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Plan or any employee
program or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any
Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time), or (y) constitute or be
construed to constitute an amendment to any of the compensation or benefit
plans maintained for or provided to employees or other persons prior to or
following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a
limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any such plans or
arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the
Company prior to the Effective Time).

(c) If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts,
amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such
amounts payable under such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted
as compensation for past services  



 

\- 71 -  performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be
refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters
incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of
shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered
Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall take all actions necessary so
that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or
modification of each such Company Arrangement shall be approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the
Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Company
Compensation Committee or its independent directors.

(d) The Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and in
accordance with applicable Laws, amend the Executive Officers Change of
Control Incentive and Severance Benefit Plan and the Vice Presidents
Severance Benefit Plan effective immediately prior to the Acceptance Date to
provide that (a) from and after the Acceptance Date no compensation will be
payable, and no benefits will be triggered under such plans, in connection
with the termination of employment of any participant for "good reason,"
"constructive termination" or any term of similar import, and (b) no provision
of such plans shall result in the acceleration of vesting, exercisability or
settlement of any stock option, restricted stock unit or other equity based
award that is not outstanding at the Effective Time. The Company may also (a)
amend the Executive Officers Change of Control Incentive and Severance
Benefit Plan to include commissions and MBO payments in the definition of
"compensation" used to calculate benefits payable under such plan, and (b)
amend the Executive Officers Change in Control Incentive and Severance
Benefit Plan to provide that from the Effective Time until the first
anniversary of the Effective Time Parent may not, and may not cause the
Surviving Company to, terminate the Executive Officers Change of Control
Incentive and Severance Benefit Plan or to amend such plan to reduce the
benefits payable or potentially payable to eligible employees employed at the
Effective Time under the terms of such plan in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The form and substance of these amendments (which
shall be the exclusive amendments to the plans without the further consent of
Parent) shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company
shall provide Parent evidence that such amendments have been adopted by the
Company Board, the compensation committee of the Company Board, or the board
of directors of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable. Section 7.6(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the countries, which do not include the
United States, in which applicable Laws prohibit or limit the Companys
ability to make the amendments described in this Section 7.6(d) and describes
the nature of the prohibition or limitation in each such country.

7.7 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For six years after the Acceptance Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now or
was prior to the Effective Date an officer or director of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries and each person who is now or was prior to the Effective
Date an officer or director of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who
served as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
 



 

\- 72 -  ERISA) (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ , that such advance shall be conditioned upon the Surviving
Companys receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person
to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined by final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.7(a)), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or
investigation in respect of or arising out of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, based in whole or
in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is
or was an officer or director of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries. In the event of any such action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the
defense of any such action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries set forth in Section 7.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") (and all other indemnification
agreements of the Company that are on terms substantially similar to the
Indemnification Agreements) and any indemnification, exculpation or
advancement of expenses provisions under the certificates of incorporations
or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such obligations shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide officers and directors liability,
fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_")
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the
Companys DandO Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person
under ERISA; provided, that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section
7.7(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in the aggregate in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has
disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, and prior to
the Acceptance Date, the Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy, covering the same
persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and amount as
aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual
anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such
insurance Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 7.7(c) shall be deemed satisfied for so
long as such insurance is in full force and effect.



 

\- 73 - (d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

7.8 Takeover Laws and Rights. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute or regulation (" _Takeover
Law_ ") is or may become applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreement, the Company Shares, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Company Shares,
the Offer, the Merger or such other Transactions.

7.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, becoming aware that any representation
or warranty made by it in this Agreement is untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, (b) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event,
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be expected to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or cause any covenant, condition or
agreement of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, under this Agreement
not to be complied with or satisfied and (c) any failure of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; and
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other
communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or
may be required in connection with any of the Transactions;  _provided_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

7.10 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the
legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or any
Transaction. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the others of any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation that may be threatened or asserted in
writing, brought or commenced against the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, that would have been
listed in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule or Section 5.6 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, if such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate at Parents expense in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation or claims against the Company or any
of its directors relating to the Offer or the Merger. The  



 

\- 74 -  Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle any litigation against
the Company or any director by any stockholder relating to this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger without the prior written consent of Parent.

7.11 Consents and Approvals.

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (x) prepare and file all necessary documentation and (y) effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act, as more specifically
addressed in Section 7.12) and (y) obtain all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions. The Company shall also
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents required to be listed
on Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. The parties hereto shall consult
with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations, and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions. Parent and
the Company shall each, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Parent and the Company, with respect to any threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or
ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely
affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

7.12 HSR Act Filing and International Antitrust Notifications.

(a) As promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement, if required by

9.3 Fees.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

\- 79 - _then_ , in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent a fee of Thirty
Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (the " _Fee_ "), which amount shall be payable
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Fee shall be paid (x) in
the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) above, promptly (but in no
event later than one (1) business day) following the first to occur of the
entry into of such definitive agreement and consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal, (y) in the circumstances described in clause (iii) above, promptly
(but in no event later than one (1) business day) following termination, and
(z) in the circumstances described in clause (iv) above, prior to and as a
condition to the termination.

(b) Subject to Section 9.3(c), all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement and the Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is
consummated.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and
neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material breach of their respective
agreements contained in this Agreement or their respective representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company shall, reimburse each of
Parent and Purchaser and their affiliates for all out-of-pocket expenses and
fees (including fees and expenses payable to all banks, investment banking
firms, other financial institutions and other persons and their respective
agents and counsel, for arranging, committing to provide or providing any
financing for the Transactions or structuring the Transactions and all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent and
Purchaser, and all printing and advertising expenses) actually incurred or
accrued by either of them or on their behalf in connection with the
Transactions, including the financing thereof, and actually incurred or
accrued by banks, investment banking firms, other financial institutions and
other persons and assumed by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the
structuring and financing of the Transactions and any financing commitments
or agreements relating thereto in an amount not to exceed Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) (all the foregoing being referred to herein collectively as the "
_Expenses_ "). The Expenses shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds promptly following submission of statements therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its
affiliates that the Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in
the circumstances in which the Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that
the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Transactions,
and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay the Fee or the
Expenses when due, the terms " _Fee_ " and " _Expenses_ ", as applicable,
shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred or accrued by
Parent and Purchaser (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection
with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.3, together with
interest on such unpaid Fee and Expenses, commencing on the date that the Fee
and Expenses became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank, N.A from time to time, in the City of New York, as such
banks Base Rate plus 5%.
