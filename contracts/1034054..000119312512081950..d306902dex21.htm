amount of $3,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price Escrow Amount_ ") and a portion
of the Stock Consideration equal to a number of shares of Stock Consideration
equal to $81,771,937 (valued at the SBA Average Closing Price) (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") and the same shall be subject to reduction
on the six-month anniversary of the Closing pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
(the accounts into which such amounts are deposited, the " _Purchase Price
Escrow Account_ " and the " _Indemnification Escrow Account,_ "
respectively). The Purchase Price Escrow Account shall be used to exclusively
satisfy amounts payable to Buyer, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.6_, and,
other than as provided in _Section 2.6(g)_, the Indemnification Escrow
Account shall be used to exclusively satisfy any claims of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ made
from and after Closing but on or before the expiration of the Escrow Period.
Any funds or Escrow Shares in the Purchase Price Escrow Account or the
Indemnification Escrow Account not so used shall be distributed to Sellers,
pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Section C_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be adjusted by Sellers
pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

 



26 (b) The Parties agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) the right of the Sellers
to the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Amount
shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for
installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provision of foreign, state or local law, as appropriate; (ii) if and to the
extent any amount of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount is actually distributed to the Sellers, interest may be imputed
on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; (iii) Buyer
shall be treated as the owner of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to
Buyer pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code; and (iv) in no event shall the
total amount of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, and any interest and earnings earned thereon paid to the
Sellers under this Agreement exceed an amount to be designated by the Sellers
prior to the Closing. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended
to ensure that the right of the Sellers to the Purchase Price Escrow Amount
and the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and any interest and earnings earned
thereon is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum
selling price under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

2.4 _Tax Treatment of Transactions_. 

(a) Parent, Buyer, the Companies, Sellers, and each of their Affiliates and
Subsidiaries shall treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
all federal income Tax purposes and file all federal income Tax Returns
consistently with and in the order provided in the Recitals, Exhibits A, B, C
and D, _Section 2.2_ and this  _Section 2.4_.

(b) Parent and Buyer, based on the Sellers representations, and Sellers
acknowledge that because each of MPGJ I, MPGJ II, MPMA I, Mobilitie I and
Mobilitie II will be treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, Buyers purchase of interests in the foregoing entities from
Sellers is properly viewed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a purchase
of the underlying assets owned by each such entity directly from each Seller,
as applicable, in exchange for a payment to each Seller of its share of the
Final Purchase Price plus the amount of assumed liabilities (that are treated
as liabilities of each Seller for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of the
assets sold by each Seller.

(c) The amount of the Final Purchase Price plus assumed liabilities (that are
treated as liabilities for U.S. federal income tax purposes) shall be
allocated:

 

(i) first, among Sellers in a manner consistent with _Section 2.1(a)_, which
allocation shall be conclusive and binding and not subject to the remaining
provisions of this _Section 2.4(c)_, and

 



27 (ii) second, the amount allocated to each Seller pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)(i)_ shall be further allocated, with respect to each Seller, among the
assets deemed sold by each Seller (in accordance with _Section 2.4(b))_ based
upon the fair market values thereof in accordance with the values set forth
on  _Schedule 2.4(c)(ii)_, as adjusted for adjustments to the Purchase Price
after the Closing in a manner mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Sellers, but
consistent with _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Schedule 2.4(c)(ii)_. If Buyer and
the Oaktree Sellers and the MP Sellers, as applicable, are unable, within
fifteen (15) calendar days to resolve any disputes regarding the allocation of
adjustments to the Purchase Price among the assets, such disputed items will
be referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Neutral Accounting Firm_ "). The
Neutral Accounting Firm shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, deliver to
Buyer and the Oaktree Sellers and the MP Sellers, as applicable, a written
report setting forth its determination as to such disputed items (and only
such disputed items), and such determination will be conclusive and binding
upon Buyer and Sellers. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall address only those
items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for
such item claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer (or, at its election, the Companies or Company Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed
items submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Neutral Accounting
Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted. For
example, if Buyer challenges the calculation of the allocation of
the Purchase Price by an amount of $100,000, but the Neutral Accounting Firm
determines that Buyer has a valid claim for only $40,000, Sellers shall bear
40% of the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm and Buyer (or, at
its election, the Companies or Company Subsidiaries) shall bear the other 60%
of such fees and expenses.

(iii) Each of Parent, Buyer and Sellers shall (A) act in a manner consistent
with the final allocation determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ in the
preparation of financial statements and the filing of all Tax Returns, (B) not
voluntarily take any position inconsistent therewith in the course of any Tax
audit or other proceeding, unless required to do so by applicable Laws
(including a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code
(or any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign law)), and (C)
provide the other promptly with any other information reasonably required to
timely complete IRS Form 8594, if applicable.

2.5 _Closing Transactions_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement:

(a) the Companies, by directing Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, shall
pay, release, discharge, remove, terminate, or cause to be paid, released,
discharged, removed or terminated, all Indebtedness outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing, including the Existing Indebtedness, and any
Construction Liabilities outstanding and due and payable as of the Closing
Date other than those which are the subject of a bona fide dispute (it being
acknowledged, however, that the discharge of record of Liens securing the
Existing Indebtedness will occur after the Closing);

 



28 (b) Mobilitie Partners II shall pay (or cause to be paid) Promissory Note I
and Promissory Note II in full and, upon payment, (i) Askelson and Jabara
shall cause Promissory Note I to be cancelled and the makers of Promissory
Note I to be released and (ii) Mobilitie II shall cause Promissory Note II
to be cancelled and the makers of Promissory Note II to be released; and

(c) each of Mobilitie I, Mobilitie II, MPGJ I, MPGJ II and MPMA I shall
distribute to the Sellers that are members thereof as of the Closing 100% of
its unrestricted cash or cash equivalents on hand.

2.6 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "),
which shall include a good faith calculation of (i) the Closing Date Payables
Amount, (ii) the Closing Date Receivables Amount, (iii) the Closing Date Real
Estate Prorations, and (iv) the Incomplete Tower Holdback Amount, if any,
along with reasonable supporting documentation used in the preparation of the
Closing Statement.

 

(b) In the event Buyer notifies Sellers of any objection to the Closing
Statement prior to the Closing, then Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such objection(s) prior to the Closing Date; _provided_
, that if the parties are unable to resolve such objection(s) prior to the
Closing Date, then the Closing Date Payables Amount, the Closing
Date Receivables Amount, the Closing Date Real Estate Prorations and the
Incomplete Tower Holdback Amount set forth in the Closing Statement shall be
used for the purpose of calculating of the Purchase Price as of the Closing
pursuant to  _Section 2.2_ (such Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing
Statement or adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_, the " _Closing
Purchase Price_ ") and such objection(s) shall be resolved as set forth in 
_Section 2.6(c)_.

(c) If the parties were unable to resolve any objection(s) to the Closing
Statement prior to the Closing Date or, if within sixty (60) calendar days
following the Closing Date, Buyer objects to the Closing Statement by written
notice to the Sellers, which notice shall set forth Buyers objections and
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any objections so asserted (the "
_Objections Statement_ "), Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any such objection(s) as promptly as possible. If Buyer and Sellers
are unable to resolve any such dispute within ninety (90) calendar days (or
such longer period as Buyer and Sellers shall mutually agree in writing) of
the Closing Date, such dispute and each partys submissions related thereto
shall be submitted to and resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_
by the Neutral Accounting Firm. Buyer and Sellers shall use reasonable efforts
to cause the Neutral Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving
the matters submitted to the Neutral Accounting Firm within 30 calendar days
of the making of such submission. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall consider
only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement.
The Neutral Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on written
submissions and presentations by Buyer and Sellers and their respective
representatives and not by independent review. The Neutral Accounting Firm

 



29  shall address only those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be
entered upon the determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall
be allocated among Buyer and Sellers in the same manner as set forth in
_Section 2.4(c)(ii)_.

(d) The Closing Statement and the corresponding Closing Purchase Price (if
Buyer does not provide an Objections Statement within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date) or as adjusted to reflect the resolution of
Buyers objections (as agreed upon by Sellers or as determined by the Neutral
Accounting Firm) (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") shall be final, conclusive
and binding on all of the parties.

(e) Until the date the Closing Statement becomes final, conclusive and
binding, in the event Buyer takes any actions, or causes the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries to take any actions, with respect to any account books
and records on which the Closing Statement is based that would reasonably be
expected to change any component of the Closing Statement from what such
component would have been absent such action, no action shall affect
the Closing Statement for purposes of this _Section 2.6_, unless such action
is taken to correct a mistake in the classification of an item as a receivable
or payable in the Closing Statement.

 

(f) If, after taking into account the adjustments contemplated by _Section
2.6(c)_, the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Purchase Price
(such excess, the " _Company Adjustment Amount_ "), then Parent and Buyer
shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) deliver to
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Section
C_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be adjusted by
Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to accounts designated by Sellers, an
amount equal to the Company Adjustment Amount.

(g) If, after taking into account the adjustments contemplated by  _Section
2.6(c)_, the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Purchase Price
(such shortfall, the " _Buyer Adjustment Amount_ "), then the Sellers and
Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly (but in any event within
five Business Days following the determination of the Final Purchase Price)
deliver from the Purchase Price Escrow Account to Buyer the Buyer Adjustment
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by Buyer in writing, and the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow
Account to Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in
_Section C_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be
adjusted by Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Sellers in writing. To the extent that the Buyer Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, then Buyer shall be entitled to be reimbursed
from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (in the case of Escrow Shares, based on
the SBA Average Closing Price) without regard to the Basket Amount.

 



30 2.7 _Apportionment of Real Estate Income and Expenses_.

 

(a) With respect to each Tower, Tower Site, DAS Asset and DAS Site,
appropriate prorations shall be made as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date with respect to (i) rental and
lease payments (but not one time payments made in connection with Ground Lease
Buyouts or Communications Easements), (ii) Real Estate Taxes and
Personal Property Taxes, (iii) utilities, and (iv) all other items of income
and expense due or payable under any Ground Lease or Tenant Lease, in each
case, of a nature ordinarily prorated as of closing in real estate
transactions (and not separately addressed elsewhere in this Agreement),
including all items of income and expense that are prepaid or payable in
arrears, any unbilled costs and fees and related accounts, notes and other
receivables, to the extent not reimbursed or reimbursable by an Anchor Tenant
(it being understood that Sellers shall be entitled to all such income
required to be paid for all periods (or portions thereof) prior to the Closing
Date and shall be responsible for all such expenses covering all periods (or
portions thereof) prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer being entitled to all
such income required to be paid for all periods on or subsequent to the
Closing Date and responsible for all such expenses of the Company Assets being
conveyed for all periods (or portions thereof) on or subsequent to the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Real Estate Prorations_ ")). In addition to
the foregoing, (1) Sellers shall receive a credit for 100% of each of the
security deposits held by Ground Lessors or utility companies to the extent
that the relevant Company or Company Subsidiary has provided Buyer
confirmation from the Ground Lessor or utility company of the amount of such
deposit and (2) Buyer shall receive a credit for 100% of the deposits owed to
Tenants held by the Companies or a Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Sellers shall be entitled to a
credit under _Section 2.7(a)_ for its share (determined or provided in the
first sentence of this _Section 2.7(a)_) of all rental and other amounts
payable under the Tenant Leases which have not yet been collected on the
Closing Date, so long as such amounts do not constitute Overdue Receivables.

(b) With respect to that portion of the rents and other lease payments under
the Tenant Leases which are billed on an estimated basis during the fiscal or
other period for which paid (the " _Estimated Rents_ "), (i) after any
determination that there has been, with respect to any Tenant, an overbilling
or underbilling of Estimated Rents for either of the fiscal years ending on
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 the Sellers shall, within twenty (20)
days after request by Parent or Buyer accompanied by reasonably detailed
evidence of any such overbilling, pay to Buyer from the Purchase Price Escrow
Account the portion of the overbilled amount which is properly allocable to
the period prior to the Closing Date, and promptly thereafter Buyer shall
cause the entire overbilled amount to be reimbursed to such Tenant. If there
has been an underbilling with respect to any such Estimated Rent, Buyer shall
bill, or cause to be billed, the amount of such underbilling to the applicable
Tenant, and any payment received by Buyer or the Companies on
account thereof, net of costs of collection, if any, to the extent properly
allocable to the periods prior to the Closing Date shall promptly be paid by
Buyer or the Companies to the Sellers pro rata based on the percentages set
forth on  _Section C_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that
Sellers shall be permitted to manage the process of calculating and collecting
directly

 



31  from the applicable Tenant any such underbillings for the fiscal year ending
on December 31, 2011. Buyer shall, with respect to Estimated Rents for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, after the determination of any such
overpayment or underpayment, promptly advise the Sellers of the same, and
shall promptly respond to any inquiries made by any Seller regarding the same.

 

2.8 _Payments Upon Incomplete Towers Becoming Completed_. With respect to any
Tower that was an Incomplete Tower as of the Closing Date, if Mobilitie LLC
(i) has received a Completed Tower Notice, (ii) has all permits and approvals,
including a certificate of occupancy or the equivalent where needed and (iii)
the Tower is stacked to its full planned height and in accordance with its 2C
certification (if located in the U.S.), then Mobilitie LLC shall deliver to
Buyer (1) a certificate (the " _Completed Tower Certificate_ ") certifying (a)
that such Tower is a Completed Tower or (b) setting forth the items necessary
to be completed in order for such Tower to be a Completed Tower and an
estimate of the amounts necessary to complete such items (the " _Remaining
Tower Completion Expenses_ "), (2) a copy of the Completed Tower Notice for
the subject Tower, and (3) evidence that all Construction Liabilities for such
Tower (other than Remaining Tower Completion Expenses) have been paid in full.
The Completed Tower Certificate shall be deemed a certification that all
representations and warranties of the Companies made with respect to such
Tower, the applicable Ground Lease and the applicable Tenant Leases in
_Sections 5.6_, _5.10(a)_ and _(b)_ , _5.11_ ,  _5.15_ , _5.19_ (except for
the second sentence of _Section 5.19(b)_), _5.20(a)_ and _(b)_ , _5.21_ and
_5.23_ (the " _Tower Related Representations_ ") are true and correct as of
the date of the Completed Tower Certificate, which representations and
warranties shall be subject to the provisions of _Article X_. No later than
fifteen Business Days following the delivery of such Completed Tower
Certificate, Buyer and Parent shall pay in immediately available funds to the
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Section C_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be adjusted by the
Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), the Incomplete Tower
Holdback Amount for such Tower less the amount of the Remaining Tower
Completion Expenses, if any. To the extent that Mobilitie LLC has received a
Completed Tower Notice, but those items set forth in (ii) and (iii) above are
not true as of the date of receipt of such Completed Tower Notice, then the
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth on _Section C_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be adjusted by the
Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), shall be entitled to
receive from Buyer the Tower Cash Flow for such Tower until the earlier of (x)
the date Mobilitie LLC delivers the Completed Tower Certificate and
Sellers receive the Incomplete Tower Holdback Amount for such Tower (less the
amount of the Remaining Tower Completion Expenses, if any) and (y) six months
from the date of receipt of such Completed Tower Notice. Buyer shall remit
such Tower Cash Flow within fifteen Business Days from the date it is
received. Upon any Incomplete Tower becoming a Completed Tower, such Tower
shall cease to be an "Incomplete Tower" for purposes of this Agreement. Upon
evidence that the remaining items identified as incomplete have been
completed, the Buyer and Parent shall pay in immediately available funds to
the Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Section
C_ (which percentages may be adjusted by the Sellers pursuant to the Sellers
Letter Agreement) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the applicable Remaining
Tower Completion Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to

 



32  complete a Tower within the timeframes set forth in the Construction
Management Agreement shall not, by itself, be deemed to negate Buyers
obligations to pay the Incomplete Tower Holdback Amount upon receipt of the
applicable Completed Tower Certificate.

2.9 _Collection of Overdue Receivables_. On and after the Closing, Buyer and
the Companies shall remit to the Sellers payments on any Overdue Receivables
received by the Companies or Company Subsidiaries and any other receivables
which arose prior to the Closing to the extent Buyer has not already paid for
such receivable. In addition, the Sellers may collect for their own account
such Overdue Receivables on behalf of Buyer or the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries, in which case the Sellers shall be entitled to retain any
amounts received in respect of such Overdue Receivables and Buyer shall cause
the Companies or Company Subsidiaries to endorse any checks over to the
Sellers and otherwise take all similar actions necessary to provide the
Sellers with the proceeds of such Overdue Receivables. Promptly, and in no
event later than thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any Overdue
Receivables or such other overdue amounts, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
applicable Company or Company Subsidiary to, pay the amount received to the
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Section C_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be adjusted by the
Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the Sellers. The
parties will work in good faith to determine to which period any monies
received correspond.

2.10 _Restrictions on Resale_. Except pursuant to a Marketed Secondary
Offering or an Approved Block Trade, prior to the six-month anniversary of the
Closing (the " _Restricted Period_ ") each Seller agrees not to offer, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, in excess of such
Sellers pro rata share in accordance with the percentages set forth in
_Section D_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which percentages may be
adjusted by Sellers pursuant to the Sellers Letter Agreement) 200,000 shares
of Stock Consideration in any one trading day. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Seller Fund may at any time after the Closing transfer or distribute all
or a portion of its Stock Consideration to its ultimate parent fund
entity(ies); _provided_ , that such Persons shall be deemed " _Seller Funds_ "
for purposes of this _Section 2.10_.

2.11 _Restrictive Legend_.

(a) Each certificate issued pursuant to this Agreement representing the Stock
Consideration shall have the following legend:

"The securities represented by this certificate are subject to certain
restrictions on transfer specified in _Section 2.10_ of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of February 18, 2012 by and among by and among Monarch
Towers Acquisition, LLC, a Florida limited

(b) In connection with any sale, transfer or distribution of any Stock
Consideration by any Seller in accordance with _Section 2.10_, Parent agrees
promptly to cause its transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend on stock
certificates representing shares of Stock Consideration sold, transferred or
distributed to the transferees and if necessary to instruct its counsel to
promptly issue an opinion confirming to the transfer agent the right to have
such legend removed.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF SELLERS

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule which is being delivered to
Buyer concurrently herewith (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (whether or not an explicit cross-reference appears) shall be deemed
to be disclosure with respect to any other section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and any other representation or warranty made elsewhere in _Article
IV_, in either case, to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), each Seller severally and not jointly ( _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not limit Buyers remedies following the Closing set forth in
_Section 10.2_) represents and warrants to Buyer and Parent as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Such Seller is a limited liability
company duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, or, in the case of Mobilitie LLC, under the
laws of the State of Nevada, and has all requisite limited liability company
power and authority and has taken all action required to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.

4.2 _Due Authorization; Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by such Seller and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Buyer and the
other Sellers, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms
except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by (a)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent 

 



36  conveyance and other similar laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (b) general principles of
equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). Upon the execution and delivery
by such Seller of the Ancillary Agreements to which such Seller is a party,
such Ancillary Agreements will constitute the legal, valid, and binding
obligations of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida.
Each of Parent and Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority and
has taken all action required to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent and Buyer has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry

power to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreement to

Exceptions. Upon the execution and delivery by each of Parent and Buyer of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Parent or Buyer is a party, such Ancillary

and Buyer, as the case may be, enforceable against Parent and Buyer in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions.

result in a violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of

approvals, orders, authorizations, permits or actions of, or make any
declaration, registration or filing with or give any notices to, any
Governmental Authorities or any other Person; (c) violate or result in the

(ii) any Buyer Permits.

 

6.9 _Legal Proceedings and Orders_. Other than set forth on _Section 6.9_ of
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, there is no Litigation pending to which a
Parent or Buyer is a party, or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, threatened,
against or affecting any of Parent or Buyer or any of their respective
Property. There is no Litigation to which a Buyer or Parent is a party which

respective Property is subject to any Order or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
any investigation of Parent or Buyer, by any Governmental Authority that
relates to the Business, or any of the Property owned or used by Parent or
Buyer, or that challenges or that could materially delay or materially impair
Parents or Buyers ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.

6.10 _Independent Investigation_. Each of Parent and Buyer hereby:

(a) acknowledges that none of Sellers, the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives makes any
representation or warranty, either express or implied as to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the

 



62  information provided or made available to Parent, Buyer or their respective
Representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement except as expressly
set forth in _Article IV_ or  _Article V_; and

(b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that none of the Sellers,
the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives will have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent
or Buyer on any basis (including in contract or tort, under applicable
securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided (including
in any management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum,
certain "data rooms" maintained by the Companies, supplemental information or
other materials or information with respect to any of the above) or made
available, or statements made, to Parent or Buyer, including information,
documents, projections, forecasts, other forward-looking information or other
material made available to Parent, Buyer, their respective Affiliates
or Representatives in connection with their due diligence investigation,
unless any such information is expressly and specifically included in a
representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or _Article V_.

6.12 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) Parent has filed with the SEC true and complete copies of all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and any definitive proxy or information
statements required to be filed by Parent pursuant to the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2008 (the " _SEC Filings_ "), each of which has complied in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as in effect on the date so filed, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing
filed or furnished to the SEC by Parent and in either case, publicly available
prior to February 8, 2012 or as set forth in _Section 6.12(a)_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule. None of the SEC Filings (including, any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein)
contained when filed, and any SEC Filings filed with the SEC subsequent to the
date hereof will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or
corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent SEC Filing filed on or prior to the date hereof, all of the
financial statements included in the SEC Filings, in each case, including any
related notes

 



63  thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively
referred to as the " _Parent Financial Statements_ "), have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
the unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and
subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit
adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate). The consolidated balance sheets (including
the related notes) included in such Parent Financial Statements (if
applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent SEC
Filing) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such
Parent Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods
indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-
end audit adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate.

 

(c) Parent has designed and maintains a system of "internal controls over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

 

(d) The management of Parent has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent by others within those entities, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to
Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of
Parent (A) all significant deficiencies and material weakness in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting. Neither Parent nor any of its
consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any kind
whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute,
that are material to Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2011, including the notes thereto, contained in the SEC
Filings, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of Buyer in
connection with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2011, and (iv) other liabilities or obligations that are not otherwise
covered by insurance that were not, and could not reasonably be expected to
be, material and adverse to the financial condition, businesses, results of
operations, properties or assets of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



64 6.13 _Status under the Securities Act_. At the time of filing the
Registration Statement, and at the time of each post-effective amendment
thereto, including by way of a _Section 10.3(a)(3)_ post-effective amendment,
Parent (i) was a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act) and (ii) was not an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act).

 

6.14 _Private Placement_. No registration under the Securities Act is required
for the offer and sale of the Stock Consideration by Parent to the Sellers as
contemplated hereby.

6.15 _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Parent Common Stock
is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Parent has
taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the
effect of, terminating the registration of the Parent Common Stock under the
Exchange Act nor has Parent received any notification that the SEC is
contemplating terminating such registration. Parent has not, in the 12 months
preceding the date hereof, received notice from Nasdaq or any trading market
on which Parent Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to the effect
that Parent is not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements
of such trading market. Parent is in compliance with all such listing and
maintenance requirements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement do not violate the Marketplace Rules of the
Nasdaq Stock Market.

Closing, the Companies shall pay all expenses incurred by the Companies in

Contemplated Transactions, and to cooperate with each other in connection
with the foregoing and (ii) refrain from taking, or cause to be refrained

restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and (2) effect all
necessary registrations and filings, including filings and submissions of
information requested or required by any Governmental Authority; provided,
however, that nothing shall prevent either party from engaging in practices
and transactions in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices. The parties hereto further covenant and agree, with respect to any
threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.5_ (including
_Section 7.5(c)_ ), no party hereto shall be obligated to pay any
consideration (or grant any other accommodation) to any third party from whom

and the Sellers to obtain, prior to Closing, any of the consents, waivers or

Notices_ "), including any Consents and Notices required under any Material
Contract, any of the DAS Agreements, the Ground Leases or the Tenant Leases,
(each of which are set forth in _Section 5.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule). If any of the Consents and Notices are not obtained or delivered
prior to the Closing, then, from the date of this Agreement through the
twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, or shall
cause their agents to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
Consents and Notices as soon as practicable after the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that the failure to obtain any Consents and Notices
shall not be a condition to the Closing unless the failure, in the aggregate
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

 



70   _provided, further_ , that the Parent and Buyer shall have the right to
recover in accordance with _Article X_ any Losses incurred by the Parent or
Buyer resulting from any Consents and Notices that are not obtained. This

governed exclusively by _Section 7.5(d)_ below. While it shall be the
responsibility of the Sellers, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries to
obtain all required consents in accordance with this _Section 7.5(c)_, Parent
and Buyer shall assist the Sellers, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries
to obtain such consents. In addition, the Sellers shall be responsible for
causing any Liens securing any Existing Indebtedness to be discharged of
record reasonably promptly after the Closing Date at their expense.

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Companies
and Mobilitie LLC shall cooperate and assist Buyer and Parent to obtain

shall enter into such agreements or take any other actions, in each case, that
may be reasonably requested by the New York City Department of Information
Technology and Telecommunications (" _DoITT_ ") pending the receipt of such
Franchise Consent at its sole expense to facilitate the approval of the change

(e) On or prior to the Closing, the Companies shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of all rights, title and interests
in and to Mobilitie Nicaragua held by a third party to Mobilitie Networks II,
LLC and to have such holder execute a full and complete release of Mobilitie
Nicaragua, Mobilitie Networks II, LLC and Mobilitie II.

to the extent assignable without consent. If any of such Contracts are not

from the date of this Agreement through the twelve-month anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer such Contracts to a Company or Company Subsidiary as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date.

 



71 7.6 _Access to Information and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 7.6(b)_, the Companies shall, subject to
(i) contractual and legal restrictions applicable to them, including attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege, (ii) any
confidentiality obligation of such parties existing as of the date hereof,
(iii) the terms of this Agreement and (iv) applicable Law, afford Parent and
Buyer and their Representatives at Parents sole cost and expense reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to all
of the properties, personnel, contracts and agreements, books and records of
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and shall promptly deliver or make
available to Parent information concerning the business, properties, assets
and personnel of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request. Parent shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, treat all information provided to or obtained by Parent or
its representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_ as confidential
information for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement (" _Confidential
Information_ ") and, in the event of the termination of this Agreement for any
reason, Parent shall promptly return all Confidential Information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto
shall coordinate such access to ensure that it does not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries.

(b) The Companies shall, subject to (i) contractual and legal restrictions
applicable to it, including attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or similar privilege, (ii) any confidentiality obligation of such party
existing as of the date hereof, (iii) the terms of this Agreement and (iv)
applicable Law, permit Buyer and its Representatives, contractors, architects
and engineers reasonable access to any of the Towers, Tower Sites or DAS Sites
during normal business hours, at Buyers sole cost and expense. In addition,
Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, may perform any inspections, surveys,
measurements, Phase I environmental site assessments and/or environmental
compliance audits which Buyer reasonably deems necessary or appropriate,
provided that the Parent will not take or permit any of its Representatives
to take, any action, including boring, drilling or other soil or groundwater
testing, in its investigation of any Tower Site which impairs or otherwise
interferes with the use and operation of any equipment on or
communications operations being conducted at a Tower Site, without the
Companies prior written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer shall indemnify the Companies, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates for any claims, losses or causes of action caused by,
or incurred in connection with, Buyers inspection of the Tower Sites or other
due diligence activities occurring prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify the Companies, the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates for any claim, loss or cause of action caused by
the negligence or willful misconduct of such Company, Seller or Affiliate.
Before conducting any physical inspection or testing at any Tower Sites,
Buyer shall obtain, and during the period of such inspection or testing shall
maintain, at its expense, wide cover commercial general liability insurance
for bodily injury or property damage in an amount not less than $10 million
for any one occurrence, including a contractual liability endorsement, and
personal injury liability coverage, on an "occurrence basis" with the
Companies and the Sellers as beneficiaries, from an insurer reasonably
acceptable to the Companies. Before making entry upon any Tower Site, Buyer
shall furnish to the Companies certificates of insurance evidencing the
foregoing coverage.

 



72 (c) Each of Parent and Buyer reaffirms and shall fulfill its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that references to
Representatives in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to include
potential sources of Purchasers financing for the Transaction. If for any
reason, termination of the Agreement occurs prior to Closing, the obligations
of Parent and Buyer under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect.

(d) Parent, its Representatives and any other Person acting on behalf and at
the direction of Parent to whom the Sellers shall have consented, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall have the right to contact
any Governmental Entity about any Governmental Authorizations concerning the
Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or the Towers, Tower Sites or DAS Networks
and any party to any of the Ground Leases, Tenant Leases, DAS
Customer Agreements or any other Material Contracts in connection with its
due diligence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that in connection with such communications the Buyers inquiry with
respect to Taxes shall be limited to whether the Taxes have been paid on a
specific Tower Site, Tower or DAS Asset; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Sellers shall have the opportunity to participate in any contacts,
communications or discussions with any Governmental Authority located in the
Territory or with _DoITT_ , it being understood that if Parent and the Sellers
cannot agree in good faith on a reasonable time to make such contact or to
hold such communications or discussions, Parent may proceed without the
Sellers participation. To the extent that any Governmental Authority or third
party provides Parent information that would or would reasonably be likely to
impair the ability of the Companies or the Sellers to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions or would or would reasonably be likely to give rise
to the breach of a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall use commercially reasonably efforts to advise Sellers.

 

(e) To the extent indemnification rights or warranties relating to the Towers,
DAS Networks or Improvements were not assigned to a Company or Company
Subsidiary, Mobilitie LLC shall pursue such indemnification right or warranty
at the Buyers sole expense.

7.7 _Preparation of Financial Statements_.

(a) Prior to the date hereof, the Companies have engaged KPMG to conduct an
audit of the Companies 2011 Financial Statements (as defined below). For
purposes of this _Section 7.7_, the Companies shall, with regard to matters
within their control, use reasonable best efforts, and, with regard to
matters not within their control, use commercially reasonable efforts, to
cause the Companies 2011 Financial Statements to be audited by KPMG (the "
_Companies  Audited 2011 Financial Statements_") and for the Companies
Audited 2011 Financial Statements to be delivered with an unqualified opinion.

 



73 (b) The Companies shall prepare unaudited financial statements of each of
Mobilitie I and Mobilitie II as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011
(the " _Companies  2011 Financial Statements_") and, on or prior to March 19,
2012, shall deliver to Buyer and Parent the Companies 2011
Financial Statements. The Companies 2011 Financial Statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP ((i) subject to year-end accounting and audit
adjustments and (ii) except for the absence of footnotes), applied on a
consistent basis consistent with past practices, and shall fairly present, in
all material respects, the results of operations and financial condition of
the Companies for the respective periods set forth therein.

 

(c) On or prior to March 19, 2012, the Companies shall deliver to KPMG
substantially all of the items on KPMGs PBC request list and cause the
commencement of the audit of the Companies 2011 Financial Statements.

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have confirmed with KPMG
that the Companies have delivered to KPMG the items set forth in _Section
7.7(c)_.

(e) On or prior to April 16, 2012, the Sellers shall have delivered, or caused
to be delivered, to Parent a trial balance of the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

 

(f) On or prior to April 16, 2012, the Sellers shall have delivered, or caused
to be delivered, to Parent a draft of the Companies Audited 2011 Financial
Statements (including all footnote disclosures), which may be further adjusted
as requested by KPMG or as otherwise identified.

(g) On or prior to May 4, 2012, the Sellers shall have delivered, or caused to
be delivered, to Parent the final Companies Audited 2011 Financial
Statements, which shall include KPMGs opinion.

(h) The parties agree that irreparable damage would result and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if the provisions of
_Section 7.7(f)_ and _(g)_ of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, if any party breaches  _Section 7.7(f)_ or _(g)_ ,
Parent shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of an
injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance, without the
proof of actual damages. The Sellers shall waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.
The Sellers agree that they will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) the
other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. If a
court fails to grant such equitable relief, Parent shall be entitled to
seek monetary damages, which damages shall be limited to the out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including fees of accountants and counsel) incurred by
Parent, Buyer or the Companies in connection with the completion of the
Companies Audited 2011 Financial Statements. The remedies set forth in this
_Section 7.7(h)_ are the exclusive remedies for a breach of _Section 7.7(f)_
and _(g)_.

 



74 7.8 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. The parties hereto
acknowledge that Goodwin Procter LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison LLP (together, "Seller Counsel") have each acted as legal counsel to
certain Sellers (including, irrespective of whether the Restructuring has
occurred, Mobilitie Partners I, Mobilitie Partners II and Mobilitie LLC) and
may be deemed to have acted as legal counsel to the Companies prior to the
Closing, and that Seller Counsel intends to act as legal counsel to such
Sellers after the Closing. The parties hereto recognize the community of
interest that exists and will continue to exist until the Closing, and the
parties hereto agree and acknowledge that such community of interest should
continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the Parties agree
that neither Buyer nor the Companies shall seek to have any Seller Counsel
disqualified from representing the Sellers or their respective Affiliates in
any dispute (whether in contract or tort) that may arise between the Companies
or their respective Affiliates formerly represented by Seller Counsel, on the
one hand, and the Sellers or their Affiliates, on the other hand, based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions in whole or in part.

7.9 _Post-Closing Preservation of Records; Access to Information;
Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Parent shall preserve and keep the records of the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries in accordance with Parents document retention policies
relating to the documents created by Parent and its Subsidiaries. Subject to
_Section 7.9(b)_, the Sellers shall be entitled to retain copies of all books
and records related to the tax, accounting, business and financial affairs
related to the operations of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) The Sellers (including, irrespective of whether the Restructuring has
occurred, Mobilitie Partners I, Mobilitie Partners II and Mobilitie LLC) shall
treat and hold as confidential all confidential or proprietary information or
data retained by the Sellers and relating to any Company or Company
Subsidiary (" _Company Proprietary Information_ ") for a period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and continuing for so long as such Company
Proprietary Information constitutes confidential or proprietary information.
If any Seller is requested or required (by oral or written request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process or by applicable Laws)
to disclose any Company Proprietary Information, such Seller shall, if
permitted, notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer,
at its expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with this  _Section 7.9(b)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or
receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose such Company Proprietary Information, such Seller may so
disclose such Company Proprietary Information; _provided_ that such Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such Company Proprietary
Information. Notwithstanding the 

 



75  foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 7.9(b)_ shall not prohibit the
disclosure of Company Proprietary Information by any Seller to the extent
reasonably required (i) to prepare or complete any required Tax Returns or
financial statements, (ii) in connection with audits or other proceedings by
or on behalf of a Governmental Authority, (iii) in connection with any
insurance or benefits claims, or (iv) to comply with applicable Laws or to
enforce this Agreement or Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this _Section 7.9(b)_ shall not apply to information that
(A) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure
by any Seller or its Representatives, (B) is or becomes available to a Seller
on a non-confidential basis from a source that, to such Sellers Knowledge,
did not receive such information from Buyer, another Seller or their
respective Representatives and is not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (C) is or has
been independently developed by a Seller without reference to Company
Proprietary Information.

7.10 _Restructuring_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the parties to the Restructuring
Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
Restructuring prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties to the Restructuring Agreement may amend,
restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Restructuring or the Ancillary
Agreements related thereto, including by amending the allocation of the assets
as among _Section A-1_,  _Section A-2_ and _Section A-3_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that the parties to the Restructuring
Agreement shall not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the
Restructuring or the Ancillary Agreements related thereto in a manner that
would adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates or materially delay or
impair the ability of Sellers and the Companies to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions without the consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

7.11 _Retained Management Assets; Trademarks; Name Change_.

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is not acquiring any
rights in and to the membership interests of Mobilitie LLC, any assets or
other property of Mobilitie LLC or those assets to be assigned to Mobilitie
LLC set forth on _Section 7.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Retained Management Assets_ "), including the Mobilitie Marks and any other
assets owned or used by Mobilitie LLC in providing services to Mobilitie I and
Mobilitie II under the Management Agreements. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall not have any right, title or interest in or to, or right to use, and
Buyer covenants that it will not, and shall cause the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries not to, hereafter adopt, use, or register, or authorize
others to adopt, use or register, any Trademarks (a) consisting of or
incorporating the Mobilitie Marks or (b) that are confusingly similar to any
of the Mobilitie Marks; _provided_ that, in accordance with applicable Law,
Buyer and its Affiliates may, in the ongoing conduct of its business, utilize
stationery, forms, business cards and other similar items that bear the
Mobilitie Marks as of the Closing Date for 30 days following the Closing Date.
To the extent that any Mobilitie Marks have not been removed from the names
of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries by the Closing: (i) the parties
shall cooperate, and both

 



76  parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts, to remove such
Mobilitie Marks from the names of all of the applicable Companies or Company
Subsidiaries as soon as possible following the Closing and (ii) in accordance
with applicable Law, the Mobilitie Marks may continue to be used in names of
the applicable Companies or Company Subsidiaries for up to 30 days following
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Mobilitie LLC shall transfer to the Companies the
data files associated with the OSP Insight software held by Mobilitie LLC
relating to the DAS Assets.

7.12 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Conveyance Taxes; Restructuring Taxes_. Buyer and Seller shall split
equally all sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration,
documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the Contemplated Transactions (other than any such
Taxes that arise solely as a result of the Restructuring ("
_Restructuring Taxes_ "), which shall be borne by the MP Sellers) and the
Sellers and Buyer shall jointly file all required change of ownership and
similar statements. The MP Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to Parent prior to the Closing a report (the " _Restructuring
Taxes Report_ ") prepared by a nationally recognized accounting firm
identifying and quantifying the estimated Taxes, if any, for which a Company
or Company Subsidiary would be liable, if any, arising as a result of the
Restructuring. At the Closing, to secure the obligations of the MP Sellers
with respect to the Restructuring Taxes, the MP Sellers shall deposit an
amount in escrow (the " _Restructuring Taxes Escrow Amount_ ") with an escrow
agent that is mutually acceptable to both Buyer and the Sellers equal to (i)
the Estimated Restructuring Taxes, _less_ (ii) any Restructuring Taxes that
have been paid on or prior to the Closing Date. The Restructuring Taxes
Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy claims for any unpaid Restructuring
Taxes as such Taxes become due and payable. The MP Sellers may authorize the
payment of any Restructuring Taxes from the Restructuring Taxes
Escrow Account or the MP Sellers may pay such amount and be reimbursed from
the Restructuring Taxes Escrow Account. Any amounts remaining from the
Restructuring Taxes Escrow Amount shall be released to the MP Sellers. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Estimated Restructuring Taxes_ " means (A) the
amount of estimated Restructuring Taxes set forth in the Restructuring Taxes
Report or (B) if the Restructuring Taxes Report has not been delivered to
Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date, $12,750,000.

(b) _Section 1031 Exchange_. Parent and Buyer understand that the MP Sellers
may seek to structure the disposition of their Transferred Interests in such
a way that will afford the MP Sellers an opportunity to take advantage of the
provisions of Section 1031 of the Code. Parent shall cooperate with the MP
Sellers (at the MP Sellers sole cost and expense) in such efforts. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, as directed by an MP Seller,
shall make all or such portion as directed of the payments due to such MP
Seller on account of the Purchase Price to a Qualified Intermediary (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) and not to such
MP Seller, as applicable. Each MP Seller reserves the right, in effectuating
such 

 



77  like-kind exchange, to assign such MP Sellers rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary and Buyer hereby
consents to such assignment. Each of Parent and Buyer shall execute such
reasonable documents and otherwise to cooperate in such respects as may
reasonably be requested by the MP Sellers in order to enable the MP Sellers to
carry out a like-kind exchange as aforesaid. A like kind exchange shall not
diminish Parents or Buyers rights, nor increase its liabilities or
obligations, in any manner. MP Sellers will indemnify and hold the Parent,
Buyer, the Companies and each Company Subsidiary, harmless against any
Losses resulting from Parents or Buyers participation described in this
_Section 7.12(b)_. For purposes of this Agreement, a Qualified Intermediary
shall have the same rights as the MP Sellers regarding the receipt of
consideration and the distribution of Stock Consideration hereunder.

(c) _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to or at the Closing, each Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a certificate from such Seller that states that such Seller
is not a foreign person, in form and substance prescribed by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B); _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyers sole
right if Sellers fail to provide such certificate shall be to make an
appropriate withholding under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

 

(d) _Filing of Tax Returns_.

(i) The Sellers shall control and file or cause to be filed all income Tax
Returns of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
which end on or prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall control any Tax
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or any other controversy with
respect to income Taxes of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries that
relate to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, including
the Restructuring. Parent and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the
Sellers to give effect to the provisions of this _Section 7.12(d)_, including
by, providing Sellers access to the books and records of the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries, executing such powers of attorney and signing and
filing Tax Returns necessary to implement the foregoing. Buyer shall not use
the existing employer identification numbers of Mobilitie I, Mobilitie II,
MPGJ I, MPGJ II or MPMA I on any income tax returns for any period commencing
after the Closing.

(ii) Parent shall control and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of
each of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending after the Closing Date. Except to the extent paid pursuant to _Section
2.7_ with respect to Real Estate Taxes or Personal Property Taxes (or taken
into account in adjusting the Final Purchase Price), the Sellers will remit to
the Parent not less than 7 days prior to the due date (or extended due date )
all Taxes due on Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on the Closing Date
or for the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. In the
case of a Tax Return with respect to a taxable period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date (such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(unless required by applicable law), and the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the

 



78  portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be, (A) in
the case of Taxes based on income or receipts determined under the closing of
the books method (or hypothetical closing of the books method if an actual
closing of the books is not available) and (b) in the case of other Taxes,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after
giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such
Taxes with respect to such periods under the relevant Tax law) (or in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period.

7.13 _Affiliate Transactions_. Pursuant to that certain Termination Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the
" _Termination Agreement_ "), at the Closing, any and all Affiliate Contracts
set forth on and marked with an asterisk on _Section 5.16_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated in full effective as of the Closing
Date (such termination to be effected to provide that (a) the Seller or
Affiliate party thereto unconditionally and irrevocably waives any claims that
such Seller or Affiliate has against the applicable Company or Company
Subsidiary and (b) Buyer, the Companies and their Affiliates will not have
any liability following the Closing Date with respect to such Affiliate
Contract).

7.14 _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement; Effectiveness of Registration
Statement_.

(a)

(i) The Parent has an effective automatic shelf registration statement
on Form S-3 registering the transfer or sale of Parent Common Stock and no
stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any
part thereof has been issued. The Registration Statement, any post-effective
amendment thereto, the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement
(the " _Base Prospectus_ ") and any prospectus supplement relating to the
transfer or sale of the Stock Consideration filed with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the " _Prospectus Supplement_ " and
together with the Base Prospectus, the " _Prospectus_ "), each as they may be
amended or supplemented from time to time), together with the exhibits thereto
and the documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Registration Statement_."

 

(ii) The Parent hereby agrees that it will have as of the Closing Date and at
all times prior to the termination of the Restricted Period, other than
during a Suspension Period (as defined below) permitted by _Section 7.15_, an
effective Registration Statement permitting the transfer or sale of the Stock
Consideration. Parent shall notify each Seller of any stop order issued or
threatened to be issued by the SEC in connection with the Registration
Statement and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of
such stop order or to remove it if entered.

 



79 (b) The Parent hereby agrees that

 

(i) the Registration Statement conforms and, at any time that the Registration
Statement is available for use in connection with the transfer or resale of
the Stock Consideration will conform, in all material respects to the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except during any Suspension Period permitted by _Section 7.15(b)_, 

(ii) the Registration Statement does not contain and at any time that the
Registration Statement is available for use in connection with the transfer
or resale of the Stock Consideration will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made not misleading, except during any Suspension Period
permitted by _Section 7.15(b)_; _provided_ , that no representation or
warranty is made as to information contained in or omitted from the
Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information relating to the Sellers furnished to Parent by the Sellers or any
representatives on behalf of the Sellers expressly for use in the Registration
Statement; and

(iii) the Prospectus, at any time that such Prospectus is available for use in
connection with the transfer or resale of the Stock Consideration, will
conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except during any Suspension Period
permitted by _Section 7.15_; _provided_ , that no representation or warranty
is made as to information contained in or omitted from such Prospectus in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to the
Sellers furnished to Parent by the Sellers or any representatives on behalf of
the Sellers expressly for use in such Prospectus.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any outstanding
obligations to register for resale shares of Parent Common Stock. Except with
the written consent of the Oaktree Sellers and the Jabara Sellers, prior to
the earlier of (1) the termination of the Restricted Period or (2) the sale of
all of the Stock Consideration, Parent will not grant any Person any
registration rights relating to the Parent Common Stock that are more
favorable than, or inconsistent with, any of the registration rights contained
herein.

7.15 _Prospectus Supplement; Marketed Secondary Offering_.

(a) Parent agrees to provide each Seller with a copy of the Seller
Questionnaire on the date hereof, to the extent not provided prior to the date
hereof. Parent covenants and agrees to prepare and file with the SEC the
Prospectus Supplement registering the transfer and/or resale of the Stock
Consideration within one (1) Business Day after receipt of fully completed
Seller Questionnaires from either the MP Sellers or the Oaktree Sellers;
_provided_ that if such Seller Questionnaires are delivered prior to the
Closing Date, then the Prospectus Supplement shall be filed immediately after
the Closing. During the Restricted Period, Parent will thereafter file an

 



80  additional prospectus supplement once every fifteen (15) calendar days for
two (2) consecutive months registering the transfer and/or resale of that
portion of the Stock Consideration covered by additional Seller
Questionnaires; _provided_ , that with respect to the Prospectus Supplement
due after the first and third 15-day periods only, the shares of Stock
Consideration to be registered or transferred among the Sellers represent at
least ten percent (10%) of the Stock Consideration. From the end of the two
(2) month period and thereafter, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of
additional Seller Questionnaires, Parent shall file a prospectus supplement
registering the transfer and/or resale of that portion of the Stock
Consideration covered by such Seller Questionnaires, provided, however, that
Parent shall not be required to file more than one prospectus supplement per
month. Parent further agrees to file promptly with the SEC any amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus that may, in the judgment of Parent and the
Sellers, be required by the Securities Act or requested by the SEC. During the
Restricted Period, Parent agrees to advise each Seller, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed and to promptly deliver such number of Prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto as Sellers may reasonably request.

(b) Parent covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier of (i) the
termination of the Restricted Period or (ii) the date that all the Stock
Consideration shall have been disposed of or sold by Sellers (the "
_Registration Period_ "). Parent may suspend the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and the use of any Prospectus included therein in the
event, and for such period of time as (i) such a suspension is required by the
rules and regulations of the SEC as applied to Parent, (ii) such Prospectus
Supplement ceases to meet the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act
or (iii) in the good faith determination by Parents board of directors,
offers and sales pursuant to the Registration Statement should not be made by
reason of the existence of material undisclosed circumstances or developments
with respect to which the disclosure that would be required in the
Registration Statement would be premature and would have an adverse effect on
Parent (each a " _Suspension Event_ " and the period during which the
Suspension Event continues to be true, a " _Suspension Period_ "). Parent will
immediately advise each Seller of any Suspension Event, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Suspension Period to terminate
at the earliest possible date; _provided_ , that Parent may not initially
suspend the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a period of more
than 45 days (the " _Initial Suspension Period_ "); _provided_ , that Parent
may extend the Initial Suspension Period for up to (i) an additional forty-
five (45) days if the Initial Suspension Period began within sixty (60) days
of the Closing Date, (ii) an additional seventy-five (75) days if the Initial
Suspension Period began more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, in
each case of clauses (i) and (ii), solely to the extent that Parent requires
such extension of time to complete financial statements required under
applicable Law to be contained in Parents SEC filings; _provided, further_ ,
that Parent may not commence a new Suspension Period within 15 Business Days
of the expiration of the preceding Suspension Period. Following receipt of any
such notice, and until such Suspension Period is terminated, the Sellers will
not make use of the Prospectus and will not make any sales requiring
delivery of such Prospectus. Parent also agrees to notify each Seller
immediately of the happening of any event as a result of

 



81  which the Registration Statement, as then in effect, or any Prospectus would
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein (in the case of a
Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made), not
misleading, and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly update
and/or correct such Registration Statement and Prospectus.

(c) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, if at the time of any
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, including by way of a
Section 10(a)(3) amendment, Parent is not a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) or is an "ineligible issuer" (as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), or is otherwise not permitted
to utilize an automatic shelf registration statement under the Securities Act,
Parent shall promptly, and in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
after being unable to use an automatic shelf registration statement, file a
registration statement on Form S-3, or any other appropriate form, registering
the transfer and or resale of the Stock Consideration and the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this  _Section 7.15_ regarding the
Registration Statement and any Prospectus shall apply to such new registration
statement and prospectus. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause that registration statement to become effective as promptly as
possible.

(d) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall take all
actions set forth in this _Section 7.15(d)_ to permit the Sellers to sell
all or a portion of the Stock Consideration in one Marketed Secondary
Offering.

(i) If any Seller proposes to resell any of the Stock Consideration through a
Marketed Secondary Offering, such Seller shall provide Parent and each other
Seller notice of such intent no later than twenty (20) calendar days prior to
such proposed offering (" _Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering_ ").
Upon notice from Sellers representing in excess of 50% of the Stock
Consideration issued at the Closing of its or their intent to sell all or any
portion of the Stock Consideration through a Marketed Secondary Offering,
Parent shall, within seven (7) calendar days of receiving such Notice of
Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering, either (i) notify the Sellers either
included in the Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering or that
otherwise notified Parent of its or their desire to have shares of Stock
Consideration included in the Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering that it
intends to exercise its rights to delay the Marketed Secondary Offering
because it intends to conduct a primary offering of Parent Common Stock within
thirty (30) calendar days of the Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary
Offering, (ii) notify the Sellers that a Suspension Event has occurred and is
continuing, or (ii) notify the Sellers of its intent to file a prospectus
supplement for the Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering.

 

(ii) If Parent intends to exercise its right to delay the Proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering in order to conduct a primary offering, the Parent shall
send each Seller notice of its intent to conduct a primary offering and, if
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt of Parents notice, any
Seller shall so request in writing, Parent shall include in such offering all
or any part of the Stock Consideration

 



82  owned by the Sellers requested to be included, except that if, in connection
with any underwritten public offering for the account of Parent the managing
underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a limitation on the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock which may be included because, in such underwriter(s)
judgment, marketing or other factors dictate such limitation is necessary to
facilitate public distribution, then any such limitation shall be implemented
on a pro rata basis with respect to all the Parent Common Stock that the
Parent and the Sellers had initially intended to be included in such primary
offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless Stock
Consideration representing more than 75% of the issued Stock Consideration is
included in such primary offering, such offering shall not be counted as a
Marketed Secondary Offering for the purposes of this Agreement

 

(iii) If a Suspension Event has occurred and is continuing at the time the
Parent receives the Notice of Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering, then the
obligations of the Parent set forth in this _Section 7.15(d)_ shall be
suspended until the termination of such Suspension Period at which time the
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions set
forth in this _Section 7.15(d)_ to permit the Sellers to sell their Stock
Consideration in a Marketed Secondary Offering.

(iv) If the Parent has not exercised its right to delay a Proposed Marketed
Secondary Offering and if a Suspension Period has not occurred or has been
completed, then Parent, upon receipt of the name of the proposed
underwriters, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be sold and all
other information regarding the proposed offering required to be included in
the prospectus supplement, prepare and file a "red herring"
prospectus supplement related to such Proposed Marketed Secondary Offering.
Promptly upon pricing of such Marketed Secondary Offering, Parent shall
prepare and file a "final" prospectus supplement related to such Marketed
Secondary Offering. 

(e) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, in connection with a
Marketed Secondary Offering, Parent shall enter into such customary
agreements and take all such other actions (including underwriting agreements
and causing the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer to
participate in a "road show" of reasonable length based on the recent
offerings of the Parent) as the underwriters reasonably request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Stock Consideration; provided,
however, in no case will any lock-up provisions required from Parent and/or
its affiliates be more restrictive than that agreed to by Parent in its most
recent underwriting or purchase agreement. In any such Marketed Secondary
Offering of any Stock Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to select one
manager from the list of the Parent Approved Underwriters and the Sellers
participating in the offering shall have the right to select one manager from
the list of the Sellers Approved Underwriters or Parent Approved Underwriters
to act as joint and equal bookrunners. The Marketed Secondary Offering shall
be subject to the agreement of all lead managers that the time and size of the
Marketed Secondary Offering is appropriate.

(f) If any Sellers intend to sell any portion of the Stock Consideration
through the Marketed Secondary Offering or to include any Stock

 



83  Consideration in Parents primary offering, the Sellers shall agree to (i)
sell such Stock Consideration on the terms provided in a customary
underwriting agreement, including any lock-ups reasonably requested by the
underwriters and (ii) complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required
under the terms of such underwriting agreement or reasonably requested by
Parent.

(g) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall be
responsible for paying (i) 50% of all of the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with one Marketed Secondary Offering (together with any primary
offerings that did not constitute a Marketed Secondary Offering pursuant to
_Section 7.15(d)(ii)_) and 100% of the costs associated with one (1)
Approved Block Trade or (ii) 100% of all the costs and expenses incurred with
two Approved Block Trades (limited to registration fees, attorney fees of
Parent, fees of Parents independent public accountants, and printing
expenses associated with the preparation and distribution of the requested
prospectuses and prospectus supplements) (whether or not such offering or
trades are completed). The participating Sellers shall pay all other costs
and expenses associated with a Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block
Trade, including all of their costs and expenses associated with such sales
(including attorney fees of such Sellers and applicable stock transfer taxes
and underwriting discounts and commissions). In connection with a Marketed
Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade, to the extent required by the
relevant underwriters, Parent shall obtain so-called "comfort letters" from
Parents independent public accountants, and legal opinions of counsel to
Parent addressed to the underwriters and the SEC, in customary form and
covering such matters as are customarily covered by such letters and opinions;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall only be responsible for paying 100%
of the costs and expenses associated with up to two (2) comfort letters and
legal opinions (as set forth above) and all other costs associated with such
comfort letters will be paid by the Sellers. Delivery of any such opinions or
comfort letters shall be subject to the recipient furnishing such written
representations or acknowledgements as are customarily provided by
underwriters who receive such comfort letters or opinions. 

(h) Parent shall file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it
under the Exchange Act. If Parent is not required to file reports pursuant to
the Exchange Act, upon the request of any Seller, Parent shall make publicly
available the information specified in subparagraph (c)(2) of Rule 144. Parent
shall take such further action as may be reasonably required from time to
time and as may be within the reasonable control of Parent, to enable the
Sellers to transfer the Stock Consideration without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the
request of any Seller, Parent will deliver to such Seller a written statement
as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the
specifics thereof. In connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition
by a holder of any shares of Stock Consideration pursuant to Rule 144, Parent
shall cooperate with such holder to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of certificates representing shares of Stock Consideration to be
sold and not bearing any Securities Act legend, and enable certificates for
such shares of Stock Consideration to be for such number of shares and
registered in such names as the holder may reasonably request. 

 



84 (i) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall not,
directly or indirectly, (x) enter into any merger, consolidation or
reorganization in which Parent shall not be the surviving corporation or (y)
transfer or agree to transfer all or substantially all of Parents assets,
unless (i) Parent shall have waived in writing the resale restrictions set
forth in _Section 2.10_ or (ii) prior to such merger, consolidation,
reorganization or asset transfer, the surviving corporation or the transferee,
respectively, shall have agreed in writing to assume the obligations of
Parent under this Agreement.

(j) Prior to the termination of the Registration Period, Parent shall take
such other actions as are reasonably required and customary in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Stock Consideration pursuant to
a Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade. In connection with a
Marketed Secondary Offering or Approved Block Trade, Parent shall make
available for inspection by (i) one authorized representative of each
participating Seller, (ii) any underwriter participating in a Marketed
Secondary Offering, and (iii) each of their representatives, all financial
and other information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide
such persons the opportunity to discuss the business affairs of Parent with
its principal executives and independent public accountants who have
certified the audited financial statements included in the Registration
Statement in each case as necessary to enable them to exercise their due
diligence responsibility under the Securities Act; _provided, however_ , that
the information that Parent determines, in good faith, to be confidential and
which Parent advises such person in writing is confidential shall not be
disclosed unless such person signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

(k) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller Indemnitee
from and against any and all Losses as incurred, arising out of or based upon
any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which the transfer or sale of
Stock Consideration was registered under the Securities Act, the Prospectus
and any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus
contained in the Registration Statement, including any "free writing
prospectus" filed by the Parent, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading except to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statements, alleged untrue
statements, omissions or alleged omissions are based solely upon written
information relating to the Sellers furnished to Parent by the Sellers or any
representatives on behalf of the expressly for use in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, or any violation or alleged violation
by the Parent of the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any state securities law,
or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent
and relating to action or inaction required of the Parent in connection with
any such Registration. If any Seller Indemnitee becomes involved in any
capacity in any Litigation in connection with any matter arising out of or in
connection with the matters contemplated in this _Section 7.15_, Parent
shall reimburse such Seller Indemnitee for its reasonable legal and other
reasonable out-of-pocket

 



85  expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) as they
are incurred in connection therewith; _provided_ that such Seller Indemnitee
shall promptly repay to Parent the amount of any such reimbursed expenses
paid to it if it shall be finally judicially determined that such Seller
Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification by, or contribution from,
Parent in connection with such Litigation. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
a Seller Indemnitee and shall survive the transfer of the Stock Consideration
by the Sellers. The indemnity contained in this _Section 7.15(k)_ is
the sole remedy for a breach of this _Section 7.15(k)_ and is in lieu of any
liability that the Parent may have to pursuant to _Article X_ hereof.

(l) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Indemnitees (as
defined below) are intended third-party beneficiaries of _Section 7.15(k) _of
this Agreement.

 

7.16 _Non-Competition_.

(a) Each of the Sellers hereby acknowledge that: (i) each of the Sellers has
certain knowledge of the business operations that may be required to ensure
the effective and successful conduct of the business of Buyer, and has access
to trade secrets and confidential business methods, plans and practices
considered confidential by Buyer, this information has commercial value in the
business in which Buyer will be engaged after the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer will be irreparably damaged
and its substantial investment in the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement materially impaired if any Seller were to enter into an activity
competing with the business of Buyer in violation of the terms of this
_Section 7.16_ or if any Seller were to disclose or make unauthorized use of
any confidential information concerning the business of the Buyer or Parent;
(ii) the scope and length of the term of this _Section 7.16_ and the
geographical restrictions contained herein are fair and reasonable and not the
result of overreaching, duress or coercion of any kind and the full,
uninhibited and faithful observance of each of the agreements and covenants
contained in this _Section 7.16_ will not cause any Seller any undue
hardship, financial or otherwise, and enforcement of each of the covenants
contained in this _Section 7.16 _will not impair any Sellers ability, if
any of them so desires, to obtain work commensurate with each of their
abilities and on terms fully acceptable to them or otherwise obtain income
required for the comfortable support of their respective families and
the satisfaction of the needs of their respective creditors; and (iii) the
agreements and covenants provided by the Sellers in this _Section 7.16_ are
reasonable and necessary to Buyers and Parents protection of
their legitimate interests in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that
the provisions of this _Section 7.16_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction
in which enforcement is sought. If any particular provisions or portion of
this _Section 7.16_ shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, it
is the intention of the parties that the provision shall be amended to
conform with the maximum limitations permitted by applicable law (but not in
excess of the terms hereof), and together with all other provisions of this
Section 7.16, shall remain valid and enforceable and continue in full force
and effect to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law (but not in
excess of the terms hereof).

 



86 (b) Except as may otherwise be permitted by this _Section 7.16_, each of
the (x) Oaktree Sellers and (y) MP Sellers and the Affiliates of the MP
Sellers, hereby covenants and agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly,
in any capacity of any Person, without the express prior written approval of
Parent (which approval may be withheld for any reason in its sole and
absolute discretion):

(i) develop, construct, own, manage or operate any communications tower or
any Outdoor DAS Node within a radius of one and a half (1.5) miles from any
Tower (as listed on _Section B_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) purchased
pursuant to this Agreement and located within the United States of America at
any time during the period of time beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date;

(ii) develop, construct, own, manage or operate any communications tower or
any DAS within the Territory at any time during the period of time beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is two (2) years after the
Closing Date;

(iii) develop, construct, own, manage or operate any communications tower or
any Outdoor DAS node within a radius of one (1) mile from any Outdoor DAS
Node Site (as listed in _Section 5.20(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
purchased pursuant to this Agreement at any time during the period of time
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is five (5) years
after the Closing Date;

(iv) develop, construct, own, manage or operate any Indoor/Venue DAS in any
of the locations listed on _Section 7.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or anywhere in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada at any time during the
period of time beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is
five (5) years after the Closing Date;

(v) contact any Ground Lessor under any Ground Lease (as listed on _Section
5.10(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for the purpose of acquiring
any interest in the property subject to the applicable Ground Lease or
acquiring an interest in the Ground Lessors property immediately adjacent to
the premises subject to the Ground Lease for the greater of five (5) years or
the term of the Ground Lease, including any extensions thereto; and

 

(vi) lease, sublease, license, sublicense or otherwise receive a right to use
any capacity in the DAS Fiber Assets purchased pursuant to this Agreement
from a party other than the Parent or its assignee.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in
this _Section 7.16_ shall inhibit, restrict or otherwise prevent Sellers
from,

 



87 (i) constructing, owning, managing, or operating any Wi-Fi network
or providing any Wi-Fi services anywhere in the world at any time;

(ii) acquiring, owning, managing for their own account and operating a
portfolio of towers anywhere in the world and at any time that is or has been
developed and constructed without any involvement on the part the Oaktree
Sellers, the MP Sellers or any of their Affiliates and is acquired from an
unaffiliated third party in a bona fide (i.e., authentic and genuine in
nature), arms length transaction;

(iii) operating or managing, as a for hire third party manager, a portfolio of
towers that is or has been developed and constructed without any involvement
on the part the Oaktree Sellers, the MP Sellers or any of their Affiliates
and is owned by a major wireless carrier anywhere in the world and at any time
pursuant to a bona fide (i.e., authentic and genuine in nature), arms length
agreement with any such major wireless carrier; or 

(iv) owning, either of record or beneficially, five percent (5%) or less of
(a) the outstanding securities of any class of securities of a public company
that is engaged in the same business as Parent or (b) a passive investment
(e.g., limited partner with no management role) in a private equity or hedge
fund that invests or has invested in an entity that is in the same business
as Parent.

Any transaction, whether under this _Section 7.16(c)_ or otherwise, that
is merely a contrivance to avoid the effect of the obligations under _Section
7.16(b)_ shall be deemed a violation of _Section 7.16(b)_. By way of example,
but not limitation, if any Seller were to provide non-recourse financing
to the developer of a communications tower within a radius of one and a half
(1.5) miles from any Tower (as listed on _Section B_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) purchased pursuant to this Agreement and located within
the United States of America at any time during the period of time beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is five (5) years after the
Closing Date and then acquire such communications tower by a foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure of such non-recourse financing, such transaction
would be a violation of _Section 7.16(b)_.

(d) The parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under this
_Section 7.16_ by Sellers is special, unique and extraordinary in character
and each of the Sellers acknowledge that Buyer and Parent will be irreparably
damaged (and damages at law would be an inadequate remedy) if this _Section
7.16_ is not specifically enforced. Therefore, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach by any Seller of any restrictive provision of this _Section
7.16_, Buyer and Parent shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights or
remedies which may be available at law or in equity, to an injunction re-
straining such breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to
post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the
provisions of this _Section 7.16_. The terms of this _Section 7.16_ shall
survive the Closing for the periods specified herein.

 



88 (e) The Sellers agree that Buyer may resell all or substantially all of the
DAS Networks to the DAS Purchaser and such DAS Purchaser will be a
beneficiary of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.16_ and that
such DAS Purchaser may directly enforce, or Parent or the Buyer may enforce on
behalf of such DAS Purchaser, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.16_.

7.17 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, no Seller will,
directly or indirectly, or as an officer, agent, employee, partner or
director of any other Person, solicit or hire any Person who is or was during
the twelve months prior thereto, an employee, independent contractor, officer,
director or consultant of Parent, Buyer or their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall be in default of
the foregoing sentence as a result of any employment that arises out of
responses to advertising in periodicals (web-based or otherwise) of general
circulation, internet or online classifieds, or other general solicitations
that are not specifically targeted at employees, independent contractors,
officers, directors or consultants of Parent, Buyer or their Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, none of
Parent or Buyer will, directly or indirectly, or as an officer, agent,
employee, partner or director of any other Person, solicit or hire any Person
who is or was during the twelve months prior thereto, an employee, independent
contractor, officer, director or consultant of Sellers, the Companies
or their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent or Buyer shall be in default of the foregoing sentence as a result of
any employment that arises out of responses to advertising in periodicals
(web-based or otherwise) of general circulation, internet or online
classifieds, or other general solicitations that are not specifically targeted
at employees, independent contractors, officers, directors or consultants of
Sellers, the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries.

7.18 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, each of the Parent and the Sellers shall give notice to the
other party of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event, fact or
circumstance of which Parent, Buyer, the Sellers, the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has knowledge, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which such party believes would cause a failure of the
conditions set forth in either _Sections 8.1(a)_ or _(b)_ or _9.1(a)_ , as
applicable, to be satisfied and (ii) any failure of Parent, Buyer, the
Sellers, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
materially to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder on or prior to the Closing;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.18_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent, Buyer, the Sellers, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, as the
case may be.

7.19 _Completion of Incomplete Towers_. The Sellers shall cause Mobilitie LLC
to complete the construction of the Incomplete Towers, at Sellers sole
expense, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Construction
Management Agreement.

 



89 7.20 _Construction Liabilities_. After the Closing, Sellers, and not Buyer,
the Companies or any Company Subsidiary, shall be obligated to pay any
Construction Liabilities of any Company or Company Subsidiaries (i) arising
prior to the Closing and (ii) arising in connection with the completion of any
Incomplete Tower to the extent not paid on or prior to the Closing. Sellers
shall promptly pay all Construction Liabilities when due. If any Construction
Liabilities assumed by the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 7.20_ are
reimbursed to Buyer following the Closing, then Buyer shall remit such
reimbursed amounts to the Sellers.

7.21 _Organizational Documents_. On or prior to the Closing, each Company
shall deliver to Parent a copy of (A) the certificates of formation of such
Company and each of its Company Subsidiaries (only with respect to the
entities that are organized in the United States), certified by the states of
their respective organizations, as of a date as near as practicable to the

(a)

 

(i) Prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period and solely from the

94  and severally indemnify Buyer, Parent, their respective Affiliates and the

such Person (collectively, " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") and hold Buyer

(1) arising out of or resulting from a breach of any Seller Representation or
Company Representation contained in this Agreement, other than a breach of the
representations set forth in  _Sections 4.2_, _4.3_ , _4.7_ , _5.2_ ,

(3) arising out of or resulting from a breach of the representations or

_4.3_ , _4.7_ , _5.2_ , _5.4(a)_ and _(b_ ), _5.5(b)_ , _5.7(d)_ , _5.12_ and

on, or exercise a power of sale with respect to, a Fee Mortgage Site, if such

disturb the possession by a Company or a Company Subsidiary of such
Fee Mortgage Site; (y) any action to disturb the possession by a Company or
Company Subsidiary of a Tower Site or a DAS Site taken by the holder of a
superior Lien on the fee interest in such Tower Site or DAS Site (including a
judgment lienor or mechanics lienor but not including any taxing authority),
which Lien was recorded with the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to

 regardless of when such Lien attached), or by a subsequent owner of or other
holder of a superior interest in such Tower Site or DAS Site, if such superior
Lien or evidence of such ownership or other superior interest was recorded
with the appropriate Governmental Authority prior to the recordation, if any,
of the applicable Ground Lessee or DAS Access Agreement or a memorandum
thereof (or if such Ground Lease or DAS Agreement or a memorandum thereof was
not recorded at all with such Governmental Authority), but only, in the case
of this clause (z), if such holder or owner has the right so to disturb such
possession because of the failure to record such Ground Lease, DAS Access
Agreement or memorandum prior to the recordation of such superior Lien or such
evidence). If a Ground Lease or DAS Access Agreement, or a memorandum thereof,
has been submitted for recording to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
then for purposes of this clause (vi) such Ground Lease, DAS Access Agreement
or memorandum shall be deemed to have been recorded;

 

(8) arising from the 1% interest held by the third party in Mobilitie

(9) on account of amounts for which Mobilitie LLC is liable under the

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
for purposes of determining "Losses" subject to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 10.2(a)_, Losses resulting from any indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)(3)(y)_ shall be equal to the product of (A) the excess
of the Total Tower Cash Flow set forth on _Section 5.22_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule _over_ the actual Tower Cash Flow _multiplied by_ (B)
[****] (the " _Valuation Multiplier_ ") (it being understood that such Losses
shall initially be calculated without the application of any multiple,
consideration of diminution in value, or similar concepts). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss pursuant to _Sections
10.2(a)(i)(1)_, _(2)_ or _(3)(x)_ to the extent that the breach or matter
giving rise to such Loss would also reduce any component of Total Tower Cash
Flow and would be factored in the calculation of total Tower Cash Flow for
purposes of _Section 5.22_. By way of illustration, and not limitation, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any breach of
a representation relating to the amount of rent payable under a Tenant Lease
set forth in _Section 5.10(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule if
there is also a breach of the Total Tower Cash Flow representations set forth
in _Section 5.22_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

5.2_, _5.4(a)_ and _(b_ ), _5.5(b)_ and _5.12_ , (2) arising out of _Section
10.2(a)(i)(4)_ which shall survive in the same manner as the representations
in _Section 5.12_, or (3) arising out of or related to the Excluded Assets,
Excluded Liabilities, the Retained Management Assets or the Existing

clause (i) for its aggregate pro rata share of any such Losses based on the
percentages set forth on _Section C_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;

(ii) Each of the Oaktree Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and
hold Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any and all Losses actually suffered or

hold Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any and all Losses actually suffered or
incurred by Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from a breach of any

4.2_, _4.3_ and _4.7_ ; (B) the Jabara Sellers shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from a
breach of any representation or warranty of any Jabara Seller contained in
_Sections 4.2_, _4.3_ and _4.7_ and (C) the Askelson Seller shall indemnify
and hold Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any and all Losses actually suffered
or incurred by Buyer Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from a breach of
any representation or warranty of any Askelson Seller contained in _Sections
4.2_, _4.3_ and _4.7_ ; it being understood that none of the Sellers set
forth in clauses (A), (B) or (C) shall be liable for any breach by any Seller
set forth in another clause;

_provided, however_ , that (i) the aggregate maximum liability of the MP
Sellers, in the aggregate, pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed
the portion of the Purchase Price received by the MP Sellers in the aggregate
and (ii) the aggregate maximum liability of the Oaktree Sellers, in the
aggregate, pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed the portion of
the Purchase Price received by the Oaktree Sellers in the aggregate.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their respective
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
partners and members (each, a " _Seller Indemnitee_ ," and together with the
Buyer Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ " and each an " _Indemnitee_ "), from
and against any and all Losses arising

 



97  out of or resulting from (i) any breach of the Buyer Representations or (ii)
any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent or
Buyer in this Agreement. 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Buyer and Parent may transfer all
or substantially all of the DAS Assets to a single third party (the " _DAS
Purchaser_ ") and (x) this Article X shall survive any such transfer to a DAS
Purchaser, including any indemnification obligations of the Sellers with
respect to the DAS Assets, and (y) (A) whether a breach or alleged breach of
any representation or warranty or covenant relating to the DAS Assets has
occurred will be determined and (B) any indemnification or other remedies
subsequently sought by the Buyer Indemnitees will be calculated under this
Agreement in each case (i) as if the Buyer had continued to own and operate
the DAS Assets and (ii) without regard to any Losses that the Buyer may owe to
the DAS Purchaser.

 

10.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a)

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Buyer
Indemnitees under (x) _Sections 10.2(a)(i)(1)_, _(2)_ , _(7)_ and _(9)_
until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under 
_Sections 10.2(a)(i)(1)_, _(2)_ , _(7)_ and _(9)_ exceeds (i) 2.0% of the
Base Purchase Price, and (y) _Section 10.2(a)(i)(3)(y)_ until the aggregate
amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under _Section
10.2(a)(i)(3)(y)_ exceeds 1.5% of the Base Purchase Price (each of clauses (x)
and (y), as applicable, a " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Buyer Indemnitee
shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in excess of the
applicable Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Buyer
Indemnitees under _Section 10.2(a)(i)(3)_ or _(4_ ) for (x) Losses arising
from Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes of the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries that were not assessed as of the Closing Date but for which the
relevant Governmental Authority is seeking retroactive payment until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable exceeds $250,000,
or (y) with respect to Real Estate Taxes or Personal Property Taxes to the
extent such Taxes were paid pursuant to _Section 2.7_ (or taken into
account in adjusting the Final Purchase Price).

(ii) Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the full amount of all
Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees in connection with, relating to, or
arising from any obligations arising out of or related to any Excluded Assets
or Excluded Liabilities or the Retained Management Assets; provided, however,
that Losses arising during the Escrow Period shall initially be recoverable
from the Indemnification Escrow Account and Losses arising subsequent to the
Escrow Period shall be recoverable from the MP Sellers and the Oaktree Sellers
in accordance with the provisions of  _Sections 10.2(b)(i)_ and _(ii)_
above.

 



98 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except with
respect to any Losses arising out of or related to any Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities or the Retained Management Assets, which Losses shall be
subject to the limitations described in the preceding sentence, the cumulative
indemnification obligations of the Sellers under this _Article_ _X_ shall
in no event in the aggregate exceed the amount of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (as it shall be reduced from time to time to reflect payments, if any,
made from time to time from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this _Article_ _X_ and the Escrow
Agreement).

(b) Other than the Valuation Multiplier, which is solely applicable to
indemnification under _Section_ _10.2(a)(i)(3) (y)_ , under no circumstances
shall any Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified for special,
consequential, indirect, punitive or other similar damages, including lost
profits, lost revenues, diminution in value, business interruptions, or loss
of business opportunity or reputation.

 

(c) Other than the Valuation Multiplier, which is solely applicable to
indemnification under _Section_ _10.2(a)(i)(3) (y)_ , no multiplier or
similar concept shall be applied for purposes of calculating Losses. To the
extent that Buyer or Parent is seeking indemnification under this _Article_
_X,_ each of them shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis of an indemnification claim
hereunder (including by using such efforts to seek reimbursement by the
applicable Tenant pursuant to the applicable Tenant Lease or to pursue
a claim under any insurance policy issued in favor of a Company or a Company
Subsidiary that was in effect prior to the Closing Date or by pursuing any
other third party indemnification obligations that may be available). For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Buyer nor the Parent will be obligated to
pursue any claim under insurance policies owned by the Buyer or Parent.

 

(d) For purposes of this _Article_ _X_ , with respect to each representation
or warranty set forth in this Agreement, other than those representations and
warranties set forth (i) in the last sentence of _Section_ _5.1_ , (ii)
_Section_ _5.7(b)_ , (iii) _Section_ _5.8_ , (iv) _Section_ _5.10(n)_
(and the related definition of " _Material Contract_ "), (v) the second
sentence of _Section_ _7.7(b)_ , (vi) _Section_ _6.12(a)_ and _(b)_ ,
and (vii) the last sentence of _Section_ _6.12(d)_ , (A) the determination
of whether a breach of such representation or warranty has occurred and (B)
the calculation of Losses upon the determination that a breach has occurred,
shall be determined without regard to any limitation or qualification as to
materiality, "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" in such representation or warranty.

 

(e) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing
or (ii) for any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly delivered prior
to the applicable Cut-Off Date.

 



99 10.4 _Indemnification Claim Process_.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification by either a Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee under this _Article_ _X_ shall be asserted and resolved in
accordance with this _Section_ _10.4_ and _Section_ _10.5_.

(b) If a Buyer Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Article_ _X_ , the Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly, but in no event more
than 30 calendar days following such Buyer Indemnitees knowledge of such
claim, notify Sellers in writing of such claim, describing such claim in
reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (the "
_Claims Notice_ "); _provided, however_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Sellers from any of their obligations under this
_Article_ _X_ except to the extent the Sellers are materially prejudiced by
such failure.

(c) If a Seller Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Article_ _X_ , the Seller Indemnitee shall promptly, but in no event more
than 30 calendar days following such Seller Indemnitees knowledge of such
claim, deliver a Claims Notice to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release Buyer from any of their
obligations under this  _Article_ _X_ except to the extent Buyer is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

(d) Sellers (in the case of the Buyer Indemnitees) or Buyer (in the case of
the Seller Indemnitees) (as applicable, the " _Indemnitor_ ") shall have the
right, at its option, to assume the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice at
the expense of such Indemnitor; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Action, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against any Indemnified Party, or (iii) the interests of the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee with respect to such claim are in conflict with one
another and, as a result, the Indemnitor could not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnitee in such claim. If the Indemnitor assumes the
defense of such claim: (A) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at
its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim, but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof; (B) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor; and (C)
the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee unless the judgment or settlement provides
solely for the payment of money, the Indemnitor makes such payment (subject to
the applicable limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an
unconditional release. The parties shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any settlement entered
into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;
provided that the Indemnitors consent to settlement shall not waive
any dispute as to whether the Losses are indemnifiable pursuant to this
_Article_ _X_.

 



100  (e) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor (i) shall have the right to participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense; and (ii) shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered
into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
provided that the Indemnitors consent to settlement shall not waive any
dispute as to whether the Losses are indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article_
_X_.

10.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
shall deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of
any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder,
which Claims Notice shall include all relevant information with respect to
such Third Party Claim then in the possession of the Indemnitee; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this _Article_ _X_ except to
the extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining
the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Escrow Account_. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in the case of
fraud (other than negligent misrepresentation), other than set forth in the
last sentence of _Sections_ _7.5(d)_ (in which case Buyer and Parent shall
be entitled to seek specific performance with respect to the Sellers
obligations to assign the utility pole reservations),  _7.7(h)_ (in which
case the remedies for breach of the provisions of _Section_ _7.7(f)_ and
_(g)_ shall be as specified therein) or _7.16(d)_ (in which case the remedies
for breach of the provisions of  _Section_ _7.16_ shall be as specified in
_Section 7.16(d)_), the provisions of this _Article_ _X_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of parties following the Closing for any and all breaches
or alleged breaches of any Seller Representations, Company Representations,
Buyer Representations or covenants or agreements of the parties, or any other
provision of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
parties agree that no party hereto shall have any other remedies or cause of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) for any covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or for any statements,
communications, disclosures, failures to disclosure, representations or
warranties (whether written or oral), whether or not set forth in this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall
any party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or
seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in
nature and subject to this _Section_ _10.6_. The 

 



101   parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) there is not, and there has
not been, any form of confidential, special or fiduciary relationship between
the Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers and the Companies, on
the other hand, and (ii) accordingly, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto shall have any remedy or cause of
action for equitable fraud.

 

(b) If any Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible are recoverable from
a third party, upon indemnification of the Indemnitee by the Indemnitor for
such Losses, the Indemnitee shall assign any rights that it may have to
recover such amounts to the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall be fully
subrogated to the Indemnitees rights against such third party.

 

(c) At any time and from time to time following the Closing, Sellers may
elect, by written notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent, to sell or otherwise
dispose of all or a portion of the Escrow Shares in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, subject to the limitations on resale of the Stock Consideration set
forth in _Section_ _2.10_ , with the net proceeds from any such sale
remaining in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. If at any time the
Indemnification Escrow Account is comprised of both cash and Escrow Shares,
then the Sellers may elect to deliver either Escrow Shares (valued at the SBA
Average Closing Price), cash or any combination of Escrow Shares and cash, in
order to satisfy any Losses pursuant to this _Article_ _X_.

10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price (paid by
the applicable Seller) for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes,
and the parties shall file their Tax Returns accordingly.

10.8 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnitor
to any Indemnitee (including pursuant to this _Article_ _X_ ) in connection
with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective Affiliates, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated to and shall stand
in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect
of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to
such claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or
demand. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnitor in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnitor, in presenting any subrogated
right, defense or claim.

ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may not be terminated prior to the
Closing, except as follows:

(a) by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers;

 



102  (b) at the election of Buyer or any Seller upon prior written notice, if any
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Article_ _VIII_ or _Article_
_IX_ respectively (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing) has not been fulfilled as of the close of business June
17, 2012 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ _11.1(b)_ shall not be
available to any party whose material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein at the time of such termination
substantially results in the failure of such condition to be fulfilled;

(c) at the election of Buyer or any Seller upon prior written notice, if any
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United States
Governmental Authority shall have issued a final Order permanently enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and
such final Order is or shall have become non-appealable;

(d) at the election of Buyer upon prior written notice to Sellers (so long as
Buyer is not in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ _9.1(a)_ not to be satisfied) if there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or any other agreement, document or certificate delivered pursuant
hereto so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ _8.1(a)_
or _Section 8.1(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured
within 30 calendar days after notice thereof or is not reasonably capable of
being cured prior to the Outside Date;

(e) at the election of any Seller upon prior written notice to Buyer (so long
as Sellers or the Companies are not in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or any other agreement, document or certificate delivered pursuant
hereto so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)_ not to be satisfied) if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any other agreement, document or certificate delivered pursuant hereto so as
to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ not to
be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within 30 calendar days
after notice thereof or is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date; or

(f) by the Sellers at any time during the three (3) business day period after
the Determination Date, if the SBA Average Closing Price on the Determination
Date is less than 75% of the SBA Average Price, subject to the following
provisions of this _Section 11.1(f)_. If the Sellers elect to terminate
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(f)_, they shall promptly provide written
notice to Parent (executed by each Seller) of such election whereupon the
Closing shall automatically be extended for three (3) Business Days from the
date of such notice. During the three (3) Business Days commencing with the
receipt of such notice, Parent shall have the option, but not the obligation,
to increase the Base Cash Consideration by an amount equal to: (i) the excess
of (x) 75% _multiplied by_ the SBA Average Price _over_ (y) the SBA Average
Closing 

 



103   Price, _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares comprising the Stock
Consideration. If Parent elects to increase the Base Cash Consideration, it
shall promptly, but in any case within the three-day period after receipt of
such notice, notify each Seller of its intent to increase the Base Cash
Consideration, whereupon such election shall be binding on Parent and Buyer,
the Sellers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
11.1(f)_ shall be terminated and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except for the adjustment to the Base Cash
Consideration). If the Sellers have elected to terminate this
Agreement pursuant this _Section 11.1(f)_ and Buyer has not elected to
increase the Base Cash Consideration, then this Agreement shall be null and
void, subject to _Section 11.2_.

 

11.2 _Survival After Termination_. Any termination of this Agreement under
_Section 11.1_ will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid
written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto, subject,
if applicable, to the cure period under _Section 11.1(d)_, _Section 11.1(e)_
or _Section 11.1(f)_. If this Agreement terminates pursuant to _Section
11.1_ and the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated:

(a) this Agreement shall become null and void and have no further force or
effect, except that (i) the third sentence of _Section 7.6(b)_ and the
provisions of _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_, _Section 7.4_, this  _Section
11.2_ and _Article XII_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement; and
(ii) nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for any
material breach of this Agreement by such party and each party shall be
entitled to pursue any and all rights and remedies therefor to which such
party may be entitled (and in the event of any such breach, the damages of the
other party, if any, shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses
or out-of-pocket costs);

(b) Buyer shall promptly return to Sellers and the Companies all books and
records and all other information furnished by Sellers, the Companies, their
respective agents, employees or Representatives (including all copies, if any)
and shall not use or disclose the information contained in such books and
records for any purpose or make such information available to any other
entity or person; and

(c) such termination shall not affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including any obligations to
return all books and records and other information furnished by Sellers, the
Companies, their respective agents, employees or Representatives), all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
with respect to the subject matter hereof exclusively in contract pursuant to
the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto

financial information regarding the Parents financial condition and results
of operations for the year-ended December 31, 2011.

 

12.5 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, superseded,
canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a
written instrument signed by the parties hereto or, in the case of a waiver,
by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such
right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

12.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to any conflict of laws rules thereof that might indicate the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby declare that it
is their intention that this Agreement shall be regarded as made under the

in interpreting its provisions in all cases where legal interpretation shall
be required. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that this Agreement

hereby further agree that New York state or United States Federal courts

12.7 _Release_. Other than as provided in _Article X_ of this Agreement,
effective as of the Closing, the Companies on behalf of themselves, and each
of their respective successors, assigns, current and future Subsidiaries and
current and future members and their direct or indirect owners (including
Buyer) (collectively, the " _Releasors_ ") unconditionally and forever
release, discharge and waive any and all claims of any nature whatsoever,
whether legal, equitable or otherwise, which the Releasors ever had, now have
or hereafter can, shall or may have against Sellers, their
respective Affiliates and Representatives (the " _Released Parties_ ")
arising at any time on or before the Closing. This release of claims extends
to any and all claims of any nature whatsoever, whether known, unknown or
capable or incapable of being known as of the Closing or thereafter. The
foregoing is a release of all claims of any nature whatsoever by the Releasors
against the Released Parties and includes any and all claims, actions,
demands, causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts,
reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies,
agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, expenses,
executions, affirmative defenses, demands and other obligations
or liabilities whatsoever, in law or equity, whether known or unknown,
including those caused by, arising from or related to any Releasors
relationship with the Released Parties (collectively, the " _Released Claims_
"). The Releasors hereby acknowledge that the Releasors may be unaware of or
may discover facts in addition to or different from those which the Releasors
now know or believe to be

 



108   true related to or concerning the Released Claims of the Released Parties,
and that such presently unknown or unappreciated facts could materially affect
the claims or defenses of a party or parties related to the Released Claims.
The Releasors hereby explicitly waive all rights with respect to the foregoing
release under the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (as
now worded and as hereafter amended) which section provides in pertinent
part: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH A CREDITOR DOES NOT
KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR." The Releasors agree that no provision of Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code shall affect the validity or scope of any other aspect
of the foregoing release. The Releasors hereby expressly waive any and all
rights which they may have under any other provision of state or federal law
providing the same or similar effect. The Releasors hereby acknowledge that
the Releasors have entered into this Release voluntarily, understands its
implications and acted with the assistance of counsel in reviewing and
considering its terms. The Releasors hereby acknowledge that the Releasors
have entered into this release voluntarily, understands its implications and
acted with the assistance of counsel in reviewing and considering its terms.

12.8 _Remedies_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including 
_Section 10.6_, (a) any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to
this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other
remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and (b) the exercise
by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise by it of any other remedy. If the Closing does not occur, (i) in no
event shall any debt financing source or any of its current, former or future
Affiliates and representatives have any liability to any Company, Company
Subsidiary or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates nor (ii) shall any
Company, Company Subsidiary or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
make any claim against any debt financing source or any of its Affiliates or
representatives for monetary damages or other remedy or relief, in each case,
in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

 

12.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
result and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, if any party breaches this Agreement, including its obligation
to consummate any of the Contemplated Transactions, the non-breaching party
or parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of an
injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance, without the
proof of actual damages, in addition to all other remedies available to the
parties at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach. Each party agrees
to (a) cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party or parties in
obtaining any such equitable remedy, and (b) waive any requirement for the
security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy.
Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an

(i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



109  12.10 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as set forth in _Section 7.12(b)_, this Agreement is not

parties; _provided_ , that, without the prior written consent of Sellers or
the Companies, Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Buyer without release of Buyers obligations hereunder.

 

12.11 _Interpretation_. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) each party
and its counsel reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and have contributed to its revision, (b) the rule of construction
to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party
shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement, and (c) the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to all
parties, regardless of which party was generally responsible for the
preparation of this Agreement.

 

12.12 _Severability of Provisions_. If any provision or any portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining portion of such provision and the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not be affected thereby. If the application of any provision
or any portion of any provision of this Agreement to any Person or
circumstance shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the application of such
provision or portion of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected
thereby.

 

12.13 _No Personal Liability_. This Agreement (and each agreement, certificate
and instrument delivered pursuant hereto) shall not create or be deemed to
create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of any
Representative or investor of any party hereto.

12.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 12.7_
no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or shall, confer any third
party beneficiary or other rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto; _provided,_ however, that (i) the sources of Parents debt
financing for the Contemplated Transactions shall be considered third party
beneficiaries with respect to  _Section 12.1(b)_, _Section 12.6_ and
_Section 12.8_, and (ii) the DAS Purchaser shall be considered a third party
beneficiary with respect to _Section 7.16_.

 

12.15 _Action by the Sellers_. Except for the rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_,  _(c)_ , or _(e)_ and exercise any
remedies upon breach by any party of this Agreement, which actions may be
taken by any Seller, any provision of this Agreement that permits or requires
consent or notice from or to, or any other action on the part of, Sellers
(including any rights as an Indemnitor pursuant to _Article X_) shall only be
effective if provided or taken by each Seller in writing.

 



110  12.16 _Parent Guarantee_.

 

(a) Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each of the
Sellers, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the performance of, and
compliance with, all obligations, covenants, warranties and undertakings of
Buyer contained in this Agreement (i) which are to be completed prior to or at
the Closing, and (ii) with respect to Buyers obligations under _Section
2.7(b)_ (the " _Guaranty_ "). To the extent that Buyer fails to pay or perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement when due, Parent shall promptly
pay to the Sellers the amount due with respect to such Sellers or otherwise
perform such obligation without any demand or notice whatsoever. Parent hereby
waives promptness, diligence, demand, protest and notice as to the obligations
and covenants guaranteed hereby and acceptance of this Guaranty, the right to
require the Sellers to exhaust remedies against any other Person and waives
any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available
to, or a discharge of, Parent as a guarantor. Parent hereby waives all claims
of waiver, release, surrender, abstraction or compromise and all set-offs,

contained therein except for those set forth in this Agreement.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase and
Sale Agreement, dated as of February [], 2012 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by
and among Buyer, Parent, Mobilitie Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Mobilitie I"), Mobilitie Investments II, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Mobilitie II"), MPGJ-I, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("MPGJ I"), MPMA-I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("MPMA I"), MPGJ-II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("MPGJ

Sellers wish to sell to Buyer, and Buyer wishes to purchase from Sellers, the
membership interests of Mobilitie I, Mobilitie II, MPGJ I, MPGJ II and MPMA I
(the "Transferred Interests"), as applicable; and

 

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement provides that the Escrow Amounts (as defined
below) will be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent to provide the source of
payment for certain payment obligations of Sellers that may exist pursuant to
Section 2.6 and Section 10.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto desire to establish the terms and conditions
pursuant to which such escrow accounts shall be established and maintained.

 



 AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:



     | 1. | Escrow Accounts. 
---|---|--- 

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately-available funds, to the bank
account set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "Purchase Price
Escrow Account"), an amount in cash equal to [three million dollars
($3,000,000)] (together with investment income earned thereon pursuant to the
terms hereof, the "Purchase Price Escrow Amount"). The Purchase Price Escrow
Amount shall be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof as the
source of payment in respect of Sellers obligations, if any, for any
adjustments to Purchase Price due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.6(g) of the
Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount and to hold the Purchase Price Escrow Amount in
the Purchase Price Escrow Account, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Escrow Agent, to the securities account set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto
(the "Indemnification Escrow Account" and together with the Purchase Price
Escrow Account, the "Escrow Accounts") [] shares of Parent Common Stock (the
"Escrow Shares") (which shall have an aggregate deemed value (the "Initial
Escrow Amount") at such time equal to $[]) based on the SBA Average Closing
Price), as the same shall be subject to reduction on the six-month anniversary
of the Closing pursuant to this Agreement (together with any additional Escrow
Shares deposited pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Agreement or, to the
extent any cash is deposited pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement, any
investment income earned thereon pursuant to the terms hereof the
"Indemnification Escrow Amount" and together with the Purchase Price Escrow
Amount, the "Escrow Amounts"). The Escrow Shares and any cash deposited
pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement shall be held by Escrow Agent pursuant
to the terms hereof as the sole source of payment in respect of
Sellers indemnification obligations, if any, set forth in Section 10.2(a) of
the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the
Escrow Shares and to hold the Escrow Shares in the Indemnification Escrow
Account, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly specified, for all purposes of this Agreement each Escrow
Share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the SBA Average Closing Price
(as adjusted for stock splits (including reverse stock splits), combinations
of shares, reclassifications of outstanding shares, recapitalizations or
similar transactions).

(c) The Escrow Amounts will be segregated from other assets of the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent agrees to hold and administer the Escrow Amounts
subject to the terms of this Agreement.  2\. Release of Escrow Amounts with Respect to Purchase Price Adjustment. 

(a) In the event that the Final Purchase Price is equal to or greater than the
Closing Purchase Price, then Sellers and Buyer shall promptly (but in any
event within three (3) Business Days) jointly give written notice to the
Escrow Agent (the "Company Adjustment Notice") with instruction that the
Escrow Agent release from the Purchase Price Escrow Account to Sellers, pro
rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit C_ (which
percentages may be adjusted by a joint written instruction executed by each
Seller), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts
designated by Sellers, all of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount. Attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ are the names, titles and specimen signature of each of
the persons who are authorized to execute written notices and directions to
the Escrow Agent on behalf of Sellers and Buyer, respectively.

(b) In the event that the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing
Purchase Price (such shortfall, the "Buyer Adjustment Amount"), then Sellers
and Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days)
jointly give written notice to the Escrow Agent (the "Buyer Adjustment
Notice") with instruction that the Escrow Agent release from the Purchase
Price Escrow Account the Buyer Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Buyer in
writing, and the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account to Sellers, pro
rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit C_ (which
percentages may be adjusted by a joint written instruction executed by each
Seller), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Sellers in writing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the Buyer Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Purchase Price Escrow Amount, then Buyer shall be entitled to be
reimbursed from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (in the case of Escrow
Shares, based on the SBA Average Closing Price without regard to the Basket
Amount) by including joint written instructions in the Buyer Adjustment
Notice setting forth the applicable number of Escrow Shares to release to
Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Amount. Attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
are the names, titles and specimen signature of each of the persons who are
authorized to execute written notices and directions to the Escrow Agent on
behalf of Sellers and Buyer, respectively.

 

3\. Release of Escrow Shares with Respect to Indemnification Claims.

 

(a) Delivery of Claim Notice. If any Buyer Indemnitee has incurred or suffered
any Losses under Section 10.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement for which such
Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification thereunder, Buyer shall, on
behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee and on or prior to the expiration of the
Escrow Period, give written notice of such claim (a "Claim Notice") to
Sellers and the Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall state in reasonable
detail (i) the basis for such claim, (ii) the amount of Losses incurred or
suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee or, if not determinable, a reasonable, good
faith estimate thereof (the "Claimed Amount"), (iii) the amount of Escrow
Shares and cash, if applicable, required to satisfy such Losses, and (iv)
delivery instructions for any distribution of Escrow Shares and cash, if
applicable. No Buyer Indemnitee may make any new claim for Losses against the
Indemnification Escrow Account after the expiration of the Escrow Period.

(b) Response Notice; Uncontested Claims. Within thirty (30) days of the date a
Claim Notice is received (the "Response Date") in accordance with Section
3(a), Sellers shall  provide to Buyer and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response
Notice") in which Sellers shall either: (i) agree that a specified amount of
the Escrow Shares and/or cash equal in value to the Claimed Amount (the
"Agreed Amount") may be released from the Indemnification Escrow Account to
Buyer Indemnitee, (ii) agree that a specified amount of Escrow Shares and/or
cash equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount may be released from
the Indemnification Escrow Account to Buyer Indemnitee, or (iii) contest that
any of the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, may be released from the
Indemnification Escrow Account to Buyer Indemnitee. Sellers may contest the
release of Escrow Shares and/or cash based upon (i) a good faith belief that
all or such portion of the Claimed Amount does not constitute Losses for which
the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under Section 10.2(a) of
the Purchase Agreement, or (ii) any incorrect valuation or calculation of the
amount of Escrow Shares and/or cash to be released. If no Response Notice is
delivered by Sellers to the Escrow Agent by the Response Date, Sellers shall
be deemed to have agreed that the amount of the Escrow Shares and/or cash are
equal in value to the entire Claimed Amount and may be released from the
Indemnification Escrow Account to Buyer in satisfaction of such claim(s).

(c) Uncontested Claim. If Sellers agree in the Response Notice, or are deemed
to have agreed pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3(b) above, that the
applicable number of the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, may be
released from the Indemnification Escrow Account to Buyer, the Escrow Agent
shall, no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt or deemed receipt
of the Response Notice, transfer, deliver, and assign to such Buyer (i) such
number of Escrow Shares, cash or combination of Escrow Shares and cash (as
determined by the Sellers), an applicable amount of cash, if any, included in
the Indemnification Escrow Account) as provided in the Claim Notice or (ii)
such number of Escrow Shares, cash or combination of Escrow Shares and cash
(as determined by the Sellers) as provided in the Response Notice,
as applicable.

(d) Partially Contested Claims. If Sellers in the Response Notice agree that
the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, equal to part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount may be released from the Indemnification Escrow Account to such
Buyer Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, no later than three (3) Business
Days after receipt of the Response Notice, transfer, deliver, and assign to
such Buyer Indemnitee such number of the Escrow Shares, cash or combination of
Escrow Shares and cash (as determined by the Sellers) equal to the Agreed
Amount and subject to reduction pursuant to Section 3(e).

(e) Contested Claims. If Sellers in the Response Notice contest all or any
part of any claim in a Claims Notice (a "Contested Claim"), the Escrow Agent
shall not take any action regarding the release of Escrow Shares and cash, if
any, to Buyer except as hereafter specified or with respect to any uncontested
portions of any claim in a Claims Notice, which uncontested portions may be
released in accordance with Section 3(d) above. Until the Escrow Agent
receives (x) delivery of a copy of a settlement agreement or any other written
instructions executed by Buyer and Sellers instructing the Escrow Agent as to
the resolution of such Contested Claim and the disbursement of the Escrow
Shares, cash or combination of Escrow Shares and cash (as determined by the
Sellers) in respect of such Contested Claim (the "Settlement Agreement") or
(y) delivery of a copy of the final non-appealable award of a court of
competent jurisdiction resolving the Contested Claim (accompanied by a
certificate from the   presenting party to the effect that the order is final and non-appealable
and that a copy of such order has been delivered to the other parties hereto),
(the "Final Adjudication"), the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold in the
Indemnification Escrow Account the Escrow Shares and/or cash, as applicable,
required to be retained in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(f) Cash in Lieu of Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, at any time that Escrow Shares are to be released and delivered to
Buyer pursuant to Section 3 hereof, Sellers may direct that, to the extent
available in the Indemnification Escrow Account, such amounts be satisfied, in
whole or in part, with and paid in a like amount of cash. 

4\. Release of Escrow Shares after Six Months.

 

On the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date hereof,
Sellers and Buyer shall jointly give written notice to the Escrow Agent (the
"Six-Month Release Notice") with instruction that the Escrow Agent release
from the Indemnification Escrow Account and deliver to Sellers, pro rata in
accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit C_ (which percentages
may be adjusted by a joint written instruction executed by each Seller) that
number of Escrow Shares and, to the extent there are not sufficient Escrow
Shares in the Indemnification Escrow Account, cash, if any, such that the
amount and value of all Escrow Shares and cash remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account thereafter equals sixty-six and 2/3 percent
(66.67%) of the Indemnification Escrow Amount plus an amount equal to the
amount of (i) all then pending Contested Claims and (ii) all Agreed Amounts
that have not been satisfied and paid as of such date (the "Reduced Escrow
Amount"). After Receipt of the Six-Month Release Notice, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly transfer, deliver, assign and release to Sellers, pro rata in
accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit C_ (which percentages
may be adjusted by a joint written instruction executed by each Seller), such
number of Escrow Shares, cash or combination of Escrow Shares and cash (as
determined by the Sellers) as provided in the Six-Month Release Notice.

5\. Election to Sell Escrow Shares by Sellers.

The parties acknowledge that Sellers, in their sole discretion, may determine
to effect a sale of all or any portion of the Escrow Shares at any time, free
and clear of any encumbrances by virtue of this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement. In the
event that Sellers provide written notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer that
it intends to effect such a sale of Escrow Shares, Buyer and Parent agree to
reasonably cooperate with Sellers and the Escrow Agent, and to take such
further actions as are reasonably requested by Sellers in order to effect the
sale of the Escrow Shares directly from the Indemnification Escrow Account by
the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Sellers, subject to the restrictions
set forth in Section 2.11 of the Purchase Agreement. Sellers shall have the
sole right and obligation to negotiate the price and terms pursuant to which
the Escrow Shares shall be sold. To the extent that Sellers effect the sale of
all, but not less than all, of the Escrow Shares in a single block trade
within five (5) business days after the date of this Agreement, and at least
one of the Parent Approved Underwriters was offered the opportunity to
participate in such sale, for each Escrow Share so sold, Buyer and Sellers
shall jointly give written notice to the Escrow Agent with instruction that
the Escrow Agent deposit the proceeds of such sale (net of any  underwriting discounts and commissions) into the Indemnification Escrow
Account. With respect to any other sale of Escrow Shares, for each Escrow
Share so sold, (x) the Escrow Agent shall release and pay to Sellers an
amount in cash equal to the excess of the per share net proceeds from such
sale over the SBA Average Closing Price and deposit any remaining sales
proceeds into the Indemnification Escrow Account and, if applicable, (y)
Sellers agree to deposit into the Indemnification Escrow Account an amount in
cash per Escrow Share sold equal to the excess of the SBA Average Closing
Price over the per share net proceeds from such sale.

 

6\. Investment of Escrow Amount.

Until such time as the entire Escrow Accounts being held by the Escrow Agent
have been released, the Escrow Agent shall, as soon as reasonably possible,
invest and reinvest any cash that may be included in the Escrow Accounts from
time to time in: (i) United States Treasury Bills with maturities not
exceeding 26 weeks, (ii) short-term obligations in registered form (other than
U.S. Treasury Bills) issued or guaranteed as to interest and principal by the
government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
(iii) short-term non-agency mortgage-backed securities in registered form
rated AAA (or the equivalent investment grade) by Standard and Poors
Corporation or Aaa (or the equivalent investment grade) by Moodys Investor
Service, Inc., or (iv) short-term (less than 90 days) certificates of deposit
issued by United States banks or trust companies having a combined capital
and surplus of not less than $100,000,000. The Escrow Agent is herein directed
and instructed to initially invest and reinvest Escrow Funds in the
investments indicated in _Exhibits A_ and _B_. The Escrow Agent may make any
and all investments permitted by this Section 6 through its own bond or
investment department. The Escrow Agent shall have the power to sell or
liquidate the foregoing investments whenever the Escrow Agent shall be
required to distribute all or any portion of Escrow Accounts in accordance
with this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
provide, without any additional cost, monthly statements to Buyer and Sellers
reflecting balances, earnings and interest and any transactions with respect
to the Purchase Price Escrow Account or Indemnification Escrow Account and
including transaction details with respect to any such transactions.

 

7\. Taxes.

(a) Payment of Taxes by Buyer. Buyer shall be deemed the owners of the Escrow
Shares and/or cash in the Escrow Accounts, as applicable, and shall be
responsible for the preparation, filing and payment of all tax returns and
taxes due associated with such Escrow Shares and/or cash ("Taxes"). It shall
be the sole responsibility of Buyer to report all income, if any, that is
earned on, or derived from, any cash included in the Escrow Amounts that is
allocable to Buyer, in the taxable year or years in which such income is
properly includible and pay any Taxes attributable thereto. The Escrow Agent,
in order to assist Buyer in the preparation of tax forms and the payment of
Taxes, shall take such steps and provide such forms to Buyer as directed by
Buyer to make all such filings and payments accurate and timely. Further, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to make such withholdings as it deems necessary
and proper from any distribution of the Escrow Shares and/or cash in the
Escrow Accounts, as applicable, to comply with its own obligations under the
United States Internal Revenue Code. (b) Payment of Taxes by Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any and all
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any cash and/or Escrow Shares included
in the Escrow Amounts that is released to Sellers in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

8\. Certain Additional Agreements.

Buyer, Parent and Sellers do such things and take such actions, and will
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent such instructions and certificates
hereunder, as may be reasonably required to give effect to the provisions of
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the execution and delivery of
appropriate stock powers and written letters of direction to Parents transfer
agent and registrar in respect of the cancellation, issuance and delivery of
new stock certificates and such other matters as may be necessary to effect
the provisions hereof.

9\. Escrow Agent.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, including,
without limitation, any duty to review or interpret the Purchase Agreement.
Except for this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is not a party to, or bound by,
any agreement that may be required under, evidenced by, or arise out of the
Purchase Agreement.

 

(b) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions from any of the undersigned with
respect to the Escrow Accounts, which, in its opinion, are in conflict with
any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from
taking any action until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by a
joint direction of Buyer and Sellers or by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
request, waiver, consent, receipt or other document reasonably believed in
good faith by the Escrow Agent to be signed by the proper party or parties.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error or judgment or for any
act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith or for any mistake of
fact or law, or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing in
connection herewith, except its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and the Escrow Agent shall have no duties to anyone except those
signing this Agreement (and their respective heirs, successors and permitted
assigns).

(d) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel in the event of any dispute or
question as to the construction of this Agreement, or the Escrow Agents
duties hereunder, and the Escrow Agent shall incur no liability and shall be
fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted in good faith in
accordance with the opinion and instructions of such counsel.

 

(e) In the event of any disagreement between the undersigned or any of them,
and/or any other person, resulting in adverse claims and demands being made
in connection with or for the Escrow Shares or the cash in the Escrow
Accounts, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled at its option to refuse to comply
with any such claim or demand, so long as such disagreement shall
continue, and in so doing the Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable for
damages or interest  to the undersigned or any of them or to any person named herein for its
failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting or adverse demands. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue so to refrain and refuse so to act
until all differences shall have been resolved by agreement and the Escrow
Agent shall have been notified thereof in writing signed by Buyer and Sellers
or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of such
disagreement which continues for sixty (60) days or more, the Escrow Agent or
any other party in its discretion may file a suit in interpleader or other
appropriate action for the purpose of having the respective rights of the
claimants adjudicated, if the Escrow Agent determines such action to be
appropriate under the circumstances, and may deposit with the court all
documents and property held hereunder. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, agree to pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Escrow Agent in such action, including reasonable attorneys fees, it
being understood that the parties will use reasonable efforts to cause such
costs and expenses to be included and apportioned between Buyer and Sellers
in the judgment in any such action (and absent such apportionment, Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand shall bear equal shares of such
costs and expenses).

 

(f) The Escrow Agent is hereby indemnified by Buyer and Sellers from all
losses, costs and expenses that may be incurred by it as a result of its
involvement in any arbitration or litigation arising from the performance of
its duties hereunder, provided that such losses, costs and expenses shall not
have resulted from the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence
of the Escrow Agent. Such indemnification shall be borne in equal proportions
by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, and shall survive
termination of this Agreement until extinguished by any applicable statute of
limitations. 

(g) The Escrow Agent does not own or have any interest in the Escrow Accounts
or the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, but is serving as escrow holder
only, having only possession thereof and agreeing to hold and distribute the
Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. This paragraph shall survive notwithstanding
any termination of this Agreement or the resignation of the Escrow Agent.

(h) The Escrow Agent (and any successor escrow agent) may resign by
furnishing written notice of its resignation to Buyer and Sellers, and Buyer
and Sellers may remove the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a
joint written notice of its removal along with payment of all fees and
expenses to which it is entitled through the date of termination. No
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent hereunder and the acceptance by
such successor of the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if no replacement Escrow Agent is appointed in accordance with
this Section 9(h) within thirty (30) days after the Escrow Agent gives written
notice to Buyer and Sellers of its resignation or is otherwise removed, the
Escrow Agent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of
Buyer and Sellers (which shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
such expenses) for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon Buyer and Sellers. Such
resignation or removal, as the case may be, shall be effective upon the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agents sole
responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Amounts and to
deliver the same to a successor Escrow Agent as shall be appointed by Buyer
and Sellers, as evidenced by a joint written notice delivered to the
Escrow Agent, or in accordance with the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. (i) The Escrow Agent hereby accepts its appointment and agrees to act as
escrow agent under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Shares and cash. Buyer and Sellers shall
split the payment for Escrow Agents services hereunder the Escrow Agents
compensation set forth in  _Schedule E_ hereto. Buyer and Sellers further
agree to reimburse the Escrow Agent for all reasonable and documented out of
pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Escrow
Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable and
documented fees and out of pocket expenses and disbursements of its counsel).

10. Dividends and Voting

(a) Dividends, Interest, Etc. Any securities distributable in respect of or in
exchange for any of the Escrow Shares, whether by way of stock splits or
otherwise (excluding stock dividends), shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent,
who shall hold such securities in the Indemnification Escrow Account. Such
securities shall be issued in the name of the Sellers, and shall be
considered Escrow Shares. Any stock dividends, cash dividends or other
property shall be distributed to Sellers.

(b) Voting of Shares. On any matter brought before Sellers for a vote, Sellers
shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent ("Voting Notice") setting
forth the manner in which the Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares.
Sellers shall deliver the Voting Notice to the Escrow Agent at least five (5)
days prior to the date of the taking of any vote (the "Voting Notice Date").
The Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares in proportions as indicated by
Sellers. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to vote any of the Escrow
Shares if no Voting Notice is received prior to the Voting Notice Date or if
such notice does not clearly set forth the manner in which the Escrow Agent
shall vote the Escrow Shares.

11\. Termination and Release of Escrow Shares. 

This Agreement shall terminate upon the later of (i) the expiration of the
Escrow Period or (ii) the delivery of all amounts then remaining in the
Purchase Price Escrow Account and the Indemnification Escrow Account by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement. Within three (3) Business Days
after the expiration of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Sellers, pro rata in accordance with the percentages set forth in _Exhibit
C_ (which percentages may be adjusted by a joint written instruction executed
by each Seller), on behalf of Buyer, all of the Escrow Shares and cash then
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account, including any shares received
with respect to the Escrow Shares prior to the termination date pursuant to
stock splits or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Claim Notice
has been given prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period and such claim has
not yet been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Indemnification
Escrow Account after the expiration of the Escrow Period the number of
Escrow Shares and/or cash, if applicable, equal in the aggregate to the
Claimed Amount in a Claims Notice or Contested Claim, as the case may be, in
each case without regard to any potential insurance payments related thereto
(as well as any amounts the Escrow Agent reasonably determines are necessary
to satisfy the fees and expenses contemplated by Section 9), which has not
then been resolved. 12\. Nature of Interest in Escrow Amounts; Improper Withdrawal of Funds.

 

It is the intent of Buyer and Sellers that (i) Buyers interest in the Escrow
Amounts and (ii) Sellers interest in the Escrow Amounts is, in each case,
merely a contingent right to payment, and that neither a voluntary nor
involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law
nor the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or similar official in
respect of Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be (a "Bankruptcy Event"), shall
increase either Buyers or the Sellers respective interest in the Escrow
Amounts or affect, modify, convert or otherwise change the contingent nature
of its respective right to payment of the Escrow Amounts in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Escrow Agent distributes or otherwise releases any
Escrow Amounts to a party or any of its successors or assigns (including,
without limitation, upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event) in breach of
the terms of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, then such party
covenants and agrees (i) to hold any such funds in trust for the exclusive
benefit of the other party in an account separate and apart from such partys
other assets, (ii) not to comingle such funds with such partys other assets
and (iii) to promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day)
return such funds to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow Accounts.

 

13\. Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement (except with respect to
the Escrow Agent), constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or
contemporaneous negotiations, correspondence, understandings, agreements or
representations and warranties, by or among the parties, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, modification, alteration
or waiver of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
unless the same shall be in writing and duly executed by the parties hereto
or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. In case of any
discrepancy or conflict between this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
with respect to the subject matter hereof, this Agreement shall govern.

 

14\. Succession and Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
named herein and their respective successors. No provision of this Agreement
is intended to, or shall, confer any third party beneficiary or other rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto. No party may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other
parties.

15\. Counterparts.

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement
by facsimile or other electronic communication shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 16\. Headings.

 

The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

17\. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of
laws. The parties hereto hereby declare that it is their intention that this
Agreement shall be regarded as made under the laws of the State of Delaware
and that the laws of said state shall be applied in interpreting
its provisions in all cases where legal interpretation shall be required.
Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that this Agreement involves at least
$100,000, and (b) that this Agreement has been entered into by the parties
hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. §2708\. Each of the parties hereto
hereby agrees (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service
of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and
(b) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service of
process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified or registered mail
in the manner provided in Section 21 of this Agreement, and that service made
pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above shall to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto: (a) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) with respect to all actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; (b) agrees that all claims with respect to any such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts and agrees not to
commence any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby except in such courts; (c) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action
or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and irrevocably and unconditionally waives the defense of an
inconvenient forum; and (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

18. Severability.

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in
any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the  court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have
the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

19\. Specific Performance.

Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other party would be
damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and
the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at
law or in equity.

20\. Construction; Definitions.
