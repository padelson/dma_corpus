ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBOC and the CBCA, at the
Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence
under the Laws of the State of Texas. As of the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Company shall cease.

 

1.2 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date and at
a place to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than
five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Closing, but in all cases subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof),
unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Company and Parent shall file
or cause to be filed (a) with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado
a statement of merger containing such information as is required by the
relevant provisions of the CBCA in order to effect the Merger (the "
_Statement of Merger_ ") and (b) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Texas a certificate of merger containing such information as is required by
the relevant provisions of the TBOC in order to effect the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such time as
is specified in the Statement of Merger and the Certificate of Merger (such
time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the second amended and restated certificate of formation
of Parent (" _Parent Certificate of Formation_ ") and second amended and
restated bylaws of Parent (" _Parent Bylaws_ ") as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors and
assigns are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal. The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the Surviving Corporations certificate of formation and bylaws.

1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the TBOC and the CBCA.

 



2 1.7 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Company or the holder of any of
the following securities:

 

(a) _No Effect on Parent Equity_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall, subject to Section
1.7(d), be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in cash without interest. All shares of Company Common Stock
that have been converted in the Merger shall be cancelled automatically and
shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to those shares, other than the right to receive following
Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration, upon surrender of their
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Company Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by Company as treasury shares or
otherwise owned by Parent or Company (other than (i) shares held in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) shares
held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Company in respect of a debt
previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Per
Share Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a Company
shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Article 113 of the CBCA (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to
the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA and this Section 1.7(d)), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to demand or receive the fair value of such shares
of Company Common Stock under the CBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such
share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 1.7(b), without any
interest thereon. Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
notices to exercise dissenters rights

 



3  in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to the CBCA and
received by Company relating to shareholders dissenters rights and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with Dissenting
Shareholders with respect to demands for fair value under the CBCA. Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 to pay for shares of Company Common
Stock for which dissenters rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent upon demand.

 

1.8 _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time,
each award of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or lapse restrictions
(each a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, to the extent not vested,
become fully vested, and shall be canceled without any action on the part of
any holder or beneficiary thereof and converted in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Award, less applicable Tax withholding,
treating such shares in the same manner as all other outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock for such purposes.

 

1.9 _Bank Mergers_. Immediately following the Effective Time, or at such
later time as Parent may determine in its sole discretion, each of The First
National Bank of Durango, a national bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Company (" _Colorado Bank_ "), and Bank of New Mexico, a New Mexico-chartered
bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Company (" _New Mexico Bank_ ", and
with Colorado Bank, the " _Company Banks_ "), will merge (each merger, a "
_Bank Merger_ ", and collectively, the " _Bank Mergers_ ") with and into TBK
Bank, SSB, a Texas-chartered state savings bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ ") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger to
be agreed upon by Parent and Company and executed prior to the Closing Date,
which agreement shall be in form and substance customary for mergers similar
to the Bank Mergers, including that such Bank Mergers shall be conditioned on
the prior occurrence of the Merger. Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity
in each of the Bank Mergers and, following the Bank Mergers, the separate
corporate existence of the Company Banks shall cease. Prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall cause the Company Banks, and Parent shall cause Parent
Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such other
documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested and necessary to

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to or immediately following
the Closing, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") pursuant
to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing that is reasonably
acceptable to Company (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") immediately available
funds equal to the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration (collectively, the
" _Exchange Fund_ "), and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely
deliver the aggregate Per

 



4  Share Merger Consideration for exchange in accordance with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Companys written consent, Parent may at
any time prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the distribution of the
Proxy Statement (or the thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery by Company
of a written consent as contemplated by Section 6.3(d)) elect to act as Paying
Agent by delivery of written notice to Company, in which case Parent shall,
or at Parents request Company shall, deliver to each Holder a Letter of
Transmittal and Parent shall fulfill the obligations of the Paying Agent
hereunder. If Parent makes the foregoing election prior to the distribution
of a Proxy Statement, Company shall, if elected by Company or requested by
Parent, distribute the Letter of Transmittal together with such Proxy
Statement.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.1, not later than twenty (20) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
(collectively, the " _Holders_ ") of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ") that will be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7
(i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate.

(b) Upon the occurrence of (i) five (5) Business Days after surrender to
the Paying Agent of its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, if such surrender occurs after the Closing, or (ii) the
Closing, if its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal are submitted no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.2(i), the Paying Agent shall pay and
distribute to such Holder of Company Common Stock the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
its Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
Company, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.2(b) in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered Holder of
the Certificate and establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has
been paid or is not applicable; _provided_ that any transfer or other similar
Taxes payable in connection with the Merger (other than such Taxes required
to be paid by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered Holder of the Company Common Stock) shall be
borne and paid by Parent.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding

 



5  immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of
Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.7 and the
procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent; _provided_ that to the extent at any time prior to
such first anniversary any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, the Paying Agent shall first
notify Parent and, at Parents option, such portion shall instead be paid to
Parent. Any former shareholders of Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the
Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None of Parent,
Company, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.

 

(f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as Parent or Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) Subject to Section 2.2(i) and the terms of the Paying Agent
Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have
the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and
compliance by any Company shareholder with the procedures and instructions
set forth herein and therein and (ii) the method of payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 

(h) In the case of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that are not
represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to the
requirements and procedures of Article I and Article II as are necessary or
appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that Article I and
Article II have with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that are
represented by Certificates.

(i) In order to facilitate the payment on the Closing Date of the Merger
Consideration to Companys shareholders, the Letter of Transmittal and
accompanying materials shall provide shareholders with the option, without
prejudice to any other rights they may have, to submit a completed Letter
of Transmittal accompanied by Certificates to be surrendered with the Letter
of Transmittal to Company (with a copy to Parent and the Paying Agent) at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, such documents to be
held in escrow pending, and released immediately upon, the Closing. Once such
documents have been released at Closing, Parent shall or shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay on the Closing Date the Merger Consideration applicable to
the shares so surrendered.

 



6 2.3 _Determination of Merger Consideration_. No later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an
estimate of the Closing Tangible Book Value and reasonable supporting
documentation for its estimate. During such ten (10) Business Day period and
in any event prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Company shall cooperate in
good faith to agree on the Closing Tangible Book Value. To the extent no
agreement is reached prior to the Closing Date, (i) the amount of Merger
Consideration to be deposited with the Paying Agent by Parent shall be based
on the Closing Tangible Book Value calculated by Company; (ii) the amount of
Merger Consideration to be paid by the Paying Agent to holders of
Company Common Stock shall be based on the Closing Tangible Book Value
calculated by Parent; (iii) the disagreement shall be submitted to a mutually
agreed independent accounting firm for determination within five (5) Business
Days (together with such information as the accounting firm may request) and
(iv) in the event that such independent accounting firm determines that the
Closing Tangible Book Value exceeds Parents calculation of Closing Tangible
Book Value (subject to the following sentence), Parent shall promptly
thereafter cause the Paying Agent to distribute (x) such excess to holders of
Company Common Stock on a pro rata basis and (y) distribute to Parent the
excess, if any, of Companys calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value over
such independent accounting firms calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value.
The determination of the accounting firm shall be final and shall not be
higher than Companys calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value nor lower
than Parents calculation of Closing Tangible Book Value.

 

2.4 _Withholding_. The Paying Agent, Parent and Parents Affiliates shall
be entitled to deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from
the Per Share Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Paying Agent, Parent or
Parents applicable Affiliate, as the case may be, is required to deduct or
withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the applicable Tax authorities, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.
Parent shall provide Company with notice no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to Closing of any intended withholding.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the applicable section of the Disclosure Schedule (it
being understood that any information disclosed pursuant to any section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in any
other section where such disclosure would reasonably appear on its face to be
an applicable disclosure or qualification thereunder, whether or not repeated
or cross-referenced under such section), Company hereby represents to Parent
as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Colorado. Colorado Bank is a national
bank duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the United States. New Mexico Bank is a New Mexico-chartered bank duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of New Mexico. The deposit accounts of the Company Banks are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the Deposit Insurance Fund to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments required
in connection therewith have been paid by the Company Banks when due. Company
is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended. Each of Company and the Company Banks has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate all of its
respective properties and assets and to carry on its respective business as it
is now being conducted. Each of Company and the Company Banks is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of Company
(the " _Company Articles of Incorporation_ ") and the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been furnished or made available to Parent.
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Articles
of Incorporation or Company Bylaws.

(b) The Company Banks are the only Subsidiaries of Company (each, a "
_Company Subsidiary_ " and collectively the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ").
Company is the owner of all outstanding capital stock or other equity
securities of each such Company Subsidiary, options, warrants, stock
appreciation rights, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of
any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible
into, shares of any capital stock or other equity securities of such Company
Subsidiary, or contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
such Company Subsidiary may become bound to issue additional shares of its
capital stock or other equity securities, or options, warrants, scrip, rights
to subscribe to, calls or commitments for any shares of its capital stock or
other equity securities and the identity of the parties to any such agreements
or arrangements. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other securities evidencing ownership of Company Subsidiaries are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and such shares or other securities are
owned by Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any lien,
claim, charge, option, encumbrance, mortgage, pledge or security interest or
other restriction of any kind (" _Lien_ ") with respect thereto. Each Company
Subsidiary (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation,
partnership or limited liability company or other legal entity under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed and qualified to do
business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified (except for jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect) and (iii)
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. A true, correct and
complete copy of the articles or certificate of 

 



8  incorporation or certificate of trust and bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of each Company Subsidiary, as amended and currently in effect, has
been delivered and made available to Parent. Except for its interests in
Company Subsidiaries, Company does not as of the date of this Agreement own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership
interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any Person. As
used in this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean, when used with respect to
any party, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
association, joint venture or other business entity of which (i) such first
Person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions or (ii)  such first Person is or directly or indirectly has the
power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing member.

 3.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Company consists
of 100,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share, of Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") and 100,000 shares of non-voting cumulative
preferred stock, $100.00 par value per share, of Company (the " _Preferred
Stock_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, there are (a) 23,066 shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding (including 230 shares subject to
outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards) and (b) no shares of Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding; and no other shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having
the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Company may vote are
issued or outstanding. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, stock
appreciation rights, warrants, restricted stock units, phantom units, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities of Company, or otherwise obligating Company to issue,
transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or to register under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any such securities. Except for the
Voting and Support Agreement, there are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting
or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of Company.
No trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of Company or any Company
Subsidiary are issued or outstanding.

Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties, assets or business activities may be bound or affected, except,
in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, funding,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any

"), the United States Department of the Treasury, the United States Department
of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, any participant
in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party. No Company Benefit Plan is

trust with respect to any such fiduciary account.

 

(c) Company and each insured depository Subsidiary of Company is "well-

a rating of "satisfactory" or better pursuant to its next CRA compliance
examination.

Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning Parent, Company and their respective Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective

apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, subject to applicable Law, (i) each of Parent and Company

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to require any party hereto to take any action, or commit to
take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with

require a material modification of, or impose any material limitation or
restriction on, the activities, governance, legal structure, compensation or
fee arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) (any
of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the following shall not be deemed to be included in the preceding list

term, requirement, provision or condition that applies generally to bank

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Company agrees to provide
Parent and its Representatives, from time to time prior to the Effective
Time, such information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial
conditions and operations and such access to the properties, books
and records and personnel of Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall
reasonably request, which access shall occur with reasonable advance notice,
during normal business hours and shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Company or its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Company shall not be required to (or to cause
any of its Subsidiaries to) provide such information or access to the extent
that doing so would violate applicable Law or any contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party or result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege, in which case the parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements.

 



36 (b) Parent and Company shall comply with, and shall cause their
respective Representatives, directors, officers and employees to comply with,
all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
set forth therein.

 

(c) From and after the date hereof, Company shall provide Parent within ten
(10) Business Days of the end of each calendar month with (1) a stand-alone
unaudited, unconsolidated balance sheet of Company and stand-alone unaudited
balance sheets for each of its Subsidiaries as of the end of such calendar
month, (2) the unaudited AOCI of Company as of the end of such calendar
month, and (3) the unaudited general ledger of Company as of the end of such
calendar month (collectively, the " _Unaudited Monthly Financial Statements_
"). The Unaudited Monthly Financial Statements shall (i) be prepared from,
and in accordance with, the books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) with respect to the foregoing clause (1), fairly present in all material

supporting information reasonably required for Parents review of the
Unaudited Monthly Financial Statements upon reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Company shall, prior to the Closing,
provide Parent with final invoices from any broker, finder, financial advisor
or investment banking firm or legal or accounting firm engaged by Company, or
to whom Company has or will make payment, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) Company shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
Companys independent auditor to, cooperate with Parent in connection with the
preparation of financial statements of Company and pro forma financial
statements, if any, that Parent informs Company it intends to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including delivering such audited and/or
unaudited financial statements as Parent may request for inclusion in such
filings and using reasonable best efforts to cause Companys
independent auditor to deliver to Parent any related consents.

6.3 _Shareholder Approval_.

(a) Company shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after the date hereof, prepare a proxy statement (or
comparable statement relating to a meeting of shareholders whether or not
proxies are solicited) relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting (the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") that conforms with the requirements of the CBCA and
applicable Law, including the requirements of any federal or state securities
Law, and mail to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Proxy Statement and all other customary proxy or other materials for meetings
such as the Company Shareholders Meeting and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and distribute
to Company shareholders any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if
any event shall occur which requires such action at any time prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent shall cooperate with Company in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy

 



37  Statement, including furnishing Company upon request with any and all
information regarding Parent or its respective affiliates and the plans of
such Persons for the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. The
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Company shall
provide Parent and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements thereto,
prior to disseminating to the shareholders of Company, and Company shall
consider any comments proposed by Parent in good faith. Parent agrees promptly
to notify Company if at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting
any information provided by Parent or its Affiliates in the Proxy Statement,
or any amendment thereto, becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material
respect, and to provide the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or
omission.

(b) Subject to Section 8.1, Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with the CBCA and the Company Articles of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders as promptly as practicable after the distribution of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval
(such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ "), and, except in the case of (i) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.8(f) or (ii) termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, shall solicit, and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, the Requisite Shareholder Approval thereat and shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Company
agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) to convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Company of any Company
Takeover Proposal or by the effecting of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

(c) Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or
postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent required by
applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting or (iii) with the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In
addition, if at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement,
either Company or Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the
Requisite Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, then on a single occasion and prior to the vote
contemplated having been taken, each of Company and Parent shall have the
right to require a single adjournment or postponement of the Company
Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ , that no such adjournments or
postponements shall delay the Company Shareholders Meeting by more than
forty-five (45) days from the originally scheduled date. During any such
period of adjournment or postponement, Company shall continue in all respects
to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.3 and Section 6.8. Except
as set forth in this Section 6.3, Company shall not have any obligation to
postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 



38 (d) During the thirty (30) days following the date hereof, Company may in
its sole discretion, in lieu of the Company Shareholders Meeting and the other
requirements of this Section 6.3, seek and obtain the written consent of the
shareholders of Company representing 100% of the Company Common Stock to
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the CBCA and the Company Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws.

 

6.4 _Public Disclosure_. The parties hereto agree that the initial press
release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a release mutually agreed to by Parent and Company. Thereafter, each of the
parties agrees that no public release, statement or announcement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any
party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
required by applicable Law, or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, or the rules or regulations of
any applicable Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in
which case the party required to make the release, statement or announcement
shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable
time to comment on such release, statement or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

 

6.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall provide each employee of Company and its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time (a " _Covered Employee_ "), for so long as such Covered
Employee remains employed with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Company
and its Subsidiaries) during the period commencing at the Closing and ending
on the first anniversary thereof, with (i) a base salary or base wage that is
no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided by Company and
its Subsidiaries to each such Covered Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less
favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunities (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any commission opportunities) provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (iii) retirement
and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(provided that welfare benefits may be provided under the Company Benefit
Plans in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until Covered
Employees become eligible for the corresponding plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and continued participation in such Company Benefit Plans shall
be deemed to satisfy Parents obligations under this Section 6.5(a)(iii)),
and (iv) the severance benefits set forth on Section 6.5(a)(iv) of the
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will cease to be
a participating employer in BankNote Capital Profit Sharing Pension
Plan-401(k)/Employee Contribution effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Company or its Subsidiaries) following the Closing, Parent shall
cause such employee benefit plan to

 



39  recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit
accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Effective Time under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service, (ii) apply for purposes of any retiree medical plans
or for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or
(iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any health care, dental or vision plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in
which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate, for the plan year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall
(x) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such Parent or Subsidiary plan (excluding any Company Benefit Plan) to
be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) recognize any health care, dental or vision expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date
(or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any Company Benefit Plan).

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Company or any of
their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee.

 

6.6 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Company and Parent agree to cooperate fully with each
other and to use respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at the time and in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Mergers. In
case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger
between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Company Subsidiary, on
the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parents sole expense, take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

 



40 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, amounts paid in
settlement (subject to the prior consent of Parent) or liabilities incurred
in connection with any actions, suits, claims or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the Merger and all transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
would have been permitted under their respective organizational documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement subject to limitations imposed by
applicable Law to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law); _provided_
, the Person to whom such expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
Parent to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
Company or any Subsidiary of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Company (
_provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent
be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 200% of
the annual premiums currently paid by Company (which current amount is set
forth in Section 6.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the "
_Insurance Amount_ "), _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent is unable to
maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the
preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of
the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may, and at Companys request Parent
shall or shall direct Company to, in any case at Parents expense, purchase a
six (6)-year prepaid "tail policy" that provides coverage no less favorable
than the coverage described above; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums for such "tail" policy exceed the Insurance Amount, then Parent may
require Company to obtain a "tail" policy with the maximum coverage available
for the Insurance Amount applied over the term of such policy.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit
of and shall be enforceable by, each present and former director and officer
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs and
representatives.

 



41 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.8, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.1, Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its financial
advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
(collectively with its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, " _Representatives_ ") to: (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Parent) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal and (B) not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other Person any information in connection with or for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (3)
approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter
into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or
agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request (to
the extent it has not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement)
any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in
connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal that remains
in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy all
confidential information of Company or its Affiliates in the possession of
such Person or its Representatives. Company shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under, (1) any standstill provision in
any agreement to which Company or any of its Affiliates is a party or (2) any
confidentiality provision in any agreement to which Company or any of its
Affiliates is a party other than, with respect to this clause (2), any waiver,
amendment, modification or permission under a confidentiality provision that
does not, and would not be reasonably likely to, facilitate,
knowingly encourage or relate in any way to a Company Takeover Proposal or a
potential Company Takeover Proposal. Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
such agreement, and Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
immediately take all steps within their power necessary to terminate any
waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent
or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.8(a),
if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, Company or any of its Representatives,
receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any
Person that did not result from Companys, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives breach of Section 6.8, and if the board of
directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then Company and
its Representatives may, (A)

 



42  furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives; _provided_ , that Company shall concurrently with the
delivery to such Person provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to such Person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided to Parent and (B) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company
Takeover Proposal. Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) notify Parent if Company furnishes non-public information
and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section
6.8(c).

 

(d) Company shall promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day
after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that Company or any of
its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for
information relating to Company or its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely
to lead to or that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such Company
Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in writing,
a description of the terms thereof). Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a current basis, as to the status of (including any developments,
discussions or negotiations) such Company Takeover Proposal (including by
promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt)
providing to Parent copies of any written correspondence, proposals,
indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Company
Takeover Proposal). Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will not enter
into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
which prohibits Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 6.8.

 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.8(f), the board of directors
of Company shall not (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify,
or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of Company,
or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of Company,
a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other
agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with Section 6.8(c)) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_
").

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the preceding
Section 6.8(e), if prior to the time the Requisite Shareholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, in response to the receipt of a bona fide,
unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, the board of directors of Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (i)
the Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.8,
(ii) the Company Takeover 

 



43  Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iii) the failure to approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal, or enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the board of directors of Company may,
subject to compliance with this Section 6.8, effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to so effecting a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (A) Company has given Parent at least
five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain equity, debt or
other financing (the " _Financing_ ") which, together with available cash or
other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, shall, in the aggregate, provide
Parent and its Subsidiaries with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents obligations under this Agreement,
including paying (i) the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the
other amounts payable under Article II and (ii) any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent at the Closing in connection with the Merger
(the " _Required Financing Amount_ "), as promptly as possible but in any
event prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated
pursuant to the terms hereof. Prior to the Closing, Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their employees, agents and
representatives to, provide all cooperation that is reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing. Parent shall give Company prompt notice of any occurrence, event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Financing sufficient for the
satisfaction of the Required Financing Amount.

 



45 (c) The foregoing notwithstanding, and without limiting the effect
of Section 9.7, (i) compliance by Parent with this Section 6.13 shall not
relieve Parent of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available; and (ii) in no
event will the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of
Parents obligations under this Agreement.

6.14 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Parent and Company agree to allocate
and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the Merger
Consideration (and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes) among the assets of the Company in accordance
with the allocation principles set forth on Section 6.14 of the Disclosure
Schedule. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to Company a proposed allocation of the Merger Consideration
(and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes) to Company, determined in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and Section 6.14
of the Disclosure Schedule (" _Parent s Allocation_"). If Company disagrees
with Parents Allocation, Company may, within fifteen (15) days after delivery
of Parents Allocation, deliver a notice (" _Company s Allocation Notice_")
to Parent to such effect, specifying those items as to which Company disagrees
and setting forth Companys proposed allocation. If Companys Allocation
Notice is duly delivered, Company and Parent shall, during the ten (10) days
following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
allocation of the Merger Consideration (and any other items that are treated
as additional consideration for Tax purposes) and, unless Parent and Company
do not agree on an allocation of the Merger Consideration, Parent and Company
agree to file IRS Form 8594 and any other tax filings consistently with such
agreed allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent
and Company do not agree on an allocation of the Merger Consideration (and any
other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes)
among the assets of Company, Parent and Company shall each be entitled to
take any reasonable position with respect thereto, provided that such position
is consistent with Section 6.14 of the Disclosure Schedule.

FORM OF VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This Voting and Support Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 9,
2018, is by and among Triumph Bancorp, Inc., a Texas corporation (" _Parent_
"), First Bancorp of Durango, Inc., a Colorado corporation (" _Company_ "),
and the undersigned shareholders of Company (each a " _Shareholder_ " and
collectively, the " _Shareholders_ ," and together with Company and Parent,
the " _parties_ ").

WHEREAS, the Shareholders are the record and beneficial owners of the number
of shares of common stock, no par value, of Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), set forth on _Annex A_ attached hereto (such shares, together with
any other shares of capital stock of Company the beneficial ownership of
which is acquired by the Shareholders after the date hereof (including through
the exercise of stock options, warrants or similar rights, the conversion or
exchange of securities or the Merger (as defined below) of the power to vote
or direct the voting of such shares) being collectively referred to herein as
the " _Shares_ " of the Shareholders);

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in accordance with its terms, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which Company and Parent have, among other things, agreed to the merger of
Company with and into Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement (the " _Merger_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement and an essential condition to Parent entering into
the Merger Agreement, Company and the Shareholders have agreed to enter into
this Agreement pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and
the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1. _Voting Agreement_. 

 

(a) _Support Agreement_. Each Shareholder, severally and not jointly,
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following a written request from Company (but in no event later
than one business day after any such request), such Shareholder will execute
and deliver to Company a written consent, in the form attached to this
Agreement as _Annex B_ , approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The support
agreements contained herein are coupled, and shall be deemed coupled, with an
interest and may not be modified, rescinded or revoked in any manner that
would render the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement
illegal, impermissible or ultra vires during the term of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, any written consent delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the limitations on effectiveness imposed by Law. (b) _Voting Agreement_. Each Shareholder covenants and agrees that, prior
to the Expiration Date, at any duly called meeting of the shareholders of
Company (or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof), and in any
other circumstances other than a duly called meeting of the shareholders of
Company upon which a vote, consent or other approval (including by written
consent) of the shareholders of Company with respect to the Merger or the
Merger Agreement is sought, such Shareholder shall appear at such meeting, in
person or by proxy, and shall vote, and cause to be voted, all Shares of such
Shareholder: (i) in favor of (A) the approval of the Merger Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (and any actions required in furtherance thereof) and (B) the
approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date
if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (or
any actions required in furtherance thereof), and (ii) against (A) any
proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (B) any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement which would, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
any other obligation or agreement of Company under the Merger Agreement or of
such Shareholder under this Agreement, (C) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, binding share exchange, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, sale of assets or other similar transaction with
or involving Company and any party other than Parent, including any Company
Takeover Proposal, and (D) any other action or proposal the consummation of
which would, or could reasonably be expected to, prevent, impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, discourage or frustrate the purposes of or adversely
affect the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement or the fulfillment of Companys or Parents conditions
under the Merger Agreement. Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be
given) by such Shareholder in accordance with such procedures relating thereto
so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including for purposes of determining
that a quorum is present and for purposes of recording the results of such
vote (or consent). Each Shareholder agrees not to enter into any agreement or
commitment with any Person the effect of which would be inconsistent with or
otherwise violate the provisions and agreements set forth in this Section 1\.
The voting agreements contained herein are coupled, and shall be deemed
coupled, with an interest and may not be modified, rescinded or revoked in any
manner that would render the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger
Agreement illegal, impermissible or _ultra vires_ during the term of this
Agreement.

(c) _Other Voting Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each Shareholder shall remain free to vote or exercise its rights to
consent with respect to the Shares with respect to any matter not covered by
Section 1(b) in any manner such Shareholder deems appropriate, _provided_ ,
that such vote or consent would not and could not reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or frustrate the
purposes, or prevent or delay the consummation, of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the fulfillment of
Companys or Parents conditions under the Merger Agreement.

 

(d) _Additional Shares_. In the event that any Shareholder acquires record
or beneficial ownership of, or the power to vote or direct the voting of, any
additional voting interests with respect to Company, such voting interests
shall, without further action of the parties, be subject to the provisions of
this Agreement and the number of Shares shall be deemed to have been adjusted
accordingly.

 



-2- (e) _Termination_. The obligations set forth in this Section 1 shall
terminate immediately upon the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

 

2. _Restrictions on Transfer_. Each Shareholder covenants and agrees, in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company only, that prior to the Expiration Date, such Shareholder shall not, and shall cause each controlled Affiliate of such Shareholder (other than Company) not to, directly or indirectly (other than pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by to the Merger Agreement), (i) give, offer, sell, exchange, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, hedge or otherwise dispose of the record or beneficial ownership (or enter into any other transaction that has similar economic effect to the foregoing) (any such act, a " _Transfer_ ") of, or enter into any contract, option or other legally binding arrangement for the Transfer of, or consent to any Transfer of, any or all of such Shareholders (or such Shareholders controlled Affiliates) Shares, or any right, title or interest therein, or seek to do any of the foregoing, other than in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) grant any proxies or enter into any voting trust, voting agreement, power of attorney or other agreement or legally binding arrangement with respect to any such Shares or deposit any of such Shares into a voting trust, or (iii) otherwise permit any Liens to be created on any such Shares; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) Transfers by will or operation of Law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee or (b) Transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes to relatives, trusts, other entities controlled by the Shareholder and charitable organizations, subject to each transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. No Transfer of any Shares in violation of this Section 2 shall be made or recorded on the books of Company and any such attempted Transfer shall be void and of no effect. Each Shareholder shall promptly notify Parent if such Shareholder is approached or solicited, directly or indirectly, in respect of any Transfer of Shares, and shall provide Parent with all details relating thereto as reasonably requested by Parent. Furthermore, Shareholder covenants and agrees not to take any action that would cause any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "takeover," "interested shareholder" or other similar Law to apply to the Shares. 

 

3. _Confidentiality_. Each Shareholder recognizes that successful consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) may be dependent upon confidentiality with respect to the matters referred to herein. In this connection, prior to the public disclosure thereof by Company or Parent pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each Shareholder hereby agrees, in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company only, to keep confidential and not to issue any press release or make any other public statement without the prior written consent of Company and Parent, except as required by applicable Law. 

4. _Nonsolicitation_. Prior to the Expiration Date, each Shareholder (solely in its capacity as a shareholder of Company) shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its agents, advisors and other representatives (" _Representatives_ ") not to, (a) solicit, initiate, induce, encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the making of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or which could result in, a Company Takeover Proposal (" _Alternative Inquiry_ "), (b) other than with Parent or Parents

Alternative Inquiry, (c) approve, accept, endorse or recommend any Company
Takeover Proposal or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement a Company Takeover Proposal or Alternative Inquiry, or (d) enter
into any agreement with respect to or resolve or agree to any of the actions

Agreement, each Shareholder (solely in its capacity as a shareholder of
Company) shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal or Alternative Inquiry.

5. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder_. Each Shareholder, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to Parent that: 

 

(a) _Ownership of Shares_. Such Shareholder beneficially owns (as such
term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) and (except with respect
to shares held in street name) owns of record all of the Shares listed on
_Annex A_ attached hereto as owned by such Shareholder as of the date
hereof, free and clear of all Liens, proxies and restrictions on the right to
vote or Transfer such Shares, except for any such Liens and restrictions
arising hereunder and except for Transfer restrictions of general
applicability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and state "blue
sky" laws. Without limiting the foregoing, except to the extent set forth in
this Agreement, such Shareholder has the sole power, authority and legal
capacity to vote and Transfer such Shareholders Shares listed on _Annex A_
attached hereto and no Person other than such Shareholder has any right to

options, warrants or other rights to acquire any additional shares of Company
Common Stock or any securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of
Company Common Stock.

relief and other equitable remedies. If this Agreement is being executed in a
representative or fiduciary capacity, the Person signing this Agreement has
full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement.

 

(c) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such

a loss of benefits, or result in the creation of a Lien on any asset of such
Shareholder pursuant to, any agreement, instrument or indenture to which such
Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder is bound, except in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences of the type referred to above which
