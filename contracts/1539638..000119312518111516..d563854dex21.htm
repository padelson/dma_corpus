agree to allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the Merger Consideration (and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) among the assets of the Company in accordance with the
allocation principles set forth on Section&nbsp;6.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. No later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Company a proposed allocation of the Merger Consideration (and any other items
that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) to Company, determined in a manner consistent with Section&nbsp;1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and Section&nbsp;6.14 of the Disclosure Schedule
(&#147;<U>Parent&#146;s Allocation</U>&#148;). If Company disagrees with Parent&#146;s Allocation, Company may, within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after delivery of Parent&#146;s Allocation, deliver a notice (&#147;<U>Company&#146;s Allocation
Notice</U>&#148;) to Parent to such effect, specifying those items as to which Company disagrees and setting forth Company&#146;s proposed allocation. If Company&#146;s Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Company and Parent shall, during the ten

consideration for Tax purposes) and, unless Parent and Company do not agree on an allocation of the Merger Consideration, Parent and Company agree to file IRS Form 8594 and any other tax filings consistently with such agreed allocation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent and Company do not agree on an allocation of the Merger Consideration (and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes) among the assets of Company, Parent and
Company shall each be entitled to take any reasonable position with respect thereto, provided that such position is consistent with Section&nbsp;6.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. </P>
