vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 23, 2006 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, a New York
corporation (" _Parent_ "), AEGIS ACQUISITION CORP, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and INTERNET SECURITY
SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub deems it in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the
" _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have
approved this Agreement and declared its advisability (and, in the case of the
Board of Directors of the Company, recommended that this Agreement be adopted
by the Companys stockholders);

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company are executing and delivering offer letters (the "
_Offer Letters_ ") regarding the employment of such employees following the
consummation of the Merger; and

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders and employees of the Company are entering into agreements with
Parent pursuant to which such stockholders and employees shall agree, among
other things, to certain non-competition, non-solicitation and no hire
restrictions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing), at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in
Article VI shall not have been satisfied or waived on such second business
day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on which all
such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_
".

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ")
shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto
and, as so amended, the Company Certificate shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06.  _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



 

2 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

_Conversion of Securities_

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock
of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), (ii) except
as provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares and (iii) Restricted
Shares to the extent set forth in Section 5.04) shall be converted into the
right to receive $28.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such
withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.02(f) and any applicable
tax Law.

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder



 

3 who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and,
from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent
funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it
being understood that any and all interest or other amounts earned with
respect to funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
a form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify and which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the



 

4 Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to
the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon
the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash that would otherwise have been
payable in respect of any Certificate which is properly delivered to a public
official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving



 

5 Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or
destroyed Certificate.

(f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.

(g) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the 18-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with

desirable, other than where the failure to be so organized, existing,
qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the case of clause (i)

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made

maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
other person that, together with the Company, is treated as a single employer

forth a complete and correct list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

26 (iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits
(each, a " _Welfare Plan_ ") is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code). There are no
understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would
prevent any Welfare Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or
other former employees) from being amended or terminated without material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or at any time after
the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan provides benefits after termination of
employment, except where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former

with any other event) or any compensation or benefits related to or contingent
upon, or the value of which will be calculated on the basis of, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event). The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event)
and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement do not and
will not (A) trigger any funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of,
or increase the cost of, or give rise to any other obligation under, any
Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or any other employment arrangement, (B)
trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any Company Personnel to the
Company or any of its affiliates or (C) result in any

normal operation of the Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or
involving any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement or asserting any rights or
claims to benefits under, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

(viii) All material contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
connection with the Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements that are required to
have been made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely made
or accrued. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, or
is reasonably likely to incur, any unfunded liabilities in relation to
any Benefit Plan that have not been properly accounted for under GAAP.

(ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors or employees or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of any Benefit Plan
or trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not an officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Non-Affiliate Plan
Fiduciary_ "), has engaged that is reasonably likely to subject the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate
Plan Fiduciary, to a material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of
ERISA or any other applicable Law and (B) none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or employees, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary, or any

manner, or failed to act in a manner, that is reasonably likely to subject the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to any material liability for breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law.



 

28 (x) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any material liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(n) _Taxes._ (i) Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each Company
Affiliated Group has timely filed all material tax returns required to be
filed by it, and all such tax returns are complete and correct in all material
respects. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each Company
Affiliated Group has timely paid all material taxes due and owing other than
taxes being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves, in
accordance with GAAP, have been established. The most recent financial
statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve,
in accordance with GAAP, for all material taxes payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements.

41 The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the compliance
by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not and will not
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to
a loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in
or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, or give rise
to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements
under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
Parent or Sub, (ii) any Contract or Permit to which Parent or Sub is a party
or bound by or their respective properties or assets are bound by or subject
to or otherwise under which Parent or Sub has rights or benefits or (iii)
subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the
following sentence, any Law or Judgment, in each case, applicable to Parent
or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancelations, accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or
entitlements that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation
by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this
Agreement, except for (A) the filing of a premerger notification and report
form under the HSR Act and the filings and receipt, termination
or expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting periods
required under any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or
similar Law, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
qualified to do business and (C) such other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and notices, the failure
of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to impair in any material respect the ability of each of
Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will (except to the extent revised or superseded by



 

42 amendments or supplements contemplated thereby), at the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders, at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as
amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(d) _Ownership and Interim Operations of Sub._ Parent owns beneficially and of
record all of the outstanding capital stock of Sub. Sub was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _Capital Resources._ Parent and Sub collectively have, and will have
access at the Effective Time and from time to time thereafter as required by
this Agreement to, sufficient cash resources available to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration and the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to Section
5.04 and to pay all fees and expenses payable by each of them in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to perform their
respective obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(f) _Section 203 of DGCL._ Neither Parent nor Sub (or any of their respective
"affiliates" or "associates") is or has been an "interested stockholder" (as
defined in Section 203 of DGCL) with respect to the Company within the last
three years.

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this

its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly (and it shall instruct and
cause each applicable Subsidiary, if any, to instruct each such director,
officer, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to), (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action knowingly
to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative
thereof) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with any person (or any representative thereof) with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written unsolicited
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and which Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 4.02
or Section 4.01(a)(viii)(C), the Company may, and may permit and authorize
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries representatives to, in each
case subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement which contains terms that are no less restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 4, 2006, between
Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), provided that all such information had been
provided, or is concurrently provided, to Parent, and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
4.02(a) by the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub or any
affiliate of Parent or Sub) relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead
to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer,
exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding



 

49 share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar transaction, of (i)
assets or businesses that constitute or generate 15% or more of the total
revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the
aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses referred to
in clause (i) above.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
binding bona fide unsolicited written offer, which did not result from a
breach of Section 4.02(a), made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any
affiliate of Parent or Sub) that, if consummated, would result in such person
(or in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the
stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which
offer, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel), (i) is more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Merger (taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including the ability of the parties thereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby and any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend, or propose
publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal, or
resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action, resolution or
agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change"_ ), (ii) adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal, or
propose the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree
to take any such action, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended
to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or agree
to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in
response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, _provided_  



 

50 that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board
of Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first provided prior
written notice to Parent (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that
it is prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, which notice shall, in the case of
a Superior Proposal, attach the most current version of any written agreement
or proposal relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior
Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event, attach information
describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and (B) Parent does
not make, within five business days after the receipt of such notice, a
proposal that would, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of
national reputation and outside legal counsel), (x) cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal or (y) obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of an Intervening Event. The Company agrees that, during the five
business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its officers, directors, and
representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

For purposes of this Agreement the term " _Intervening Event_ " means an
event, unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (or, if known, the material consequences of which are not known to
or understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as of this Agreement),
which event (or any material consequence of which) becomes known to or by (or
understood by) the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Stockholder
Approval and which causes the Board of Directors of the Company to conclude
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that its failure to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt,
existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections
4.02(a) and 4.02(b), the Company shall, as promptly as possible and in any
event within 24 hours after the Company first obtains knowledge of the receipt
thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or
any request for information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes
could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any
subsequent amendment or other modification



 

51 to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, once, and not more than once, each day at mutually
reasonably agreeable times, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A)
advise and confer with Parent (or its outside counsel) regarding the progress
of negotiations concerning any Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and
unresolved issues related thereto and the material terms (including material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of
any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon receipt
or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of
all documents and written communications relating to any such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry exchanged between the Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives, on the one hand, and the person making a
Takeover Proposal or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the
other hand.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company,
failure so to disclose is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its
Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any
action prohibited by Section 4.02(b)(i), (ii) or (iii), except as expressly
permitted by Section 4.02(b).

SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the
Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action that is reasonably likely to result in (a) any representation
and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as
to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such
representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material respect.

Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent
an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including
the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include
in such document or response all comments promptly and reasonably proposed by
Parent, and (iii) unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
made an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall not file or mail such document,
or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and in any event
approval will be provided within two business days following a request
therefor. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other
parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of
the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement
will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements
contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made in the Proxy



 

53 Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent
for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein. Parent agrees that none
of such information will (except to the extent revised or superseded by
amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company
or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company
shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such
action, cause to occur no later than the 20th business day immediately
following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company
determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other
Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) the Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and
only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is
required by applicable Law to comply with comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have delivered an Adverse Recommendation Change Notice to
Parent, the Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting until one day after the
expiration of the five-business day period immediately following delivery of
such notice. The notice of such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a
resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders
Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company
shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Stock that they adopt this
Agreement, and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal.

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._  (a) Subject to
applicable Law or Judgment, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and
other representatives and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective
properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents,
information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall



 

54 cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent any information
concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work
papers of Ernst and Young LLP) subject to the requirements of Ernst and Young LLP)
and (ii) following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent may (but shall not be required to), following reasonable notice to the
Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; provided that Parent and its representatives shall coordinate any
such activities with the Company with a view towards not unreasonably
interfering with the business or operations of the Company. No investigation
by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other
receipt of information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other provision
in this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment,
Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any
and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement and will comply with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent requested
by Parent, provide Parent with (i) a complete and correct list of all licenses
issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ ") and held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _FCC Licenses_ "), (ii)
complete and correct copies of each FCC License, which FCC Licenses contain:
(A) the address and physical location of the device(s) covered by each FCC
License, and (B) a written description of the purpose of the device(s)
covered by each FCC License, (iii) complete and correct copies of any Notices
of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) all information reasonably necessary for
Parent to make an independent determination that the Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership
control of the FCC Licenses (including descriptions of any transactions that
effected a change of ownership or control of the FCC Licenses (including any
intracompany reorganizations) and corporate organizational charts depicting
the ownership structure of the holder of the FCC Licenses before and after
any such change of ownership or control).

(c) The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate to ensure an orderly
transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries.



 

55 SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to

and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving
of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other persons and the
making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
filings under the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings
with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all
reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information requested by
a Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with officials of
such entity in the course of its review of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other person and (v)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from any third
parties; provided, that this clause (v) shall not limit the rights of the
Company or its Board of Directors under Section 4.02(b). In connection with
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and
its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not without the prior written consent of Parent, agree or
proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
any portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any suit, claim,
action, investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative,
brought by any Governmental Entity (i) challenging or seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries any damages in relation therewith; (ii) seeking to prohibit
or limit in any respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or
operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of all
or any portion of the business or assets or any product of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries or to require any such person to
dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive
license) or hold separate all or any portion of the business or assets or any
product of the Company or its



 

56 Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iii) seeking to directly or indirectly impose limitations on
the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise
full rights of ownership of, any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, including the right to vote the
Company Common Stock or the shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, respectively; or (iv) seeking to
(A) directly or indirectly prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates from
effectively controlling in any respect any of the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) directly or indirectly prevent the
Company or its Subsidiaries from operating any of their business in
substantially the same manner as operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each other as is
reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations and, in connection therewith, shall
notify the other person promptly following the receipt of any comments from
any Governmental Entity and of any request by any Governmental Entity for
amendments, supplements or additional information in respect of any
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such Governmental
Entity and shall supply the other person with copies of all correspondence
between such person or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand.

(b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good
faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material,
individually or in the aggregate, operational developments, the general status
of relationships with customers and resellers, the general status of ongoing
operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to
procedures reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of:

(A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that is reasonably
likely to be, material, in an adverse manner, to the business, assets,
properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) has resulted, or is reasonably
likely to result, in (I) any representation and warranty of the Company set
forth in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition
set forth in Section 6.02(a) would not be satisfied or (II) any other
condition to the transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section
6.02 not being satisfied;



 

57 (B) the failure of the Company to perform any obligation to be performed by it
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b)
would not be satisfied;

(C) any material notice or other material communication from any person
(other than a Governmental Entity) reasonably alleging that the consent of
such person is required in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(D) any notice or other communication from any Major Customer or Major
Supplier to the effect that such Major Customer or Major Supplier is
terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying its relationship with
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(E) any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and a copy of any such notice or communication (if in
written form) shall be promptly furnished to Parent; and

(F) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or that relate to the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of
the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(iii) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (A) any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section
6.03(a) would not be satisfied, (B) the failure of Parent or Sub to perform
any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.



 

58 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior written
consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim (which
consent shall, solely in the case of any Material Litigation that has resulted
in any condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) not being satisfied, not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that no litigation shall be
considered Material Litigation for purposes of this Section 5.03 if Parent
shall have waived any condition to Closing to the extent such condition is not
satisfied as a result of such litigation as of the date that all other
conditions to closing shall have been satisfied or waived by Parent);
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 5.03(c) shall obligate Parent to agree
or consent to the Company or any Subsidiary divesting, holding separate,
or entering into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, any
assets (whether tangible or intangible); and _provided_ further that it is
understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(c) shall not give Parent the
right to direct such defense.

SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including
obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the following:

(i) at the Effective Time, each Vested Employee Stock Option other than a
Rolled-Over Stock Option or an Affected Stock Option shall be canceled and
each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Vested Employee Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Employee Stock Option, which amount shall be payable
to such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time;

(ii) at the Effective Time, each Non-Employee Stock Option shall be canceled
and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancelation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Non-Employee Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Non-Employee Stock Option, which amount shall be payable to
such holder at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time;



 

59 (iii) Subject to the Offer Letters, each Rolled-Over Stock Option shall be
converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Rolled-Over Stock Option (other

exercise price by tendering previously owned shares of Company Common Stock),
the number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share ("
_Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share), determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Rolled-Over Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Rolled-Over Stock
Option divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio (each Rolled-Over Stock Option
as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ ");

(iv) each Affected Stock Option shall be terminated prior to the Effective
Time (other than Affected Stock Options under the 1995 Plan, which shall
terminate immediately after the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the
1995 Plan) by (A) providing timely notice (to allow for the termination of
such Affected Stock Options prior to the Effective Time) to holders of
Affected Stock Options that neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall
assume such Affected Stock Options or substitute options for such Affected
Stock Options and (B) permitting holders of such Affected Stock Options to
exercise such Affected Stock Options during the applicable exercise period
specified by the applicable Company Stock Plan (which, in each case, shall
expire on the date that is no later than one day prior to the
Effective Time);

for the issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company Common Stock or
any Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Units or any other interests in
respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock
appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted prior to the Effective
Time, and the Company shall ensure prior to the Effective Time that, following
the Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock, Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Units or any other
interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) of the Company or the Surviving Corporation; and
(B) on the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the normal distribution
date in the ordinary course, all Company Common Stock, Stock Options,
Restricted Shares, Stock Units or any other interests in respect of any
capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) required to be granted under the Company 2006 Sales Performance
Equity Plan with respect to the third quarter of 2006 shall be delivered to
the participants therein.



 

60 (vi) Subject to the Offer Letters, each Employee Restricted Share outstanding
at the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration (each Employee
Restricted Share as so converted, a " _Restricted Share Cash Amount_ "),
the payments of which shall be subject to, and shall be made to the holder of
such Employee Restricted Share (each, an " _RS Holder_ ") in accordance with,
Section 5.04(c) hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that Restricted
Shares granted under the 1995 Plan that are held by RS Holders who have not
executed Offer Letters or otherwise consented to the foregoing treatment prior

to Section 5.04(a)(vii) and not subject to this Section 5.04(a)(vi) or
Section 5.04(c);

(vii) Each Cash-Out Restricted Share outstanding at the Effective Time shall
be adjusted as necessary to provide that the restrictions on such share shall
lapse at the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time, such Cash-Out
Restricted Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(c), subject to any applicable
withholding pursuant to Section 2.02(f), which amount shall be payable to the
holder of such Cash-Out Restricted Share at or as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time;

(viii) Subject to the Offer Letters, each Employee Stock Unit shall be
converted at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit, subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Employee Stock Unit
(other than with respect to performance-based vesting), with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number
of Company Common Stock subject to such Employee Stock Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) (each Employee Stock Unit so adjusted, an " _Adjusted
RSU_");

(ix) each Non-Employee Restricted Share outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount
of cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be payable to
the holder of such Non-Employee Restricted Share at or as soon as practicable

(x) each Non-Employee Stock Unit outstanding at the Effective Time shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall then become
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which
amount shall be payable to such holder at or as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time; and

(xi) except as expressly required pursuant to this Section 5.04, take such
action as necessary under the Company Stock Plans to ensure that all
restrictions



 

61 or limitations on transfer and vesting, all forfeiture restrictions and all
repurchase rights with respect to the Employee Restricted Shares (in each
case to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have
already lapsed), and all other terms thereof (other than with respect to
performance-based vesting), shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to the corresponding Restricted Share Cash Amount after giving effect
to the Merger, subject to the terms of the grant of such Employee Restricted
Shares as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

its affiliates on a Lapse Date (other than any termination of employment that
results in the occurrence of a Lapse Date pursuant to such terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Restricted Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time), such RS Holder shall not be entitled to receive the
Applicable RS Portion for such Lapse Date and any subsequent Lapse Date. For
purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Applicable RS Portion_ " means, in respect
of each such RS Holder, an amount equal to the product of the Merger

statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) is currently effective.
Any such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be
maintained) as long as any Adjusted Option may remain outstanding.

(f) The adjustments provided in Section 5.04(a) with respect to any Stock
Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the

$753,000); _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the
Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 300% amount. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 5.05(c) shall require Parent to make
expenditures exceeding $2,259,000 in the aggregate.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05(i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.05 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any indemnified
party to whom this Section 5.05 applies unless (i) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected
indemnified party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification.

SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.



 

64 (b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly made known to
the Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders or any
person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and
whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal
otherwise becomes widely known to the stockholders of the Company and
thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (B) prior to the
date that is 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or any Takeover Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes
of this Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have
the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in
Section 4.02(a) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references
to 40%) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(c), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$37,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds to
an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such termination
and (B) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in
Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the first to occur of such events.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 5.06 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 5.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06 at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
Parent and Sub acknowledge that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the fee referred to in this Section 5.06 on more than one occasion.

SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent
and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the
extent at all reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making,
and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the Company may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press,



 

65 analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially
similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually, if made in compliance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.07). For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event a Takeover Proposal that is not a Superior Proposal is
made, then, as and to the extent required by its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall in no way be limited in communicating to the stockholders
of the Company the reasons it did not withdraw its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger as a result of such Takeover Proposal, and such
communications shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

SECTION 5.08. _Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of
Subs obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 5.09. _Company Rights Agreement._ The Board of Directors of the
Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in
Section 3.01(s)) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, amend, modify, take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Company Rights Agreement.

SECTION 5.10. _Certain Pre-Closing Actions._ Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all actions set forth on Section 5.10 of the Company
Letter.

Article VIII and except for any material breach by a party that is willful

their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 8.09.  _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ Each of

Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees that no
such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by
it or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties
further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such persons respective address set forth above shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth
above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable,
in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.



 

75 SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed
and delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party
to do so.

SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the
