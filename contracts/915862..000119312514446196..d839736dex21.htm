iii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 18, 2014 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among COUCHE-TARD U.S. INC., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), CT-US ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a direct
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and THE PANTRY, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company under the Laws of Delaware (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
surviving the Merger and becoming a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent as a
result of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously has (i) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, to enter into this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger and continue as a Delaware
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") as a result of the Merger.

Section 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1_, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place on the date that is the second Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to  applicable Law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth
in _Article VIII_ unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto (the date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh
Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto.

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger executed
in accordance with, and in such form as required by, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), substantially in the form of
_Exhibit A_ hereto. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time as is
agreed by the parties hereto prior to the Closing Date and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided for in the DGCL. Under the DGCL, from and
after the Effective Time: (a) the Merger of the Company and Merger Sub and
their continuance as one company shall become effective; (b) the property of
each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the property of the Surviving
Corporation; (c) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be liable for the
obligations and liabilities of each of the Company and Merger Sub; (d) any
existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution shall be
unaffected; (e) a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding
pending by or against the Company or Merger Sub may be continued to be
prosecuted by or against the Surviving Corporation; and (f) a conviction
against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, the Company or
Merger Sub may be enforced by or against the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.6. _Directors; Officers_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
officers of the

 



\- 2 -  Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.7. _Effect on Share Capital_. Pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Dissenting Shares or shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.7(f)_)
shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right
to receive $36.75 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares or shares referred to in _Section 1.7(f)_) shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without
interest.

(c)  _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
has properly exercised and perfected its, his or her appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor
provision) (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served 

 



\- 3 -  pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate, at its expense,
in negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any
material payment or agree to make any material payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

(e) _Changes to Company Stock_. If prior to the Effective Time, the Company
should split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in Company Common Stock, or
otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any other securities, or make
any other such stock dividend in respect of the Company Common Stock, then
the Merger Consideration and any other number or amount contained herein that
is based upon the price of Company Common Stock or the number of shares of
Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

(f) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct or
indirect Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist.

 

Section 1.8. _Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock
Units_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that was granted pursuant to any of
the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the Companys 2007
Omnibus Plan, as amended (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "),
whether vested or unvested (each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent not already vested) and be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Options the
cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Tax with respect to the
making of such payment, within three calendar days following the Effective
Time. If the applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled without payment of additional consideration, and all rights with
respect to such Company Option shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 



\- 4 - (b) Each award of Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other
lapse restrictions pursuant to any of the Company Stock Plans that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested (each, a " _Company Restricted Share Award_ "), shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested (without regard to the satisfaction of
any performance condition, vesting or other lapse restriction) and be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share Award (which for each
Company Restricted Share Award that is subject to performance-based vesting
and for which the performance period is incomplete as of the Effective Time,
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award shall be
determined pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 1.8(b)_) by (ii)
the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Restricted
Share Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence,
less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Tax with respect
to the making of such payment, within three calendar days following the
Effective Time. For each Company Restricted Share Award that is subject to
performance-based vesting and for which the performance period is incomplete
as of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock, for
purposes of subclause (i) above, shall be determined based on the greater
of (x) the target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Share Award and (y) actual performance achieved during the
twelve (12) month period ending on the last day of the fiscal month most
recently completed on or prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Each award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to any of the
Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ "), shall as
of the Effective Time, become fully vested (without regard to the satisfaction
of any performance condition, vesting or other lapse condition) and be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company RSU Awards the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Law relating to Tax with respect to the making of such
payment, within three calendar days following the Effective Time.

ARTICLE II.

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1. _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with an experienced bank or trust company as Parent shall determine
and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with  _Section 1.7_, immediately available
funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and Parent shall

 



\- 5 -  instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration subject
to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.2_ of this Agreement. Any
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_." Such aggregate cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated
the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services, (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion or (v) any registered open end investment company holding itself
out as a "money market fund" or whose investments are otherwise restricted
principally to the instruments described in subclauses (i) through (iv)
above.

Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Exchange Agent will send to each record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock other than Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
a reasonable and customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, and the Certificate and Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ or _Section 1.8_. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have established
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

Section 2.3. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



\- 6 - Section 2.4. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) for the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable abandoned property, escheat, or other similar
Laws, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.5. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

Section 2.6. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate or other documentation (including an indemnity in
customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

 

Section 2.7. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, any holder of Company Options and any holder of Company
Restricted Share Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

Section 2.8. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do any other actions and things in each case to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

 



\- 7 - Section 2.9. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business, New York time,
on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall

Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

ARTICLE VI. 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Section 6.1. _Conduct of the Business Before the Closing Date_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give to the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of Parent or its
Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date or at any other time.

 

Section 6.2. _Indemnification Continuation_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 6.2_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective
Time, (x) an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiary or (y)
serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to
provide indemnification to each Indemnified Person to the same extent and
under the same conditions and procedures as such Indemnified Person is
entitled on the date hereof under the Company Organizational Documents (or
the corresponding organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiary) and
as provided in employment or indemnification agreements with such Indemnified
Person as in effect on the date hereof in connection with any Proceeding based
directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or arising directly or
indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that such Indemnified Person
is or was an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiary, or is or
was serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of
another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of
any partnership or a trustee of any trust, to the extent pertaining to any and
all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving Corporation shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses provisions of the Company

 



\- 29 -  Organizational Documents or the corresponding organizational documents of
the Companys Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification contracts of the Company or its Subsidiary with any
of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in each case in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time
were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiary.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same
coverage containing terms, conditions and exclusions that are not less
favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but
for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than 300% of current annual
premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of current
annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officers and directors
liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person. If such "tail"
policy has been established by the Company, Parent shall not terminate such
policy and shall cause all of the Companys obligations thereunder to be
honored by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.2_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit
each of the Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim
or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

(e) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together with
its successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable requirements under Law, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer
or director of the Company and its Subsidiary against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by
such Indemnified Person as an officer or director of the Company in
connection with any pending or threatened Proceeding based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company and its Subsidiary at or prior to the
Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under
any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Parties will not be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting
the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date
on

 



\- 30 -  which the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable requirements under Law, advance
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which
such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(e)_ with reasonable promptness after receipt by Parent of a
written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified
Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to
repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a
final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section
6.2(e)_.

 

(f) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.2_.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.2_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.
Unless required by the applicable requirement under Law, this _Section 6.2_
may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any
of their heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Person.

Section 6.3. _Notice of Breach_. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, Parent shall promptly give notice to the
Company upon (a) having Knowledge of any breach by Parent of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein that would be likely
to cause the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.3(a)_ and _8.3(b)_ not to be
satisfied; (b) written receipt of notice from any third party alleging that
the consent of such third party is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the failure to obtain such
consent would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or (c) the existence of any event or circumstance that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or would be reasonably likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party hereto to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied.

fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other
in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself and Merger Sub and their respective officers,
directors, Affiliates and agents that is required to be included in the Proxy

reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC
as promptly as practicable and thereafter mailed to the Companys stockholders
as promptly as practicable.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any written request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and each shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the other(s) with copies of all correspondence between

the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall (i) cause the Proxy Statement to comply
as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable thereto, (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, with the assistance of, and after
consultation with, Parent, as provided by this _Section 7.1(b)_, as promptly
as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy

SEC comments with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement. If, at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement or
the other filings shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties thereof, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Prior to the filing or mailing of the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any SEC
comments on the Proxy Statement, each of the Company and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall (i)
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements to the foregoing
documents and (ii) consider in good faith such comments reasonably proposed
by the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, as applicable.

 



\- 32 - (c) The Company shall, on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement,
take all action necessary to establish a record date for, call, give notice
of, and hold, the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the Required Company Vote and conducting any advisory vote required under
Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act. In connection with such meeting, the
Company will, subject to _Section 7.4(b)_ and _Section 7.4(c)_, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Company Vote, including
soliciting from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. The Company shall keep
Parent and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested Parent or Merger Sub. The information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement,
shall not, on the date(s) the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company may not
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting without consulting with
Parent except (A) to the extent necessary under applicable Law to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) in order to obtain a quorum of
stockholders, if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the
Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

Section 7.2. _Access to Information_. During the period from the date hereof
to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms and the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, upon reasonable
advance notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities at its expense and in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided further_ , however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the protection
of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the Company to risk of liability
for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access
or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice
to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, contract or
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Each party hereto

 



\- 33 -  will hold any such information that is nonpublic in confidence to the extent

penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any contract or agreement.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly, but in
no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, file any

or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all further action as may
be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, state
antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other
nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any
Law (other than with respect to any stockholder litigation or claim related
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) with

 



\- 34 -  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
Termination Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its

Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets

_Divestiture Actions_ "), in each case as may be required in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; _provided_
that neither the Company nor its Subsidiary shall become subject to, or
consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Entity to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company only in the event
that the Closing occurs. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) take or agree to take any action that
would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the

Entity with respect to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating

Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or

submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiary, or proposals from third
parties with respect thereto, (y) as necessary or appropriate to address
reasonable privilege concerns or reasonable confidentiality concerns relating
to proprietary or commercially sensitive information regarding Parent and its
operations. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to
participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with any material matter relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent

 



\- 35 -  permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 7.3_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or
restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.3_ or
anything else herein to the contrary, Parent shall have the sole right
(subject to compliance with its obligations under this _Section 7.3_) to
determine, direct and have full control over the strategy and process by which
the parties will seek required approvals under the HSR Act and any
other antitrust Laws and to control the defense or prosecution of any claims,
actions or proceedings relating thereto, including all matters relating to any
Divestiture Actions.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall limit a partys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_ so long as
such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this _Section 7.3_.
