AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and effective as of August 24, 2005 among JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC., a Wisconsin corporation (" _Parent_ "), YJC ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and YORK INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Company_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to enter into a transaction whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $.005 per share, of Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned directly or indirectly by Company will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; and 

   

 WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with, and to prescribe certain conditions to, the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 

  

THE MERGER

   

Section 1.1. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate. 

  

Section 1.2. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
occur at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the first Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_, other
than conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, or such
other time and date as Parent and Company shall agree in writing, unless this
Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms (the actual
time and date of the Closing is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ "). The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Foley and Lardner LLP, 777 East
Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 or such other place as Parent and
Company shall agree in writing. 

  

Section 1.3. _Effective Time._ At the Closing, the parties hereto shall (a)
file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such 

  ##### 

  

   

form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and (b) make all other filings or recordings required
by the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and
time that the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ "). 

  

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. 

  

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation._ The Certificate of Incorporation
of Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended to reflect only the provisions set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, and the Certificate of Incorporation of Company,
as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

Section 1.6. _By-Laws._ The Amended and Restated By-Laws of Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law. 

  

Section 1.7. _Officers and Directors._ The officers of Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

Section 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_ and Dissenting Shares as provided in _Section 2.10_) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $56.50, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

  

 (b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. 

  

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly or indirectly by Company at the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, 

   ##### 

  

    

fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

Section 1.9. _Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards._  

   

 (a) All awards granting restricted shares of Company Common Stock from Company that have not vested (collectively, " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") heretofore granted under any Company Stock Plan shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, become fully vested and without further restrictions with respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all Company Restricted Shares to become shares of Company Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.8(a)_. 

  

 (b) Each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Company Restricted Stock, Company Stock Options or rights to acquire SPP Shares (collectively, " _Company Stock-Based Awards_ "), heretofore granted under any Company Stock Plan shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, become fully vested and without further restrictions with respect to ownership rights thereto, and each Company Stock-Based Award shall be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which such Company Stock-Based Award relates. 

  

 (c) All outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock from Company other than SPP Shares (collectively, " _Company Stock Options)_ heretofore granted under any Company Stock Plan, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall cease to represent, as of the Effective Time, a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, in settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to receive, at the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the per share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. 

  

 (d) The Company Stock Plans, including the portion of the Employee Benefit Plans described in  _Section 1.9(b)_ that provide for the grant of Company Stock-Based Awards, shall terminate, and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital stock or other equity interests of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for the issuance or grant of any right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), shall be canceled, effective as of the Effective Time, without any liability on the part of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement). 

  

 (e) No Person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans, including the Employee Benefit Plans described in _Section 1.9(b)_, or under any other plan, program, 

   ##### 

  

    

agreement or arrangement with respect to equity interests of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or for the issuance or grant of any right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive benefits measured by the value of a number
of shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted stock units,
deferred stock units and dividend equivalents, at and after the Effective
Time (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 1.9_ or
_Article 2_). 

  

 (f) Subject to any deferral election with respect to Company Stock-Based Awards then in effect, reasonably promptly, and in no event later than 48 hours, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards that consents to the treatment that this _Section 1.9_ contemplates in respect of all of such holders Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards the cash payments specified in this _Section 1.9_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payments contemplated by this _Section 1.9_, _provided_ that the cash proceeds payable with respect to any Company-Stock Based Awards subject to deferral elections shall be deemed invested for the applicable deferral period in hypothetical investments selected by the holders of such Company Stock-Based Awards, which shall be those offered to similarly situated employees of Parent under Parents Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. To the extent the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required or entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (collectively, the " _Code_ "), or any provision of any other Tax Law, the amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 (g) At the Effective Time, the Companys 1992 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Stock Purchase Plan_ ") shall terminate. In connection with such termination, the Exercise Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan) shall be deemed to be the date that is one day prior to the Effective Time, as a result of which each participant therein shall be entitled to receive prior to the Effective Time a number of whole and fractional shares of Company Common Stock calculated pursuant to Section 7 of the Stock Purchase Plan (the " _SPP Shares_ ") and Company shall retain accumulated payroll deductions, thereby causing all such SPP Shares to become shares of Company Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.8(a)_.

ARTICLE 2 

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

   

Section 2.1. _Paying Agent._ As of the Effective Time, Parent shall designate,
and enter into an agreement with, such bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), which agreement shall provide that Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient to effect the payment of the
Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section
1.8(a)_ and this _Article 2_. 

  

Section 2.2. _Payment Procedures._ Promptly, but in no event later than 48
hours, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock that
were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 1.8(a)_ (the " _Certificates_ ") (a) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (b) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as Parent may appoint, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed, and such other documents as the
Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, then it shall be a
condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration that (i) the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have (A)
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered
or (B) established to the satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes either
have been paid or are not payable. 

  

Section 2.3. _Undistributed Merger Consideration._ Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates on the date that is six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ and this
_Article 2_. Any portion of the funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ that remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates
on the date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

  

Section 2.4. _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective representatives
shall be liable to any Person in respect of 

  ##### 

  

   

any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

Section 2.5. _Investment of Merger Consideration._ The Paying Agent shall
invest the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.1_ as directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such gain or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ and this _Article 2_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
shall promptly be paid to, Parent. 

  

Section 2.6. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

Section 2.7. _Withholding Rights._ To the extent the Surviving Corporation or
Parent is required or entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of any other Tax Law, the amounts so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

Section 2.8. _Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, all
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, all other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
all right, title and interest in, to and under all of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

Section 2.9. _Stock Transfer Books._ The stock transfer books of Company shall
be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Company. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall, subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Article 2_
by the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby. 

  

Section 2.10. _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but only to the extent required by the DGCL, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
or consented (in writing) to the Merger and who has demanded appraisal for
such shares 

  ##### 

  

   

of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to receive such
cash consideration as determined to be due to such holder as provided in
the DGCL. If, however, such holder withdraws his, her or its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses his, her or its right of
appraisal, in any case, pursuant to the DGCL, then such holders shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as having been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ , without any interest thereon, upon surrender
of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Company shall
provide Parent with (a) prompt written notice of all demands for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock that are received by Company and (b)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to all such demands. Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer
to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands. Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ that is
not distributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
other provisions of this  _Article 2_ because such holders properly
exercised and perfected their dissenters rights with respect to thereto in
accordance with the DGCL may be paid to the holders of such Dissenting Shares
upon written instructions from Parent to the Paying Agent.

   ##### 

  

    

Company Disclosure Schedule does not include Employee Benefit Plans that
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is legally required to maintain pursuant
to the Law of any jurisdiction other than the United States; _provided,
further,_ that the Foreign Benefit Plans (as defined below) are not listed on
_Schedule 3.14(a)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, but Company
shall provide Parent with a correct and complete list of such plans within
thirty (30) days following the date hereof. 

  

 (b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of each Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement that is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, and to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any entity within the same "controlled group" as Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") contributes, has an obligation to contribute or has any liability. With respect to each plan disclosed on _Schedule 3.14(b)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule that is a Multiemployer Plan: (i) if Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate was to experience a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such plan, no withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA would be incurred; and (ii) none of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has received any notification, nor has any reason to believe, that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent or may reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent or to be terminated. During the last five years, none of Company, its current or former Subsidiaries or any current or former ERISA Affiliate has (i) withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial withdrawal under circumstances in which any withdrawal liability was not satisfied in full or (ii) engaged in a transaction that is subject to Section 4069 of ERISA. None of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is or has ever been a party to any multiple employer plan, as that term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code or a multiple employer welfare arrangement as that term is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. 

  

 (c) _Schedule 3.14(c)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of each Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement that is a "single employer plan," as defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate contributes, sponsors or maintains. None of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any outstanding liability under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA. None of the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on  _Schedule 3.14(a)_ or any other plan, fund or program ever maintained or contributed to by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated so as to subject, directly or indirectly, any assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability, contingent or otherwise, or the imposition of any Lien under Title IV of ERISA. No proceeding has been initiated or threatened by any Person (including the PBGC) to terminate any such plan. No "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any such plan, and no such reportable event will occur as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby. No such plan that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not such
deficiency has been waived. 

  

 (d) Company and each of its Subsidiaries have reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all Employee Benefit Plans, except as limited by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or contract with an individual or to the extent applicable Law would prohibit the Company or any Subsidiary from so reserving such right. 

  

 (e) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a currently effective favorable determination letter with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code, and each trust maintained pursuant thereto has been determined to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the IRS. Each such Employee Benefit Plan has been timely amended since the date of the latest favorable determination letter in accordance with all applicable Laws. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably likely to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code or the assertion of claims by "participants" (as that term is defined in Section 3(7) of ERISA) other than routine benefit claims. 

  

 (f) None of Company, its Subsidiaries, the officers or directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Employee Benefits Plans that are subject to ERISA, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502 of ERISA. 

  

 (g) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, there are no claims (except claims for benefits payable in the ordinary course of business and proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations orders), suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against or involving any Employee Benefit Plan, asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan or asserting any claims against any administrator, fiduciary or sponsor thereof. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity involving any Employee Benefit Plans. 

  

 (h) All Employee Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and administered in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except for instances of noncompliance where neither the costs to comply nor the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. All contributions or premiums required to be made with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan, whether by law or pursuant to the terms of the plan or any contract that funds the benefits due thereunder, have been made when due. With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan the liabilities of which have been disclosed on Companys financial statements as included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, no 

   ##### 

  

    

event has occurred since the date of such disclosure that has resulted in a
material increase in such liabilities. 

  

 (i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will: (i) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits; (iii) limit or prohibit the ability to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v) renew or extend the term of any agreement in respect of compensation for an employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would create any liability to Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates after consummation of the Merger. 

  

 (j) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a Contract (including this Agreement) that under any circumstances could obligate it to make payments (either before or after the Closing Date) that will not be deductible because of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. _Schedule 3.14(j)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Employee Benefit Plan that provides for a payment upon a change in control and/or any subsequent employment termination (including any agreement that provides for the cash-out or acceleration of options or restricted stock and any "gross-up" payments with respect to any of the foregoing), but excluding severance plans that are generally applicable to employees of Company and its Subsidiaries. Company makes the additional representation and warranty set forth on _Schedule 3.14(j)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (k) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided written communications to any group of its current or former employees or any of its directors of any intention or commitment to establish or implement any additional material Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement or to amend or modify, in any material respect, any existing Employee Benefit Plan. 

  

 (l) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to the Law of any jurisdiction other than the United States (a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "), except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices, (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement will cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, (iii) all Foreign Benefit Plans have been maintained in accordance with their terms and all requirements of applicable Law, (iv) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate Governmental Entities and (v) to the extent any Foreign Benefit Plan is intended to qualify for special tax treatment, such Foreign Benefit Plan meets all 

   ##### 

  

    

requirements for such treatment. There is no Foreign Benefit Plan with respect
to which Company is obligated to make disclosure in the Company SEC Reports
where Company has not made the disclosure so required. 

  

Section 3.15. _Labor Matters._  

   

 (a) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to, or bound by, any labor agreement, collective bargaining agreement, work rules or practices, or any other labor-related Contract with any labor union, labor organization or works council.

 (c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, (i) there are no unfair labor practice charges or complaints against Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental Entity, (ii) there are no labor strikes, slowdowns, stoppages, walkouts, lockouts or disputes pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against or affecting Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened grievances or arbitration proceedings against Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of or under any labor agreement, collective bargaining agreement, work rules or practices, or any other labor-related Contract with any labor union, labor organization or works council and (iv) Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all hiring and employment obligations under the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs rules and regulations. The execution and delivery of this Agreement did not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, require any consent or approval of, or any consultation with, any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

Section 3.16. _Certain Contracts._  

   

 (a) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract that (i) has been entered into in the one-year period prior to the date of this Agreement and involves or would reasonably be expected to involve, over a period of five years or less, aggregate payments by Company and/or its Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent as of the date of this Agreement or payments to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000,000 or its foreign currency equivalent as of the date of this Agreement (excluding purchase orders and other customer contracts received and accepted by

   ##### 

  

    

Company and Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take
any action or knowingly omit to take any action within its reasonable control
where such action or omission would, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in (A) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 6_

the satisfaction of such conditions. Neither Parent nor Company will directly
or indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other Regulatory
Laws or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the
prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld in light of closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

The parties hereto may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 5.4_ as "Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

the transactions contemplated hereby, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on Company, in each case, measured on a
scale relative to Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Company shall comply with the provisions of _Schedule 5.4(d)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 (i) participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained if and so long as (A) none of Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives has violated any of the provisions of this _Section 5.5_, (B) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor, that (I) such Person is reasonably capable of consummating a Superior Proposal taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of 

   ##### 

  

   

such Acquisition Proposal and (II) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action
would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to Companys stockholders
under applicable Law, (D) at least three Business Days prior to participating
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any
nonpublic information to, such Person, Company provides Parent with written
notice of the identity of such Person and of Companys intention to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or to furnish or
disclose nonpublic information to, such Person, (E) prior to participating in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic
information to, such Person, Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality and standstill agreement containing terms no less restrictive
upon such Person, in any respect, than the terms applicable to Parent under
the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality and standstill agreement
shall not provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with
Company or have the effect of prohibiting Company from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement, and (F) contemporaneously with furnishing
or disclosing any nonpublic information to such Person, Company
furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously delivered or made available by Company to Parent); and 

   

 (ii) approve or recommend, or enter into (and, in connection therewith, effect a Change in Company Recommendation), a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained if and so long as (A) none of Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives has violated any of the provisions of this  _Section 5.5_, (B) Company provides Parent with written notice indicating that Company, acting in good faith, believes that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and, therefore, plans to conduct a meeting of the Board of Directors of Company for the purpose of considering whether the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, which notice shall be delivered to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the date of such meeting of the Board of Directors of Company, (C) during the three Business Day period after Company provides Parent with the written notice described in _clause (B)_ above, Company shall cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with Parent in an effort to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Acquisition Proposal would not constitute a Superior Proposal, (D) notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments pursuant to _clause (C)_ above but after taking into account the results of such negotiations and adjustments, the Board of Directors of Company makes the determination necessary for such Acquisition Proposal to constitute a Superior Proposal, (E) notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments pursuant to _clause (C)_ above but after taking into account the results of such negotiations and adjustments, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that 

   ##### 

  

   

failing to approve or recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (F) not
later than the earlier of the approval or recommendation of, or the execution
and delivery of a definitive agreement with respect to, any such Superior
Proposal, Company (I) terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, (II) makes the payment required to be made pursuant to _Section

shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt written notice to
Parent, of: (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event

publicly communicated to the senior management, Board of Directors or
stockholders of Company, _provided, however,_ that, if Company shall not have

Proposal enter into a confidentiality and standstill agreement in accordance
with _Section 5.5(a)(i)(E)_ and (B) the date of a public announcement by the
third party making such Acquisition Proposal that such Acquisition Proposal
has been withdrawn in its entirety (it being understood that the provisions
of this sentence shall apply with respect to each Acquisition Proposal that
is announced or 

  ##### 

  

   

otherwise publicly communicated in the manner described above from time to
time; accordingly, such eighth paragraph shall not be deemed reinstated if
neither _clause (A)_ nor _(B)_ applies with respect to any other applicable
Acquisition Proposal). 

  

Section 5.14. _Resignations._ Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause
each member of the Board of Directors of Company to execute and deliver a

by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained,
_provided_ that, after the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, no
