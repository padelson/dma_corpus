conditions of the Offer.

terminate or withdraw the Offer without the prior written consent of the
Company. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8,

comments made by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) provide Parent or Merger Sub in
writing any comments the Company or its Representatives may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt
of such comments (and shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt telephonic
notice of any material discussions with the SEC staff), (iv) provide Parent
and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the
responses to any such comments and a copy of any proposed written responses

(c) Stockholder Lists. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause
its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
most recent practicable date and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of and computer or
other electronic files containing stockholders' names and addresses, security
position listings and all other information in the Company's possession
containing information about the beneficial owners of the Shares as may be

of Shares in accordance with Applicable Law (the date of the list used to
determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are
first disseminated, the "Stockholder List Date"). Subject to Applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are necessary 

to communicate the Offer to the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and
their Representatives (i) shall hold in confidence such lists, files and
information and will use such information only in connection with the Offer

promptly either deliver to the Company or destroy, and shall cause their
Representatives to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any
extracts or summaries of such information then in their possession or control

destroyed.

hereunder, waiver of all conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of
such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its
terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree
Street N.E., Atlanta, GA 30309, unless another place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto.

Section 2.04. The Merger.

(a) Effecting the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Parent and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and delivered to the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, all in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, and take all other necessary or
appropriate actions to cause the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h) of
the DGCL without the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company. The Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

(b) Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such
time as when the Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time and date as
may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

(c) Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

(d) Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger. 

Section 2.05. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.05(b), Section 2.07 or Section
2.08, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Offer Price without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

(b) each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (including Shares
held by the Company as treasury stock) or held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary
thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto, and each holder
of a Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time.

Section 2.06. Surrender and Payment.

(a) Paying Agent and Payment Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint and enter into a customary exchange agreement with a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of
paying the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall have deposited with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration
to be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares at the Effective
Time who are entitled to receive Merger Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). To
the extent the amount of the Payment Fund is below the level required to make
prompt payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration for any reason (including
in the event any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion
of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. Any investment of the Payment Fund shall in
all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the former
holder of Shares pursuant to this Article 2. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event no later than the third Business Day after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.05(a), a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery of any certificate or certificates (the "Certificates")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company agree prior
to the 

consummation of the Offer) for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry ("Uncertificated Shares") in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2.

(b) Surrender of Shares. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares promptly upon (i) in the case
of Shares represented by a Certificate, surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii) in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal and receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request). Until so surrendered or transferred, each Certificate and
Uncertificated Share shall represent from and after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
foregoing payments shall be made via check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds, at each such holder's election as specified in the applicable
letter of transmittal.

(c) Unregistered Transferees. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) No Other Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and the
Uncertificated Shares and, from and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, the holder of such Certificate shall be given a copy of a letter of
transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions therein in order to
receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
the Merger.

(e) Termination of the Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.06 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration. 

Section 2.07. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.05 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal,
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be Dissenting
Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.05(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall provide
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.08. Treatment of Equity Awards.

(a) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Stock Unit (including each Company Non-Employee Director
Restricted Stock Unit) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, whether vested or unvested, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of each such Company Restricted Stock Unit to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration per each share
of Company Common Stock underlying each such Company Restricted Stock Unit,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment
pursuant to Section 2.10. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company Restricted
Stock Units the cash payments described in this Section 2.08(a) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within three Business Days of the Effective
Time).

(b) Treatment of Company Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company
Restricted Share to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment pursuant to Section 2.10. The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of Company Restricted Shares the cash payments described in this Section
2.08(b) as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three Business
Days of the Effective Time). 

(c) Treatment of Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted Stock Units. At the
Effective Time, each Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted Stock Unit
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger Consideration per each
share of Company Common Stock underlying each such Company Post-March 1, 2016
Restricted Stock Unit, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment pursuant to Section 2.10, which cash amount will vest
and become payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in accordance
with the vesting schedule applicable to such Company Post-March 1, 2016
Restricted Stock Unit as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the provisions providing for accelerated vesting upon certain
terminations of employment.

(d) Treatment of Company Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Shares. At the
Effective Time, each Company Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the Merger Consideration per each share of Company
Common Stock underlying each such Company Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Share
up to the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company
Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Shares eligible to vest under the applicable
award agreement assuming "target" performance for each applicable performance
measure, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment pursuant to Section 2.10. Such cash amount will vest and become
payable by the Surviving Corporation in equal installments on each of March
15, 2017, March 15, 2018 and March 15, 2019 pursuant to the time-based vesting
schedule applicable to such Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted Stock Unit
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the provisions
providing for accelerated vesting upon certain terminations of employment.

(e) Treatment of Company Senior Executive Stock Price Restricted Stock Units.
At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Senior Executive Stock Price
Restricted Stock Unit shall automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration.

(f) Treatment of Company Stock Options. At least ten Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall provide written notice to the holder of
each then-outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that
such Company Stock Option will accelerate and become vested and exercisable in
full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such holder will have
the right to exercise his or her Company Stock Option in whole or in part at
any time prior to the Effective Time. The holder of each Company Stock Option
that is exercised pursuant to this Section 2.08(f) shall be issued the number
of Shares resulting from such exercise, and such stockholder will thereafter
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares as
provided in Section 2.05. Each Company Stock Option that is not exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically terminate at the Effective
Time under the terms of the Company Stock Plans, in exchange for an amount
equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise
price for each Share subject to such Company Stock Option, provided that if
the exercise price per-Share equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the
amount payable for such Company Stock Option shall be $0.00. 

(g) Payments. With respect to any Company Restricted Stock Unit, Company Non-
Employee Director Restricted Stock Unit, Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted
Stock Unit or Company Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Share and for which
payment in respect thereof as described in this Section 2.08 would violate the
permitted time for delivery or payment prescribed under Section 409A of the
Code, such delivery or payment shall be made on the earliest practicable date
that delivery or payment may be made without violating such applicable
provisions of Section 409A of the Code with such payment to be held through
such permissible payment date in a deferred compensation account for the
benefit of the individual holder (any such payment, a "Deferred Payment").
Except in the case of any Deferred Payment, Parent shall provide to the
Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the obligations (i) under
Section 2.08(a), Section 2.08(b) and Section 2.08(e) no later than the
Effective Time and (ii) under Section 2.08(c) and Section 2.08(d) on or as
soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable vesting date.

(h) Corporate Actions. Prior to consummation of the Offer, the Company shall
take any actions which are necessary to approve and effectuate the provisions

determinations or adopting resolutions of the Company Board or the applicable
committee thereof or any administrator of a Company Employee Plan as may be
necessary, (ii) taking any actions necessary so that each Company Stock Option
with an exercise price that exceeds the Merger Consideration is canceled for
no additional consideration and (iii) satisfying any requirement to notify the
holder of compensatory equity awards as may be required under the Company
Employee Plans. In addition, Parent may request that the Company use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek consents from certain holders of
Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted Stock Units and Company Post-March 1,
2016 Performance Shares prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
treatment of such holders' Company Post-March 1, 2016 Restricted Stock Units
and Company Post-March 1, 2016 Performance Shares pursuant this Section 2.08.
The Company shall ensure that from and after the Effective Time, no Company
Equity Award holder shall have any right with respect to any Company Equity
Award other than to receive the payment provided for in this Section 2.08.

Section 2.09. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, all references herein to specified numbers of shares affected
thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares
affected thereby, including the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately
adjusted.

Section 2.10. Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold from such payment under
any provision of any applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding. 

Section 2.11. No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Shares shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.12. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.

schedule, form or other document or filing required by the Exchange Act to be
filed or furnished by the Company on or after January 1, 2015 (together with
all exhibits thereto and information incorporated by reference therein
(including financial statements or schedules), the "Company SEC Documents").
No Company Subsidiary is required by the Exchange Act to file or furnish any
report, statement, schedule, form or other document with, or make any other
filing with, or furnish any other material to, the SEC.

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended, supplemented or superseded, as of
the date of the most recent such filing prior to the date of this Agreement),
each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended, supplemented or superseded, as of
the date of the most recent such filing prior to the date of this Agreement),
each Company SEC Document and each registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, filed, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) The Company is not subject to any "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act).

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Company's Knowledge, none of the

investigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Company SEC Documents. The Company is in compliance in all
material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of the NYSE.

Section 4.09. Financial Statements; Internal Controls.

(a) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) complied
as of their respective filing dates with the SEC, in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and the Applicable Laws of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with (A) the books and
records of Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries and (B) GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim statements
the omission of footnotes), and (iii) fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated 

Company Subsidiaries at and as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein, all in accordance with
GAAP (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments and the absence of notes).

(b) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" and "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act). The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's
periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required to be made by the Company
under applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's system
of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to
provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
(ii) that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the
authorization of management and the Company Board, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements. Since January 1, 2015, no
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) has been identified by the
Company in the design or operation of such internal controls that would
reasonably be expected to be adverse in any material respect to the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and all
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in internal controls. With respect to each annual
report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on Form 10-Q and each amendment of
any such report included in the Company SEC Documents filed since January 1,
2015, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer of the Company) have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that the Company's
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of such date.

(c) Since January 1, 2015 and prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Company's
Knowledge, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or any other
Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with responsibility
for bookkeeping or accounting functions, has received any bona fide material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or 

auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, whether or not employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, has reported evidence of a material violation of any material
Applicable Law or breach of fiduciary duty by the Company or any of its
respective Representatives to the Company Board or any committee thereof, or
to the General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

Section 4.10. Disclosure Documents. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Offer Documents will, at the time such documents are filed
with the SEC, at any time they are amended or supplemented, at the time they

the time of the consummation of the Offer, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and all
other Applicable Laws. The Schedule 14D-9, at the time such document is filed
with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, at the time it is
published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, at the time of commencement
of the Offer and at the time of the consummation of the Offer, shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their Representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Schedule 14D-9.

Section 4.11. Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Audited Balance Sheet
Date, and through the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and the Company

with past practice in all material respects, (b) there has not been any
Company Material Adverse Effect and (c) neither the Company nor any Company

Agreement, based upon and subject to the assumptions set forth in Section 4.12
of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Company's good faith estimate of all
Transaction Expenses that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will pay or
incur in connection with the Transactions does not exceed 

$7.5 million.

Disclosure Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no Proceeding
pending against or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any current or former director or
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (in their respective
capacities as such), other than any such Proceeding that (a) does not involve
an amount in controversy in excess of $200,000 and (b) does not seek
injunctive or other non-monetary relief that would be material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries, nor any assets used by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in the respective businesses, are, as of the date of this
Agreement, subject to any outstanding Order that would reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As
of the date of this Agreement, there is no Proceeding pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened, seeking to restrain, enjoin or prevent the

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have duly and timely filed or
caused to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions) all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them. Such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct
in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return other than automatic extensions of time to file Tax Returns
obtained in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. All
Taxes due and owing by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid or, where payment is not yet
due, the Company has made an adequate provision for such Taxes in the
Company's financial statements (in accordance with GAAP). No written claim has
been made by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
Company Subsidiary does not file income or franchise Tax Returns that the
Company or the Company Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. The most recent balance sheet included in the Company SEC
Documents as of the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve (in
accordance with GAAP) for all material Taxes payable by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries through the date of such financial statements. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for
Taxes since March 31, 2016 outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past practice. No material deficiencies for Taxes
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been claimed,
proposed or assessed in writing by any Taxing Authority, except for
deficiencies that have been paid or otherwise resolved. No Proceeding is
pending with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
respect of any material Tax.

(b) The Company has Made Available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of all federal, state, local and foreign income, franchise and other material
Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for

(c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have withheld and timely paid each
material Tax required to have been withheld or collected and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, customer, shareholder or other party, and materially complied with
all information reporting and backup withholding provisions of Applicable Law.

(d) There are no Liens for material Taxes upon the assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (other than Permitted Liens referenced in clause (i) of
such definition).

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules: (i) all deficiencies for any material Taxes which have been
proposed, asserted or assessed in writing by any Taxing Authority against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary have been satisfied by payment, settled or
withdrawn; (ii) there are no waivers or extensions of any statute of
limitations currently in effect with respect to Taxes of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; (iii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
been the subject, in writing, of any audit, suit, proceeding, investigation,
claim, examination or other administrative or judicial proceeding ongoing or
pending with respect to any material Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and, to the Company's Knowledge, no such audit, suit, proceeding,
investigation, claim, examination or

Contract or Government Contract Bid, and the Transactions will not result in
any right for any Governmental Authority to access any source code held in
escrow.

(b) To the Company's Knowledge, the Transactions will not give rise to an
organizational conflict of interest ("OCI") as that term is defined in FAR
Subpart 9.5. Section 4.24(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of all OCI mitigation plans entered into or
proposed by the Seller in connection with any Government Contract. The Company
has Made Available to Parent and Merger Sub true, correct and complete copies
of all such OCI 

mitigation plans. The Company is in material compliance with all of its OCI

existence of any prohibited OCI in connection with any Government Contract or
Government Contract Bid.

(c) The Company and Company Subsidiaries do not hold any facility security
clearances, including personnel security clearances subject to the National

compliance in all material respects with the applicable Public Trust position,
all applicable of Director of Central Intelligence Directives, and any
contractual agreements, including the provisions of all applicable DD254s, and
including any requirements therein relating to the provision of notice of this
Agreement. The Public Trust Roster Made Available to Parent are all of the
Public Trust positions necessary to conduct the Business. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of and, to the
Company's Knowledge, there is no, proposed or threatened termination of any
Public Trust position.

(d) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor any of their directors,
officers, principals, employees or consultants is debarred, suspended, deemed
non responsible or otherwise excluded from participation in the award of any
Government Contract or for any reason listed on the List of Parties Excluded
from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs, nor is there any pending
debarment, suspension or exclusion proceeding that has been initiated against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their predecessors, officers,
directors, employees or consultants. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received any written (or to the Company's Knowledge, oral)
notice of any negative determinations of responsibility, as contemplated in
Part 9 of the FAR, and, to the Company's Knowledge, no such negative
determinations of responsibility have been issued, against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

Section 4.25. Brokers' Fees. Except for Evercore, there is no investment
banker, broker, finder or other agent or intermediary that has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, that is entitled to any financial advisory, banking, broker's,
finder's or similar fee or commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions. The Company has Made Available true, correct
and complete copies of all engagement, fee and similar Contracts between the
Company and Evercore.

Section 4.26. Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received an
opinion from Evercore, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and
subject to the matters, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth
therein, the Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable to
the holders of Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective affiliates) in the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. A true, correct and
complete copy of such opinion will promptly be delivered to Parent after the
execution of this Agreement (on a non-reliance basis for informational
purposes only). The Company will, prior to filing the Schedule 14D-9, obtain
all necessary consents of Evercore to permit the Company to include in the
Schedule 14D-9 the opinion described in this Section 4.26, subject to Evercore
reviewing and providing its consent with respect to any references to Evercore
and such opinion in the Schedule 14D-9. 

Section 4.27. Vote Required. If required under Applicable Laws in order to
permit the consummation of the Merger, the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the Shares issued and outstanding on the record date for a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of the Company's capital stock necessary to adopt this
Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the other Transactions.

Section 4.28. Takeover Laws. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
contained in Section 5.09, the Company Board has taken such actions and votes
as are necessary, if applicable, to render the provisions of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other takeover or anti-
takeover statute or similar federal or state Applicable Law, including Section
203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any
other Transaction. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill"
antitakeover plan or similar device in effect that the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is subject to, party to or bound by.

Section 4.29. No Other Representations or Warranties. The Company acknowledges
and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by Parent
and Merger Sub in Article 5, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other
Person is making or has made any representations or warranties, expressed or
implied, at law or in equity, with respect to or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other matter furnished or provided to the Company. The
Company is not relying and specifically disclaims that it is relying upon or
has relied upon any such other representations or warranties that may have
been made by any Person, and acknowledges and agrees that Parent, Merger Sub
and their Affiliates have specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically
disclaim any such other representations and warranties. Nothing in this
Section 4.29 shall impact any rights of any party to this Agreement in respect
of fraud.

12 months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with
a proposed Acquisition Transaction and (D) enforce the provisions of any
existing confidentiality or non-disclosure 

agreement entered into with respect to any potential Acquisition Transaction
(provided, however, that the Company may waive, if requested by the applicable
counterparty, rights under any such confidentiality agreement or similar
Contract to which the Company is a party to the extent necessary to enable
such counterparty to make an Acquisition Proposal). Any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.02(a) by any Company Subsidiary or
Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall constitute a
breach of this Section 6.02(a) by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company receives an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02),
the Company and the Company Board and their Representatives may, subject to
compliance with this Section 6.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with,
or furnish any information and reasonable access to, such Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives if the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal and financial advisors, and based on information then
available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, or result in, a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
engage in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or
access would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;
provided, that (i) prior to furnishing any material nonpublic information, the
Company receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (and the Company promptly thereafter (but in any event within 24
hours) provides to Parent a copy of any such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) and (ii) any such material nonpublic information so furnished has
been previously provided or made available to Parent or is provided or made
available to Parent substantially concurrently with the furnishing of such
information to such Third Party. Without limiting the foregoing (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, without having to determine that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, a
Superior Proposal), the Company may, following the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal, contact the Third Party that has made such Acquisition Proposal to
(i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof solely to
facilitate the Company Board's determination of whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result
in, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) inform such Third Party of the provisions of
this Section 6.02.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this Section 6.02(c)
or in (and in connection with terminating this Agreement pursuant to) Section
6.02(d), until the termination of this Agreement, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or
modify), the Board Recommendation, (B) take any action to exempt any Person
(other than Parent and its Affiliates) from the provisions of Section 203 of
the DGCL or any other applicable state takeover Applicable Law, (C) if an
Acquisition Proposal has been made public, fail to publicly reaffirm the Board
Recommendation within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in writing
(provided, that (x) if after such request has been made another Acquisition
Proposal (or amendment thereto) has been made public that requires a response
from the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9, the deadline to make such public
reaffirmation shall be extended to the date the Company is required to file a
Schedule 14D-9 in respect of such public Acquisition Proposal) and (y) Parent
may not request any such reaffirmation more than once with respect to any
particular Acquisition Proposal or any public disclosure of a material
amendment to the terms thereto), (D) fail to recommend, in 

a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
10 Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, or (E)
approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Change in Recommendation"), or (ii)
approve, adopt or recommend, propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend,
or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
with any Third Party providing for an Acquisition Transaction or that requires
by its terms the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate
the Transactions (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to Section
6.02(e), if at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, an Intervening
Event occurs or arises, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation
described in clause (A), (C) or (D) of the definition thereof if the Company
Board determines, after consultation with its legal advisor, that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 6.02(e), at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer
if, in response to an Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to
the holders of Shares under Applicable Law, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company Board shall not be entitled to make a Change in Recommendation in
connection with an Intervening Event or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i) unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four
Business Days' prior written notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") advising
Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in
reasonable detail, as applicable, the material circumstances of the
Intervening Event or the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal, including any material amendment to the terms or conditions
thereof), and (y):

(i) during such four Business Day period (such period, the "Review Period,"
and it being understood that for purposes of calculating the Review Period,
the first Business Day will be the first Business Day after the date of
delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice), if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have engaged in good faith negotiations (to the extent the Parent
desires to negotiate) with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this
Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal or to obviate the basis for a Change in Recommendation;
and 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) that may be irrevocably
proposed in writing by Parent (the most recent such adjustments, the "Proposed
Changed Terms") no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth
Business Day of the Review Period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
that, after giving effect to the Proposed Changed Terms, the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal or that the failure to make a
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within the four Business Day period
following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes Proposed Changed
Terms that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) results in
the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal, then
the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i) as a result of such Acquisition Proposal. Any (1) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior
Proposal Notice; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
Review Period with respect to any such new Superior Proposal Notice shall be
only a two Business Day period (and not four Business Days); provided,
further, that in the event there is a material revision to the terms of a
Superior Proposal during a Review Period, the Review Period shall end on the
later of (1) the date the Review Period was originally scheduled to expire and
(2) the second Business Day following the delivery of the Superior Proposal
Notice setting forth such material revision.

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company receives any
Acquisition Proposal and in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the
material terms and conditions (including the identity of the Person making any
such Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
(i) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent of any material
change to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including a summary of
such material changes), (ii) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
advise Parent of any material developments regarding such Acquisition Proposal
and (iii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) after receipt thereof of any written indication of interest, inquiry,
proposal or request for information (or amendment thereto) that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal or
any written material that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment
thereto) including copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements
and any financing commitments related thereto.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (for the avoidance of doubt, it being
understood that any "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated 

by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed a Change in Recommendation), and (iii) making any disclosure
to the holders of Shares if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law; provided, in each case, that no Change in
Recommendation may be made unless the Company shall have first complied with
its obligations under Section 6.02(e).

Section 6.03. Approval of Merger. The Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a
stockholders meeting, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Section 6.04. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable advance notice to the Company,
the Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and each Company Subsidiary to) afford Parent's
officers and Parent's other Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the Pre-Closing Period in a manner that does not
materially interfere with the business of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, to its officers, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records; and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request; provided that none of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary and any Representative of the Company shall be
required to provide such access to or to disclose such information where such
access or disclosure would (i) contravene any Applicable Law or Order
(provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such disclosure on a basis that does not contravene such Applicable
Law or Order), (ii) violate the terms of any Contract of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (provided that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent to permit such disclosure),
or (iii) reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment
of any attorney-client, work product privilege or Intellectual Property right
(provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
allow for access in a manner that does not impair or violate such privileges
or rights, including, as appropriate, providing access to external counsel for
Parent (subject to Parent entering into a customary common interest agreement
with the Company, on terms mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company)).

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 6.01(c), this Section 6.04 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to
affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by
the Company contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parent's or Merger Sub's reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement. 

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that all information provided
to it or any of its Representatives by the Company or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement).

Section 6.05. Notice of Certain Events. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other in writing of:

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent, approval, permission
of or waiver from such party is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions;

(c) any Stockholder Litigation; and

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
(iii)(B), (iii)(C) or (v) of Exhibit A to be satisfied or (ii) a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

No notification given by any party pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall (A)
limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice
in any way the rights and remedies contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed
to affect or modify such party's reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or
cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such
party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the
Offer Conditions in Exhibit A or give rise to any right to terminate this
Agreement under Article 8.

Section 6.06. Employee Benefit Plan Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who are
employed by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"),
Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers, but only if
such service with a predecessor employer is recognized as of the date of this
Agreement in a corresponding Company Employee Plan) prior to the Closing Date
to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of
benefits and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other
welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent
Benefit Plans") (but in any event not for purposes of any accrual under any
cash balance or defined benefit plan or vesting under any equity-based
compensation plan or arrangement) in which any Continuing Employee is or
becomes eligible to participate, to the same extent that such service was
recognized under a similar plan, program, policy, or arrangement of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, except that no such prior service 

credit will be required or provided to the extent that it results in a
duplication of benefits.

(b) For a period of 12 months immediately following the Closing Date (or if
earlier, the date of the Continuing Employee's termination of employment with
the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any Affiliate thereof), Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee (i) a base salary
and target bonus opportunity (or base pay for non-salaried employees) at least
equal to the base salary and target bonus opportunity (or base pay) that such
Continuing Employee had at the Company for the fiscal year in which the
Closing Date occurs and (ii) all other compensation and benefits, that are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding, in all
cases, equity-based compensation defined benefit pension benefits and, except
as provided in a Contract existing as of the date of this Agreement (including
any Company Employee Plan), retiree medical benefits).

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Laws, Parent will cause each such Parent
Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and service conditions (other than with respect to any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a retiree medical plan) with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees, other than (A)
limitations applicable to a particular Continuing Employee under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan or (B) to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods have not already have been satisfied or waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan, except, in the cases of both (A) and (B),
to the extent required by Applicable Laws, (ii) waive all waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied, would have already been satisfied or
would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his
commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan and (iii) credit co-
payments or deductibles paid by Continuing Employees in the plan year in which
the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying any deductible or co-payment
requirements under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing
employment, retention, incentive, change in control and severance agreements
between the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and any Company Employee.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require the providing or
withholding of any compensation or other benefits or privileges) to enter into
the letter agreements with those employees identified on Section 6.06(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules pursuant to which such employee's employment
agreement will be amended as of the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms set forth on Section 6.06(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. 

(e) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this Section 6.06 are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create any
right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any participant in
any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or
any right to continued employment with Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.06 shall be
deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or to
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to permit
any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the Transactions,
or to continue employment after the Closing Date with the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, and any such plan may be amended or terminated by
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
through an action separate and distinct from the actions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

Section 6.07. Termination of 401(k) Plan. If requested by Parent at least 45
days prior to the Closing Date, no later than the Closing Date the Company
Board shall adopt resolutions in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, and deliver a copy of such resolutions to Parent, directing the
adoption of a plan amendment terminating the Monster Worldwide, Inc. 401(k)
Savings Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In such
case, each Continuing Employee shall be permitted, but not required, to roll
over his or her account balance (including any outstanding loans) in the
Monster Worldwide, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan to a 401(k) plan sponsored by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate, and Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate to, take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that any such 401(k) plan shall permit such roll over
promptly after the Effective Time.

Section 6.08. State Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

Section 6.09. Obligations of Parent.

(a) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, adopt or publicly
propose a plan of complete or partial liquidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other reorganization, or resolutions providing for or
authorizing such a liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization
or other reorganization. 



(c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt
this Agreement and shall provide the Company with a copy of the resolutions
thereto.

Section 6.10. Director and Officer Liability.

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain officers' and
directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the
Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in satisfying
its obligation under this Section 6.10(a), Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 250% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, cause to be maintained
policies of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including,
in respect of the Transactions, and which it is hereby acknowledged by Parent
are permitted to be obtained by the Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time so long as the Company has consulted with Parent in advance of obtaining
such policies. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such policies in full force and effect
for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) each indemnification, exculpation or expense reimbursement or advance
agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries and any individual who at the Effective Time
is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of,
or serving as a director or officer of another Person at the request of, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary (each, an "Indemnified Party", and each such
indemnification agreement, a "DandO Indemnification Agreement")), and (ii) any
indemnification or expense reimbursement or advance provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. For a
period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Party with respect to any action or omission occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or before the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the DandO Indemnification Agreements to continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms 

following the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim or Proceeding
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time in
connection with such Indemnified Party's service as a director or officer of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or acts or omissions in connection with
such Indemnified Party's service as officer, director, member, trustee or
other fiduciary in any other entity if such services were at the request or
direction of the Company); provided, that any Person to whom any funds are
advanced pursuant to the foregoing must, if required by Applicable Law,
provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
the indemnification of such Person is not permitted under Law. In the event of
any such claim or Proceeding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such claim or
Proceeding.

(d) If either of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that a creditworthy entity assumes or an adequate credit support
mechanism supports the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the any Organizational Documents of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, by Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 6.10 shall survive the Effective Time and shall thereafter not be
terminated or amended in any manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party.

Section 6.11. Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances,
approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval,
clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, including in connection with any Regulatory Law (all
of the foregoing, collectively, the "Governmental Consents"), (ii) the
delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers 

from third Persons and (iii) the defending of any Proceedings by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions; provided that in no event shall the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Closing any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any third Person for any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the Transactions under any Contract.
Parent shall not and shall cause its Affiliates to not make any investment,
acquisition, joint venture or any other business combination if such
investment, acquisition, joint venture or business combination would
reasonably be expected to materially delay, impede or prevent the satisfaction
of the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)(A) of Exhibit A
(but for purposes of clause (iii)(A) of Exhibit A only if any such Order or
Applicable Law arises under any Regulatory Law. The Company shall not and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to not make any investment, acquisition,
joint venture or any other business combination if such investment,
acquisition, joint venture or business combination would reasonably be
expected to materially delay, impede or prevent the satisfaction of the Offer
Conditions set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)(A) of Exhibit A (but for
purposes of clause (iii)(A) of Exhibit A only if any such Order or Applicable
Law arises under any Regulatory Law.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in (i)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or Governmental
Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental Authorities
(including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not made prior to
the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such applications and
filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days after the date hereof
with respect to filings or submissions required under the HSR Act). Each party
shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be requested by any Governmental Authority,
including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any
request under or with respect to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation, any
other Governmental Consent and any such other Applicable Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the FTC or the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or filings or the
Transactions.

(c) Subject to Section 6.11(e), Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
FTC, the DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities, or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction (including multinational
or supranational), or any other Person, may assert under any Applicable Law
with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Applicable Law that may be asserted by any Person with
respect to the Merger, in each case so as to enable the Transactions to occur
as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the End Date). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, without Parent's prior written
consent, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the
Company's prior written consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any
waiting period under any Applicable Law or any agreement not to consummate the
Transactions. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required to
take any action pursuant to this Section 6.11 unless it is expressly
conditioned on the effectiveness of the Merger. 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of the Company and
Parent agrees (i) to cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all registrations, filings, notifications, communications,
submissions and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 6.11, (ii)
to furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any notifications
or filings, (iii) to keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated therein, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any third party or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (iv) to permit the
other party to review and to incorporate the other party's reasonable comments
in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with
respect to obtaining the necessary approvals for the Transactions, and (v) not
to participate in any meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected
to address substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated herein
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions unless, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, it gives the other
party reasonable notice thereof and the opportunity to attend and observe. The
parties shall take commercially reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
Section 6.11 in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege. Parent
and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 6.11(d) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to (and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent) become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion
of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of
business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in any manner, or (iii) impose
any restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EC Merger
Regulation, and all other federal, state, foreign, multinational or
supranational Applicable Laws or Orders, including any antitrust, competition
or trade regulation Applicable Laws, that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition and including any Applicable Laws that relate to foreign
investments. 

Section 6.12. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within two Business Days of being
served, notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation. No
compromise or settlement of any Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by
the Company without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.13. Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree that the initial
press release(s) to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in a
form mutually agreed to by the parties hereto. Thereafter, each of Parent and
the Company agree that no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions shall be issued by any party or its Subsidiaries without prior
consultation with and the prior consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by Applicable Laws or the rules or regulations of the NYSE or any
other Governmental Authority (including the securities exchange on which any
securities of Ultimate Parent are traded) to which the relevant party or its
Affiliates are subject or submit, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and the relevant party will consider such comments
in good faith, provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.13 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed
to be made by the Company in connection with a Change in Recommendation.

Section 6.14. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including any derivative securities with respect to
any equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Section 6.15. Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Expiration Time, the
Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or employee benefit Contracts that are entered into
after the date of this Agreement by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
with current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such Contracts fall within the
safe harbor provisions of such rule.

Section 6.16. Treatment of Company Notes. The Company shall comply in all
material respects with its obligations under the terms of the Indenture,
including within the time periods required by the Indenture, taking all
actions required by it to be taken prior to the Effective Time as a result of
the consummation of the Merger. In addition, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall: (a) upon the occurrence of a "Fundamental Change" (as defined in the
Indenture) make an offer to purchase the Notes and, if holders of Notes
exercise their purchase rights with respect to their Notes, purchase such
Notes, in each case pursuant to Article 15 of the Indenture; (b) convert any
Notes surrendered for conversion by holders thereof, upon compliance with the
provisions of the Indenture, pursuant to the terms of Article 14 of the
Indenture; and (c) take all other actions required in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms of the Indenture (including the time periods specified 

therein), including the giving of any notices that may be required in
connection with the Merger or in connection with any repurchases or
conversions of the Notes occurring as a result of, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement constituting a "Fundamental
Change" or a "Make-Whole Fundamental Change" (each, as defined in the
Indenture), and delivery of any legal opinions, officers' certificates or
other documents or instruments required in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any written notice or communication to or with holders of the
Notes or with the Trustee under the Indenture prior to the dispatch or making
thereof, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives.

Section 6.17. Stock Exchange De-listing. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

Section 6.18. Treatment of Certain Company Indebtedness. If requested by
Parent, the Company will provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger
Sub in arranging for, at the Closing, the termination of the Credit Agreement,
including providing reasonable cooperation in obtaining a customary pay-off
letter and lien releases; provided that in no event shall this Section 6.18
require the Company to cause any such Indebtedness to be terminated prior to
the Effective Time.

Offer:

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(ii) the Company shall have materially violated or materially breached any
provision of Section 6.02; or

(iii) (A) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would give
rise to the failure of any Offer Condition in clause (iii)(B) or (iii)(C) of
Exhibit A and (2) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the
Company within 30 calendar days after written notice has been given by Parent
to the Company of such breach or failure to perform, or (B) a Company Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred; provided, however, that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to 

this Section 8.01(c)(iii) if, at the time such termination would otherwise
take effect in accordance with the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub is in
breach of any provision of this Agreement such that the Company has the right
(or would following notice and an opportunity to cure) to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii); or

(d) by the Company, if:

(i) the Company Board has determined to terminate this Agreement in response

Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.04(b);

(ii) Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (B) is incapable of being
cured or has not been cured by Parent within 30 calendar days after written
notice has been given by the Company to Parent of such breach or failure to
perform; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(d)(ii) if, at the time such termination would
otherwise take effect in accordance with the foregoing, the Company is in
breach of any provision of this Agreement such that Parent has the right (or
would following notice and an opportunity to cure) to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) or Section 8.01(c)(iii); or

(iii) If Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer as provided in Section 2.01(a)
or consummate the Offer in accordance with Section 2.01(d); provided, however,
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(d)(iii) if such failure to commence the Offer resulted from the breach of
this Agreement by the Company.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01
(other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give notice of such termination
to each other party hereto and specify the applicable provision or provisions

any Intentional and Knowing Breach prior to such termination. No termination
of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 9.02. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and in
any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive
the Effective Time; provided, that this Section 9.02 shall not limit any
covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time.

Section 9.03. Amendments and Waivers. Subject to Applicable Law and the
limitations set forth in Section 2.01(b):

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived at any time
before or after approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the parties
hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of
Directors, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case
of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
provided, however, that (i) without the further approval of the Company's
stockholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given that requires
the approval of the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL unless such
required further approval is obtained and (ii) following the consummation of
the Offer, (A) there shall be no amendment made to this Agreement and (B)
there shall be no waiver by the Company (including pursuant to Section
9.03(b)) that would be adverse to the stockholders of the Company (other than
Parent or Merger Sub).

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 9.04. Fees; Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i), the Company shall pay Parent a fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in the amount of $9,000,000 in cash (the "Termination Fee")
substantially concurrently with such termination.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i)
or Section 8.01(c)(ii) then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than two Business Days after termination of this Agreement, pay Parent the
Termination Fee.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company (only if Parent
would be entitled to terminate this Agreement) pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(iii)(A) as a result of an Intentional
and Knowing Breach and (i) at any time on or after the 

date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made to the Company Board or the Company or publicly announced
and (ii) (A) within 12 months after the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, or
(B) within 12 months after the date of such termination, any Acquisition
Transaction is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination
Fee promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the first to
occur of the entry or consummation described in clause (ii); provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 9.04(d), the term "Acquisition
Transaction" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Article 1 except
that the reference to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be a reference to
"50%."

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
Section 9.04 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 9.04 and
not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof.

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
9.04 are an integral part of the Transactions and that without such provisions
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or any portion thereof and Parent or
Merger Sub commences a Proceeding to obtain such payment which results in an
Order against the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the
Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such
Proceeding (collectively, the "Fees"); provided, however, that if such
Proceeding does not result in an Order against the Company for the Termination
Fee or portion thereof, as applicable, Parent shall pay the Company's Fees.
The Company or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly provide the other party
upon request therefor the wire transfer information required to make any
payments pursuant to this Section 9.04.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to Section 8.02 and, with respect to the enforcement of the provisions
of this Section 9.04, Section 9.09, in the event that the Termination Fee is
paid by the Company as required by this Section 9.04, Parent's right to
receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 9.04 (and any reimbursement for Fees pursuant to Section 9.04(f))
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates and Representatives against the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
Representatives, general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
employees, Affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company-Related
Parties") for all damages, costs, fees, expenses, Liabilities, penalties or
losses of any kind suffered as a result of or in connection with this
Agreement (including the negotiation, execution, performance or breach
thereof), the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Company-Related Parties shall have
any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions under any theory of law or equity, contract,
tort or otherwise, except that nothing in this Section 9.04(g) shall limit any
right or remedy of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to fraud or an
Intentional and Knowing Breach by the Company or relieve the Company of any
Liability with respect to any Intentional and Knowing Breach. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, the
provisions of this Section 9.04 shall be subject in all respects to Section
9.09, it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
enforce all of their rights under this Agreement prior to the effectiveness of
a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, and in no event
shall the Company assert Parent's entitlement 

to termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, or the amount of
the Termination Fee that Parent shall become entitled to receive as a result
of such termination, as a basis to oppose any of the remedies as provided in
Section 9.09.

Section 9.05. Assignment; Benefit.

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided that Parent or Merger Sub, upon prior written notice
to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided, further, that no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any
Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, and
permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, except (i) the provisions of Section 6.10 (DandO
Coverage) and Section 9.02 (Survival) shall inure to the benefit of the
Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to be
third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained
therein, (ii) from and after the consummation of the Offer, the rights of the
holders of Shares accepted for payment in the Offer to receive the Offer
Price, as provided in Article 2 and in accordance with the Offer and (iii)
from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the former holders of Shares
and the holders of other Company Securities to receive the Merger
Consideration or such other payments as provided and to the extent set forth
in Article 2. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, no holder of Shares shall have any third-party beneficiary rights
under this Section 9.05 or any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.06. Governing Law. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out of
or related hereto or to the Transactions or to the inducement of any party
hereto to enter into this Agreement, whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Applicable Laws of the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such State that would refer a matter to the Applicable Laws of
another jurisdiction.

Section 9.07. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no
such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court
therefrom, or if such federal court does not have jurisdiction, any court of
the State of Delaware having jurisdiction. Each party hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal
or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this
Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any
such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the Proceeding 

is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the service of process in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner
contemplated by Section 9.01 or in any other manner permitted by Applicable
Law.

Section 9.08. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 9.09. Specific Performance; Remedies. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such
state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action
for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.09, a party
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages)
for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that
this Agreement has been terminated in the event that the remedies provided for
in this Section 9.09 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (b)
nothing set forth in this Section 9.09 shall require any party hereto to
institute any Proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any
Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.09 prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article 8 (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.09 or anything set forth in this Section 9.09
restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article 8 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available at any time.

Section 9.10. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order
that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the 

fullest extent possible.

Section 9.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the exhibits to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules and any
documents delivered by the parties hereto in connection herewith constitute
the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto.

Section 9.12. Rules of Construction. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that it

Exhibit A

Conditions to the Offer

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms set forth
in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to
pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal
of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, if and
only if:

(i) at the Offer Expiration Time, there shall not have been validly tendered
in the Offer (and not otherwise properly withdrawn) that number of Shares
that, together with the number of Shares then-owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, equals at least one Share
more than half of the sum of (without duplication) (i) all Shares then
outstanding (including all outstanding Company Restricted Shares) plus (ii)
all Shares issuable to holders of Notes from whom the Company has received
duly completed notices of exercise plus (iii) all Shares issuable to holders
of Company Stock Options (the "Minimum Tender Condition");

(ii) at the Offer Expiration Time, (A) any applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated
or (B) the approval of the European Commission (or the approval by those
national competition authorities in the European Union that have jurisdiction
as a result of a referral of the Transactions under the EU Merger Regulation)
of the Transactions shall not have been obtained pursuant to the EU Merger
Regulation;

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of Offer
Expiration Time:

(A) any Order issued by a Governmental Authority, or any Applicable Law shall
be in effect that would (1) make the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions illegal or (2) otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation
thereof;

(B) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth (1) in Section
4.06(a), Section 4.06(c) or Section 4.06(d) of the Merger Agreement shall not
be true and correct in all respects, except for any de minimis inaccuracies,
(2) in Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.03, the first sentence of Section
4.07(c), Section 4.25 or Section 4.26 of the Merger Agreement shall not be
true and correct in all material respects, (3) in Section 4.11(b) of the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects, or (4) each
other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in the Merger
Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects (after disregarding
any qualifications that reference material, materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect) except to the extent that any inaccuracies in such
representation or warranty would not have and would not reasonably be expected
to constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, in the case of clauses (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4), as if such
representations and warranties were made on and as of the Offer Expiration
Time (or, in the case 

of such representations and warranties made only as of a specified time or
date, on and as of such specified time or date);

(C) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement prior to such time; or

(D) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
a senior executive officer of the Company dated the date on which the Offer
expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (iii)(B), (iii)(C)
and (v) do not exist;

(iv) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms; or

(v) since the date of this Agreement, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall
have occurred.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in
each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Applicable Law; provided,
that, the foregoing conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (iv) may only be
waived with the prior written consent of the Company. Any reference in this
Exhibit A or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being
satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived.
The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term "Merger Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to which
this Exhibit A is attached.
