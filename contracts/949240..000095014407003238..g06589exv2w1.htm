State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the

Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate
