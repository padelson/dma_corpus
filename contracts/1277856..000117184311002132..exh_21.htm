herein to reflect any difference between Closing Working Capital and Target

(A) "Target Closing Working Capital" shall be ($1,032,159) (i.e., negative
$1,032,159).

  

  

(B) "Unadjusted Closing Working Capital" means (i) the Current Assets of the
Companies, less (ii) the Current Liabilities of the Companies, as determined
as of the close of business on the WC Date.

  

  

(C) "WC Date" means either (i) the last Business Day of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the Closing occurs or (ii) the last Business Day

plus the Excess ADA Capex Amount or less the Shortfall ADA Capex Amount,
whichever is applicable.

the later of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

Closing Date or the WC Date (such sixtieth day being herein called the

Assets shall exclude (x) deferred tax assets and (y) receivables from any of
the Companies' Affiliates, directors, employees, officers or equity holders

election of Purchaser, any accounts receivable that remain uncollected as of
the Settlement Date or as to which a claim for offset or counterclaim has been
made on or before the Settlement Date (any such accounts receivable,
"Uncollected Receivables") may be treated as a reduction to Closing Working
Capital in the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital Statement,
but (A) only to the extent such Uncollected Receivables are in excess of any
reserves for doubtful accounts included in the Closing Balance Sheet and (B)
only if Purchaser promptly thereafter assigns to Seller all of Purchaser's
rights in and to such Uncollected Receivables, without representation or
warranty (other than a representation and warranty that such Uncollected
Receivables are free and clear of Liens, other than Permitted Liens).
Following the Closing, Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect all accounts receivable, and agrees to provide Seller with written
notice of any Uncollected Receivables together with the Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Working Capital Statement. For purposes of determining the amount
of the Closing Working Capital, the amount of the accounts receivable shall
not be reduced to the extent of any amount of such accounts receivable
compromised, settled or adjusted by Purchaser without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. The
parties hereto agree that "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not require
Purchaser to commence any litigation or proceeding, or retain any third
parties (e.g., collection agencies or attorneys), to seek collection of the
accounts receivable.

  

  

(J) "Current Liabilities" means (i) accounts payable of the Companies and (ii)
accrued expenses; provided, however, Current Liabilities shall exclude (x)
accounts payable to any of the Companies' Affiliates, directors, employees,
officers or equity holders and any of their Affiliates to the extent that the
Companies are released from such accounts payable on the Closing Date, (y)

(K) For purposes of this subsection 2.4(a)(i), the terms "deferred tax assets"
and "deferred tax liabilities" refer solely to items attributable to timing
differences of income and deductions for book or financial accounting purposes
and tax accounting purposes.

  

  

(ii) On or before the Settlement Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of the close of business on the
WC Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement of Closing Working
Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Working Capital
Statement"). The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent
with the preparation of the Financial Statements and the principles set forth
on Exhibit B hereto. However, for purposes hereof, (A) if the Closing Date is
later in time than the WC Date, then distributions made by the Companies to
Seller between the WC Date and the Closing Date shall be deducted from the
cash balances of the Companies as of the close of business on the WC Date and
(B) if the WC Date is later in time than the Closing Date, then distributions
made by the Companies to Purchaser between the Closing Date and the WC Date
shall be added back to the cash balances of the Companies as of the close of
business on the WC Date.

  

  

(iii) Acceptance of Statements; Dispute Procedures. The Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Working Capital Statement (and the computation of Closing
Working Capital indicated thereon) delivered by Purchaser to Seller shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties unless Seller, within thirty (30) days
after receipt by Seller of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Statement (and the work papers of Purchaser and its accounting
professionals relating thereto), notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller
disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying in reasonable detail
the nature of the dispute and the basis therefor. The parties shall in good
faith attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the parties so resolve all
disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement
(and the computation of Closing Working Capital indicated thereon), as amended
to the extent necessary to reflect the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If
the parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute within twenty (20)
days after notice is given by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to the second
preceding sentence, the parties shall submit the dispute to UHY, LLP (the
"Arbiter") for resolution. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall submit an
affidavit to the other evidencing no conflict or business relationship with
the selected accounting firm, and such firm shall so certify to Purchaser and
Seller that no conflicts or business relationship exist. Promptly, but no
later than twenty (20) days after appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the Arbiter
shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on
written submissions by Purchaser and Seller (and their respective professional
advisors), and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute and
shall render a reasonably detailed written report as to the resolution of the
dispute and the resulting computation of the Closing Working Capital which
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. In resolving any disputed
item, the Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.4 and
(y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
items claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter
shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and Seller based on the inverse
of the percentage that the Arbiter's determination (before such allocation)
bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally
submitted to the Arbiter. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the Arbiter awards $600 in favor of Seller's position,
60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of the
costs would be borne by Seller.

  

  

(iv) Payment. Upon final determination of Closing Working Capital as provided
in Section 2.4(a)(iii) above, (A) if Closing Working Capital is greater than
Target Closing Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
excess of Closing Working Capital over Target Closing Working Capital and
Purchaser shall promptly, but no later than five (5) Business Days after such
final determination, pay the amount of such difference, together with interest
thereon from the date the Closing Balance Sheet is furnished by Purchaser to
Seller to the date of payment thereof as determined below, to Seller, and (B)
if Closing Working Capital is less than Target Working Capital, the Purchase
Price shall be decreased by the excess of Target Closing Working Capital over
Closing Working Capital and Seller shall promptly, but no later than five (5)
Business Days after such final determination, pay to Purchaser the amount of
such difference, together with interest thereon from the date the Closing
Balance Sheet is furnished by Purchaser to Seller to the date of payment
thereof as determined below. Seller shall retain at least $2 million of the
Closing Payment, and shall not distribute such amount to its equity owners,
until final settlement of the Closing Working Capital and payment of any
amounts that may be payable by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.4(a)(iv)(B).

  

  

(v) Interest. For the purposes of this Section 2.4(a), interest will be
payable at fixed rate of interest equal to the "prime" rate, as announced by
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date, calculated based
on a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

  

  

2.5 Closing Date. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the EDC
Securities provided for in Section 2.1 hereof (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Duane Morris LLP located at 190 S. LaSalle Street, Suite
3700, Chicago, Illinois 60603 (or at such other place as the parties may
designate in writing or by exchange of facsimile or PDF signatures) at 11:00

Business Days if such delay will result in a month-end Closing) after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to

business of owning and operating ATM's (other than Permitted Gaming Cash
Dispensers) located at retail or other business locations anywhere in the
United States or anywhere where the Companies currently do business (a

this Section 6.6(a) shall not restrict the acquisition by Seller or any such
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a
Restricted Business; provided further, that the restrictions contained in this
Section 6.6(a) shall not in any way restrict Seller or any such Affiliates in
connection with their continued ownership of any of Passbox, LLC, EDC, LLLP,
American Gaming Systems LLC or Solutions360 Inc. to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

the extent of the existing business operations and activities of such entities
as currently conducted and (i) in the case of Passbox, LLC, to the extent of
anticipated future activities in the realm of providing digital prepaid
technology and solutions related to connecting a variety of marketers with in-
store consumers via a variety of clerk-assisted and self service mechanisms
(which may include third party ATM's) and (ii) in the case of EDC, LLLP, to
the extent of anticipated future activities in the realm of providing
automated ticket provision and redemption solutions for gaming applications,
which may include the use of Permitted Gaming Cash Dispensers. Seller agrees
to use its reasonable efforts to provide to Purchaser a right of first refusal
to provide the processing services for the ATM functions included in any
Permitted Gaming Cash Dispenser installed by EDC, LLLP during the two (2) year
period following the Closing Date. As used in this Section 6.6(a), the
following terms will have the meanings indicated below:

  

  

(i) "Gaming Cash Dispenser" shall mean any ATM that is used in conjunction
with a video gambling terminal, video lottery terminal or other terminal for
gambling that provides, in addition to traditional automated teller machine
functions, a service for dispensing cash (or a ticket, card or other
electronic code that may be converted into cash or used to purchase goods or
services) as the winnings from playing on such video gambling terminal, video
lottery terminal or other terminal for gambling.

  

  

(ii) "Permitted Gaming Cash Dispenser" shall mean any Gaming Cash Dispenser
installed and operated in a business establishment that is (A) licensed to
serve alcohol beverages and (B) located in a Carve Out State.

  

  

(iii) "Carve Out State" shall mean (A) Illinois and (B) up to four (4)
additional States that may be hereafter designated in a written notice from
Seller to Purchaser; provided, however, in no event shall Nevada ever be a
Carve Out State.

  

  

(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of any Company to leave such
employment; provided, however, this restriction shall not prohibit general
solicitations for employment not specifically targeted at such employees; or
(ii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual customer or supplier of
any Company or any other Person who has a material business relationship with
any Company, to terminate or modify any such actual relationship.

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than
authorized officers, directors and employees of Purchaser or use or otherwise
exploit for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser,
any Confidential Information (as defined below). Seller shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers, directors or
Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law, subpoena
or other judicial process; provided, however, that in the event disclosure is
required by applicable Law, subpoena or other judicial process, Seller shall,
to the extent reasonably possible, provide Purchaser with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order at Purchaser's sole cost. For purposes of this
Section 6.6(c), "Confidential Information" means any proprietary information
with respect to any Company that has economic value, including methods of
operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs, Technology,
inventions, trade secrets, know-how, Software, marketing methods, plans,
personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information or
proprietary matters. "Confidential Information" does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement, (ii) becomes
generally available to the public after the date of this Agreement other than
as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, or (iii)
becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from a third party not bound by a
confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other obligation
restricting disclosure.   

  

(d) Seller shall cause each of the Specified Affiliates to execute and deliver
to Purchaser at the Closing a written agreement in a form approved by
Purchaser whereby each such Specified Affiliate personally undertakes, for the
benefit of Purchaser, to comply with all of the covenants and restrictions
undertaken by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of Section
6.6(a), (b) and (c). As used herein, the term "Specified Affiliate" shall mean
each of Alpine Investors III, L.P. (exclusive of its portfolio companies),
Alpine General Partner III, L.P., Graham Weaver, Mark Hoppe, Mark Strauch, Ed
Page, Mike Hudkins and Jeffrey Keith.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.6 relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of the terms of this Section 6.6 will cause irreparable injury to
Purchaser, the amount of which will be difficult to estimate or determine and
which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any
breach of this Section 6.6 will be inadequate. Therefore, Purchaser may be
entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a
breach of this Section 6.6 without the necessity of proving actual damage. The
rights and remedies provided by this Section 6.6 are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder
or at law or in equity.

  

  

(f) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, or a
specified business limitation of this Section 6.6 is unreasonable, arbitrary
or against public policy, then a lesser period of time, geographical area, or
business limitation which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not
arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable
party.

  

  

6.7 Preservation of Records.

  

  

(a) Subject to any retention requirements relating to the preservation of Tax
records, Seller and Purchaser agree that each of them shall (and shall cause
the Companies to) preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
business of the Companies for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing
Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may
be reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things,
any insurance claims by, legal proceedings against or governmental
investigations of Seller, any Company or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
or in order to enable Seller or Purchaser to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Seller or Purchaser
wishes to destroy (or permit to be destroyed) such records after that time,
such party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other
and such other party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon
prior written notice given to such party within that ninety (90) day period,
to take possession of the records within sixty (60) days after the date of
such notice.

  

  

(b) After the Closing, upon reasonable prior written notice, Purchaser shall
make available to Seller and its accountants, attorneys and representatives,
any of the documents, files, books and records of the Companies (or copies
thereof) delivered or furnished to Purchaser at the Closing as is necessary
for the preparation and filing of any Tax or financial returns, reports or
forms or the defense of any Tax claim, audit, proceeding or assessment, at any
reasonable time during normal business hours.   

  

(c) If Seller or Purchaser (the "Litigant") becomes engaged or participates in
any litigation or claim with any third party in respect of any Company or its
business as conducted on or prior to the Closing Date, the other party shall
cooperate with the Litigant in all reasonable respects in connection
therewith, including making available relevant documents, books and records
and employees who may reasonably be helpful with respect to such litigation or
claim.

  

  

6.8 Publicity. None of Purchaser, Seller or any Company shall issue any press
release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the rules
of the stock exchange on which the stock of Purchaser (or its parent company)
is listed.

  

  

6.9 Notification of Certain Matters; Updates to Schedules. From the date
hereof until the Closing (or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms hereof), Seller shall give notice to Purchaser and Purchaser
shall give notice to Seller, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon
obtaining knowledge of (a) any fact, change, condition, circumstance, event,
occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty in this Agreement made by it to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, (b) any material failure on its part to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder or (c) the institution of or the threat of
institution of any Legal Proceeding against any of Seller, the Companies or
Purchaser related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall be permitted to amend or
supplement the Schedules hereto by written

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

notice to Purchaser but only to the extent any such amendment or supplement is
made as a result of events occurring after the date of this Agreement (and not
as a result of errors in the Schedules delivered on the date of this Agreement
and discovered after the date of this Agreement or as a result of any breach
by Seller or the Companies of any covenant contained in this Agreement). Any
Schedule that is amended or supplemented as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence shall not be effective for purposes of applying the
provisions of Section 7.1(a); however, if the Closing occurs after Seller
amends or supplements any Schedules in accordance with and as permitted by the
immediately preceding sentence, then any such amendment or supplement will be
effective to cure and correct for all purposes any breach of any
representation or warranty that would have existed if Seller had not made such
amendment or supplement, and all references to any section of the Schedules
hereto that is so supplemented or amended shall for all purposes after the
Closing be deemed to be a reference to such section of the Schedules as so
supplemented or amended.

  

  

6.10 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. Purchaser shall cause each
Company to ensure that (a) all rights to indemnification now existing in favor
of any individual who, at or prior to the Closing, was a manager, member,
director or officer of the Company or who, at the request of the Company,
served as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust
associated therewith (collectively, with such individual's heirs, executors or
administrators, the "DandO Indemnified Persons"), as provided in each Company's
certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, by-laws or limited
liability company operating agreement (as applicable) as of the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date, and
(b) the provisions with respect to indemnification and limitations on
liability set forth in each Company's certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation, by-laws or limited liability company operating
agreement (as applicable) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any material respect; provided, that in the event any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
final disposition of any and all such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event Purchaser or any Company, or any of their respective successors
or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other Person or transfers all
or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
successors and assigns of Purchaser or the applicable Company, as the case may
be, to honor the indemnification obligations of Purchaser under this Section
6.10 and the indemnification obligations of each Company under any such
indemnification agreement and the provisions with respect to indemnification

incorporation, certificate of formation, by-laws or limited liability company
operating agreement (as applicable).

the Auction Confidentiality Agreements pertain to (x) any Confidential
Information (as defined in such Auction Confidentiality Agreements) or other
confidential or proprietary information of, involving or otherwise related to
the Companies, (y) any employees of any Company, or (z) any covenants,
agreements or indemnities set forth in such Auction Confidentiality Agreements
involving or otherwise related to, any Company or any transaction or potential
transaction pertaining thereto and covered by such Auction Confidentiality
Agreements, provided that this Section 6.11 shall not apply to Confidential
Information of Seller. Promptly after the Closing, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days thereafter, Seller shall notify, to the extent not
previously notified, each other Person who is a party to an Auction
Confidentiality Agreement to promptly return to Seller or destroy any
Confidential Information, and all written or recorded copies thereof and
written material, memoranda, notes, copies, excerpts and other writings or
recordings whatsoever based upon, containing or otherwise reflecting any

Information pertaining to any of the Companies.

as intended third beneficiaries under, any Applicable Covenants previously
made to Seller (or any of its Affiliates other than the Companies) by any
Company Employee in a written Employment Agreement, Purchase Agreement or
other Contract. As used in this Section 6.12, the term "Applicable Covenants"
shall mean (i) any covenant to refrain from engaging in or otherwise competing

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

with the business of owning, managing, operating and/or exploiting ATM's and

Closing Date, Purchaser will cause EDC ATM, and Seller will cause Passbox,
LLC, to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate an agreement with
respect to the products/services of Passbox, LLC; provided, however, that
neither EDC ATM nor Passbox, LLC shall be under any obligation to enter into
any such agreement.

  

  

6.15 Passbox Office Lease. On or before the Closing Date, Seller will cause
EDC ATM and Passbox, LLC to execute and enter into a written sublease
agreement whereby the oral agreement referenced in Schedule 4.22 concerning
Passbox, Inc.'s use of certain space in EDC ATM's lease space in Walnut Creek,
CA is placed into a binding written agreement in form reasonably approved by
Purchaser.

  

  

6.16 Consent to use of Financial Statements. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Seller's auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, to consent

the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  

  

6.17 Disposition of the Gaming Division. On or before the Closing Date, Seller

8.3 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party
claim may be asserted in good faith by written notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought; provided, however, that failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall not preclude the indemnified party from any
indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this Article VIII except
to the extent that the indemnifying party can reasonably demonstrate actual
loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.

  

  

(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under Section 8.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 8.4) (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnified
party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party
Claim which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying
party. The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt written
notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release or waive the indemnifying
party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the
indemnifying party can reasonably demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a
result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.3, the
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates
to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within five (5) days of
the indemnified party's written notice of the assertion of such Third Party
Claim notify in writing the indemnified party of its intent to do so;
provided, that the indemnifying party must conduct the defense of the Third
Party Claim diligently and timely thereafter in order to preserve its rights
in this regard.

  

  

(c) If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its
election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party
Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the
indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable
actually incurred expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission
of periodic bills, but only if the indemnifying party is otherwise obligated
to indemnify the indemnified party hereunder. If the indemnifying party shall
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may, at its
own expense, participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified
party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties (in
addition to the indemnifying party's own counsel) in connection with any Third
Party Claim.

  

  

(d) The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to the other to such
documents and information as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.3 to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the prior written
consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed) of
the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant or claimants
and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party makes
any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified
party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated between
the parties, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third
Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying
party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall
pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in
accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

8.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) An indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Sections
8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, unless and until the aggregate amount
of Losses incurred by the indemnified party(ies) and indemnifiable under
Sections 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, exceeds Five Hundred Thousand
and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) (the "Basket"); provided, however, if the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the indemnified party(ies) and
indemnifiable under Sections 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, should
exceed the Basket, then the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of
the Losses in excess of the amount of the Basket (i.e., a true deductible and
not a tipping basket) that are subject to indemnification under Sections
8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable; provided further, however, an
indemnifying party shall be liable under Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as
applicable, for all Losses incurred for breaches of the Fundamental
Representations (other than breaches of Section 4.15 (Employee Benefit Plans),
to which the Basket shall apply), including any amounts that are less than the
Basket, without regard to whether or not the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the indemnified party(ies) and indemnifiable under Sections
8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, should ever exceed the Basket.

  

  

(b) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to indemnify any Person
under Sections 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i), as applicable, for an aggregate amount
of Losses exceeding an amount equal to Twelve Million and 00/100 Dollars
($12,000,000.00) (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply
to Losses incurred for breaches of the Fundamental Representations (other than
breaches of Section 4.15 (Employee Benefit Plans), to which the Cap shall
apply). In no event shall Seller's or Purchaser's aggregate liability for
indemnification under or pursuant to this Article VIII exceed the Purchase
Price.

  

  

8.5 Escrow.

  

  

(a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, on behalf of Seller, pay to Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as escrow agent to Purchaser and Seller
pursuant hereto (the "Escrow Agent"), in immediately available funds, to the
interest bearing account established and designated by the Escrow Agent, an
amount equal to Twelve Million and 00/100 Dollars ($12,000,000.00), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement to be in
form and substance mutually acceptable to the parties, which will be executed
at the Closing, by and among Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent (the
"Escrow Agreement").

  

  

(b) Any payment Seller is obligated to make to any Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Article VIII, as may be finally determined pursuant
to this Article VIII, shall be satisfied first by release of funds to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent
within five (5) Business Days after the date notice of any sums due and owing
is jointly given to the Escrow Agent by Seller and the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Party and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Amount. On the
Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrow Amount (to the
extent not utilized to pay Purchaser for any indemnification claim due or
owing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) to Seller, except that
the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the total amount then held by
the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account) equal to the amount of claims for
indemnification under this Article VIII asserted in writing prior to the
Expiration Date but not yet resolved ("Unresolved Claims"). The Escrow Amount
retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the
extent not utilized to pay Purchaser for any such claims resolved in favor of
Purchaser) upon their resolution in accordance with this Article VIII and the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. Under no circumstances shall the Escrow
Agreement serve to create or imply an agreement to create any type of
limitation on the liabilities and obligations of Seller under this Agreement
to the amount of funds held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement. Seller's
liabilities under this Agreement shall apply irrespective of whether such
liabilities may exceed the amount of funds held in escrow pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

8.6 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

  

  

(i) Seller shall timely file all Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date
(taking into account any extensions) and shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes due thereon, except that Purchaser shall pay such Taxes to the extent
that such Taxes are taken into account in the determination of the Closing
Working Capital. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all such Tax
Returns (including, for purposes of this Section 8.6 , any amendments thereto)
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies.
Seller shall provide Purchaser with copies of such completed Tax Returns at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing thereof (or if a Tax
Return is due within 45 days after the Closing Date, as soon as practical
after the Closing Date), along with supporting work papers, for Purchaser's
review and approval. Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for
filing. In the event that Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the
due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved by the Arbiter in
accordance with Section 8.6(d), which resolution shall be binding on the
parties.

  

  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6(a)(i), Purchaser shall cause
to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by each Company after
the Closing Date with respect to taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date, including any Straddle Periods, and, subject to the rights to payment
from Seller under Section 8.6(a)(iii), Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes shown due thereon. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Companies. The Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of such
completed Tax Returns for any Straddle Periods, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing thereof (or if a Tax Return is due within 45
days after the Closing Date, as soon as practical after the Closing Date),
along with supporting work papers, for Seller's review and approval. Seller
and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such
Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Arbiter in accordance with Section 8.6(d),
which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

  

  

(iii) Not later than three (3) days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on any Tax Returns which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to Section 8.6(a)(ii), Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount
of Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns (and in the case of a Straddle
Period, allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 8.6(b)), that are allocable to the period prior to and
including the Closing Date, except to the extent that such Taxes are taken
into account in the determination of the Closing Working Capital.

  

  

(b) Straddle Period Tax Allocation. Each Company will, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, close the taxable period of such Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and such period shall be treated as a "Short
Period." In any case where applicable law does not permit either Company to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Short Period, or in any case in
which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period which includes the
Closing Date (but does not begin or end on that day) (a "Straddle Period"),
the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to
Seller for the period up to and including the close of business on the Closing
Date, and (ii) to Purchaser for the period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any
allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes
attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the
books and records of each Company as of the close of the Closing Date,
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period, and the portion of such Taxes that is attributable to the
operations of either Company for such Interim Period (as defined below) shall
be (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based on income or gross receipts,
the total amount of such Taxes for the period in question multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Interim Period,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period in question, and (ii) in the case of Taxes that are based on income or
gross receipts, the Taxes that would be due with respect to the Interim
Period, if such Interim Period was a separate taxable period

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

determined on a closing of the books method. "Interim Period" means with
respect to any Taxes imposed on either Company on a periodic basis for which
the Closing Date is not the last day of a Short Period, the period of time
beginning on the first day of the actual taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date and ending on and including the Closing
Date, and the period of time beginning on the first day after the Closing Date
with respect to any actual taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date and ending on the last day of such actual taxable period, as
the case may be.

  

  

(c) Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller and the Companies shall, as of the Closing
Date, terminate any tax allocation or tax sharing agreements with respect to
the Companies and shall ensure that such agreements are of no further force or
effect as to the Companies on and after the Closing Date and there shall be no
further liability of the Companies under such agreement.

  

  

(d) Reimbursement of Taxes due to Pre-Closing Consolidated, Combined, or
Unitary Group Status. Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of any unpaid
Taxes imposed on the Companies or on Purchaser that are attributable to any
Company's inclusion in a consolidated, combined, or unitary group prior to the
Closing Date to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount of Taxes that would
have been imposed if the Companies had never been part of a consolidated group
subject to Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 1502 of the
Code, or part of a unitary group or combined group for state, local, or
foreign tax purposes.

  

  

(e) Reimbursement for Carry Backs. If, in any period commencing after the
Closing Date, either Company earns any credit or recognizes any loss which
cannot be applied against its tax liability for such period, and it is
permitted by law to carry back such loss or credit to a period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, and if Seller shall receive a tax refund or any
other tax benefit for the period to which such credit or loss is properly
carried back, then Seller shall immediately remit to the Purchaser the amount
of such tax refund or other tax benefit (net of any Taxes incurred by Seller
with respect to the receipt of such refund) attributable to such carry back.
Seller agrees that it will cooperate with the Purchaser and the Companies and
their respective representatives, in a prompt and timely manner, in connection
with (i) the preparation and filing of, and (ii) any administrative or
judicial proceedings involving, any Tax Return or information filed or
required to be filed by or for the Companies or the Purchaser. Purchaser will
indemnify Seller for any and all Losses incurred by Seller resulting from any
subsequent disallowance or adjustments of such refund or other tax benefit
that has been previously remitted by Seller to the Companies in accordance
with this Section 8.6(e). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless otherwise required by law, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall, for
federal income tax purposes, carryback any loss or credit to the 2008 or 2009
tax years of Efmark.

  

  

(f) Tax Proceedings. In the case of any audit, examination, or other
proceeding ("Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes for which Seller is solely
liable pursuant to this Agreement and for all taxable periods of the Companies
ending on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall promptly inform Seller,
and shall afford Seller, at Seller's expense, the opportunity to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceedings to the extent such Tax Proceedings may affect
the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to this Agreement or
may affect the Taxes of any direct or indirect equity owners of Seller.
Purchaser shall execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney or other
documents necessary to enable Seller to take all actions desired by Seller
with respect to such Tax Proceedings over which Seller has control pursuant to
this Section 8.6(f). Seller shall have the right to control any such Tax
Proceedings, and, if there is substantial authority therefor, to initiate any
claim for refund, file any amended return, or take any other action which it
deems appropriate with respect to such Taxes. If requested by the Purchaser,
Seller shall provide to Purchaser an opinion in form and content reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser from counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser that
there is substantial authority for the position that Seller is taking with
respect to such action, and Purchaser need not and Seller shall not take such
action until such opinion is delivered to Purchaser. Any Tax Proceedings with
respect to Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be controlled by Purchaser.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 8.6(f) to the contrary, Seller
shall not have the right to control any Tax Proceeding, to initiate any claim
for refund, to file any amended return, or to take any other action if, as a
result of such Tax Proceeding, claim for refund, amended return, or other
action, Taxes payable by Purchaser or the Companies for any taxable period
would likely be materially increased unless Seller is obligated to indemnify
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for such increased Taxes pursuant to Section
8.2. Seller shall not agree to any settlement concerning Taxes for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date which may result in an increase in
Taxes (including an increase in any Taxes of the direct or indirect equity
owners of Seller) for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall not agree to
any settlement concerning Taxes for any Straddle Period which may result in an
increase in Taxes for any taxable period ending before the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(g) Transfer Taxes. Seller shall be liable for and shall pay (and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against) all
sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or
taxes or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Body including any
interest and penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Section 754 Election. Seller and Purchaser agree that EDC ATM shall make
an election under Section 754 of the Code (a "Section 754 Election"),
including obtaining any necessary consents therefor, with respect to the sale
of the Class B Units of EDC ATM pursuant to this Agreement and that any Tax
Return prepared under Section 8.6(a) hereof shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the making of a Section 754 Election.

  

  

(i) Certification of Non-Foreign Status. Seller shall furnish to Purchaser on
or before the Closing Date a certification of Seller's non-foreign status as
set forth in Section 1.1445-2(b) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

  

  

(j) Access to Records. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, Seller and the Companies shall give Purchaser and its authorized
representatives full access to all properties, books, records, and Tax Returns
of or relating to the Companies, whether in possession of the Companies,
Seller, or third-party professional advisors or representatives in order that
Purchaser might have full opportunity to make such investigations as it shall
desire to make of the affairs of the Companies. Seller and the Companies shall
ensure that all third-party advisors and representatives of Seller and the
Companies, including without limitation accountants and attorneys, fully
cooperate and be available to Purchaser in connection with such investigation.

  

  

(k) Access to Records Following Closing. Seller agrees that so long as any
books, records, and files retained by Seller relating to the business of
either Company remain in existence and available, Purchaser (at its own
expense) shall have the right upon prior notice to inspect and to make copies
of the same at any time during business hours of Seller for any proper
purpose. Seller shall use reasonable efforts not to destroy or allow the
destruction of any such books, records, and files without first offering in
writing to deliver them to the Purchaser.

  

  

(l) Amended Tax Returns. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or
Section 8.6(d) above or Section 8.6(o) below, Purchaser shall not, nor shall
cause or permit its Affiliates to, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return of any Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date without Seller's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that with respect to the
federal income Tax Returns of Efmark for the 2008 and 2009 tax years, neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall, and neither shall cause or permit its respective
Affiliates to, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any such Tax Returns of
Efmark (unless required to do so by the Internal Revenue Service) without the
prior written consent of Seller or Purchaser (as applicable), which consent
can be withheld for any reason.

  

  

(m) Tax Mitigation. Purchaser and Seller agree, upon request of the other, to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any governmental entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could otherwise be imposed.

  

  

(n) Cooperation. Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.6, any Tax
Claims, and the authorization and execution of any appropriate powers of
attorney and Tax Returns to accomplish the foregoing or to obtain any refunds,
credits or offsets of Taxes. Such cooperation shall include retaining and
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided pursuant to
this Article VIII. The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, retain all Tax Returns of the Companies, schedules and work
papers and all material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of
the Companies for the taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and
for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

relate, without regard to extensions, and (ii) six (6) years following the due
date (including allowed extensions) for such Tax Returns.

  

  

(o) Tax Refunds. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6(e) hereof, any
refund of Taxes or reduction of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that
relates to any of the Companies and that is a refund or reduction of Taxes
received by the Companies with respect to any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date shall be promptly paid over by the Companies to Seller
(net of any Taxes incurred by the Companies with respect to the receipt of
such refund or reduction). At Seller's request, Purchaser shall cause the
Companies to cooperate with Seller in obtaining refunds (or reduction in Tax
liability) that may be available from the carryback of any losses of the
Companies that arise in taxable years ending on or before the Closing Date,
including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. Seller
will indemnify the Companies for any and all Losses incurred by the Companies
resulting from any subsequent disallowance or adjustments of such refund that
has been previously remitted by the Companies to Seller pursuant to this
Section 8.6(o).

  

  

(p) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be resolved by
the Arbiter identified in Section 2.4(a)(iii). The fees and expenses of the
Arbiter shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser on
the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior
to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems
correct, subject to subsequent amendment to reflect the resolution by the
Arbiter.

  

  

8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Seller and Purchaser agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article VIII as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes.

  

  

8.8 Additional Indemnification Provisions.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VIII,
the amount of any Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, under this Agreement will be
reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Selling Shareholder Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, on account of such Losses (net of any reasonable expenses to the
extent actually incurred by such indemnified party in obtaining such recovery)
(such amount, the "Insurance Proceeds"). In no event will an indemnified party
be required to commence litigation in order to recover Insurance Proceeds
unless all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such litigation or
proceeding are paid for in full by the indemnifying party. Purchaser shall
promptly make a claim for Losses under applicable insurance policies to the
extent that it is commercially reasonable to do so. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, all indemnification payments under this
Article VIII will be made when otherwise due hereunder and such payments will
not be delayed in anticipation of Insurance Proceeds; provided, that if an
indemnified party actually receives any insurance proceeds with respect to
Losses after it receives payment or other credit under this Agreement with
respect to such Losses, then a refund equal to the Insurance Proceeds will be
made to the indemnifying party promptly after the indemnified party receives
such insurance proceeds.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VIII,
the amount of any Losses suffered by an indemnified party under this Agreement
will be reduced by an amount equal to the net actual tax benefit realized by
an indemnified party or any of its Affiliates (the "Tax Benefit Recipient")
from any deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund directly attributable to
any Losses (the "Net Tax Reduction") for the taxable year of the Tax Benefit
Recipient in which such Losses are incurred or otherwise taken into account
under applicable income Tax law.

  

  

(c) A good faith dispute between Seller and Purchaser as to whether an
indemnity obligation exists under Article VIII shall not constitute a breach
of a covenant or obligation under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

9.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

  

  

(a) At the election of Seller or Purchaser on or after the ninetieth (90th)
day from the date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date"), if the Closing shall
not have occurred by the close of business on the Outside Date, provided that
the terminating party is not in material default of any of its obligations
hereunder; provided further, however, if the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice issues a Request for Additional Information and
Documentary Materials pursuant to the HSR Act and the waiting period under the
HSR Act has not expired prior to the Outside Date, then Purchaser shall have
the right and option, unless Purchaser is then in material default of any of
its obligations hereunder, to extend the Outside Date for up to an additional
ninety (90) days by notice to Seller given prior to the ninetieth (90th) day
from the date of this Agreement;

  

  

(b) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  

  

(c) by Seller or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; it being agreed that the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination which is appealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to a party if such
Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

(d) by Purchaser if Seller or any Company shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of Seller or the Companies shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a)
or 7.1(b) (as applicable)would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
ten (10) days following receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach
from Purchaser; or

  

  

(e) by Seller if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of Purchaser shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied
and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following receipt by Purchaser
of written notice of such breach from Seller.

  

  

9.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination by Purchaser or
Seller, or both, pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall
terminate, and the purchase of the EDC Securities hereunder shall be
abandoned, without further action by Purchaser, any Company or Seller.

  

  

9.3 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall be relieved of
their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of
such termination and such termination shall be without liability to Purchaser,
Seller or any Company; provided, however, that the obligations of the parties
set forth in this Section 9.3, Article X, Section 6.6(b), Section 6.6(c) and
Section 6.8 hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable
hereunder; provided further, however, that nothing in this Section 9.3 shall
relieve Purchaser, Seller or any Company of any liability for a breach of this
Agreement prior to the effective date of termination.

no event shall any Company bear any of Purchaser's costs, fees and expenses.

10.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

10.8 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this
Agreement except as provided below and for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Seller or Purchaser (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents
shall be void; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign this Agreement and
any or all rights or obligations hereunder (including Purchaser's rights to
purchase the EDC Securities and Purchaser's rights to seek indemnification
hereunder) to any Affiliate of Purchaser, any Person from which it has
borrowed money in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any Person to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
proposes to sell all or substantially all of the assets relating to the
business, but no such assignment shall act to release Purchaser from its
obligations hereunder without the express written consent of Seller. Upon any
such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

  

  

10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the
same agreement. A signature hereto sent or delivered by facsimile or other
electronic transmission shall be as legally binding and enforceable as a
signed original for all purposes. No party hereto shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission to deliver a signature or
the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic
transmission as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

  

  

10.10 Schedules. The information in the Schedules constitutes (a) exceptions
to particular representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of Seller
and the Companies as set forth in this Agreement or (b) descriptions or lists
of items referred to in this Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between
the statements in this Agreement and those in the Schedules, the statements in
the Schedules will control.

  

  

10.11 Reimbursement of Prevailing Party's Fees. The non-prevailing party in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys\' fees and costs) actually incurred by the prevailing party in any
such action, promptly upon reasonable documentation thereof.
