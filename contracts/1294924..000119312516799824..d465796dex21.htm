ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of Pillsbury
Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 2550 Hanover Street, Palo Alto CA 94304 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than five Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date".

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
certificate of merger).

(d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject

 



11  thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_.

(a) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b),
Section 2.02(d), Section 2.03(b), Section 2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive $13.00 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Stock (including all uncertificated shares of Company Stock represented by
book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Stock
(each, a "Certificate")) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without interest in accordance with Section 2.03;

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent, a Company Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto;

 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

 

(d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
Company Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Company Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after
the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration; _provided, however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 2.02(d) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to the Company Stock that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company to act as Paying Agent in the Merger, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.02. The cash
amount so deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to as the "Payment Fund
_._ " The Paying Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in
the manner directed by Parent; _provided, however_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith

 



12  and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $2 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). In the event the Payment Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.02, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section
2.02, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property
of Parent.

 

(b) Promptly and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to the Persons
who were record holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that were
converted pursuant to Section 2.02(a) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration) (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate after input
from the Company, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Book-Entry Shares and Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer to the Paying Agent as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), together with (x) a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal, (y) a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form
W-9 or W-8 (as applicable), and (z) such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share
or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable Tax withholding). Until transferred as
contemplated by this Section 2.03, each Book-Entry Share and Certificate
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.03. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the transfer of
any Book-Entry Share or Certificate. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares and Certificates shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates are
registered.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other amounts
received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates as of the date that is one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders who have not theretofore transferred their Book-Entry Shares
or Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar legal requirements) for satisfaction of
their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.03.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or to any other Person
with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.
Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, any portion of the
Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the holders of Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



13 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with
respect to the shares of Company Stock shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration into which such shares have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement or as provided by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any Book-Entry Shares or Certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for any reason, such Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 2, subject to Applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 

Section 2.04 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each vested Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including any Company Stock Option held by a director that, in
accordance with its terms, becomes vested at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time by reason of the Merger) and that has an exercise price per
share that is less than the Merger Consideration (a "Vested Option") shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested
Option by (ii) the excess of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of the Vested Option (with the aggregate payment
rounded down to the nearest cent), less applicable Tax withholding. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Vested Option with an exercise price per share that
is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
canceled without any consideration to the holder thereof. All such amounts
payable with respect to the Vested Options shall be paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (and
in any event in connection with the next payroll payment that is made at
least five Business Days following the Effective Time).

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
has an exercise price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration (an
"Unvested Option") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without, interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to the Unvested Option by (ii) the excess of the amount of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Unvested Option (with
the aggregate payment rounded down to the nearest cent), which amount shall
be payable, less applicable Tax withholding, in accordance with the applicable
vesting schedule that would have applied to such Unvested Option, but only if
the holder of such terminated Unvested Option satisfies all of the vesting
terms and conditions that would have related to the terminated Unvested
Option (including any continued employment requirements through the applicable
dates of vesting). For avoidance of doubt, each Unvested Option (x) with 

 



14  an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration or (y) that is subject to vesting based on performance criteria
that has not been achieved as of the Effective Time shall be canceled without
any consideration to the holder thereof.

(c) At the Effective Time, each vested Company RSU (including any Company RSU
that, in accordance with its terms, becomes vested at or immediately prior to
the Effective Time by reason of the Merger) (a "Vested RSU") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of shares of Company Stock subject to the Vested RSU, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (with the aggregate payment rounded down to the nearest cent),
less applicable Tax withholding, which amount shall be paid by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time
(and in any event in connection with the next payroll payment that is made at
least five Business Days following the Effective Time).

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU (an "Unvested RSU") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Unvested RSU, by (y) the
Merger Consideration (with the aggregate payment rounded down to the nearest
cent), which amount shall be payable in accordance with the applicable
vesting schedule, less applicable Tax withholding, that would have applied to
such Unvested RSU, but only if the holder of such terminated Unvested RSU
satisfies all of the vesting terms and conditions that would have related to
the terminated Unvested RSU (including any continued employment requirements
through the applicable date of vesting).

(e) At the Effective Time, each unvested share of Company Restricted Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate
payment rounded down to the nearest cent), which amount shall be payable in
accordance with the applicable vesting schedule less applicable Tax
withholding, that would have applied to such unvested share of Company
Restricted Stock, but only if the holder of such terminated Company Restricted
Stock satisfies all of the vesting terms and conditions that would have
related to the terminated unvested share of Company Restricted Stock
(including any continued employment requirements through the applicable date
of vesting).

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company and/or
the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and shall take all
such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs and shares of Company Restricted Stock as
contemplated by this Section 2.04(f).

 



15 Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Stock pursuant to, and in
compliance in all respects with, Section 262 of Delaware Law (any such shares
being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder
effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law respect to such shares as
contemplated by Section 2.05(b)) shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a),
but instead, at the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to
receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with Section 262
of Delaware Law. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware
Law.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.02(a), without duplication or any interest thereon,
and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) reasonably prompt written notice of (A)
any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Delaware Law; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any
such demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, notice or instrument, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

Section __ 2.06 _Withholding Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of applicable Tax law. If the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

Section __ 2.07 _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving

 



16  Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment fund and subject to Section
2.03(c), Parent) will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
2.

 

ARTICLE 3

Section __ 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation_ _._ The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended

actions necessary so that (a) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of the Company at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the

Section 4.17 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plan_.

 

(a) Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and
complete list identifying each material Employee Plan and specifies whether
such plan is a US Plan or an International Plan, provided that, any government
program administered by a

 



29  Governmental Authority and with respect to which the employers sole
obligation is to make contributions in the form of payroll or other taxes, and
any plan, agreement, arrangement, program or policy maintained solely to
comply with statutory requirements shall not be required to be listed on
Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For each material Employee
Plan, the Company has provided or made available to Parent (i) a copy of such
plan (or a description, if such plan is not written) and all amendments
thereto, as applicable, (ii) all trust agreements, insurance contracts or
other funding arrangements and amendments thereto, (iii) the

modifications thereto as well as all annual reports and summary annual

International Plan (other than such plans for which the terms are prescribed
by Applicable Law), the Company has provided to Parent documents that are
substantially comparable (taking into account differences in Applicable Law
and practices) to the documents required to be provided in clauses (i), (ii)
and (vi).

(b) With respect to any US Plan, no non-exempt prohibited transaction
has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any material liability under ERISA
or the Code, and there has been no material breach of any of the duties
imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by
ERISA with respect to the US Plans that would reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed
on the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates (nor any predecessor of any such entity) sponsors, maintains,
administers or contributes to (or has any obligation to contribute to), or has
in the past six years sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to
(or had any obligation to contribute to), or has or is reasonably expected to
have any direct or indirect liability with respect to, any plan that is (i)
subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code).

(c) Each Employee Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
or 457A of the Code has materially complied in form and operation with, all
applicable requirements of Section 409A and 457A of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any agreement to gross-up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any current or former Service Provider for any Tax
incurred by such Service Provider, including under Section 409A, 457A or 4999
of the Code.

(d) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified and has been established pursuant to a preapproved
prototype or volume submitter plan document for which an IRS opinion letter
has been obtained, each trust created thereunder is exempt from Tax under
the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in
the loss of such qualification or exemption. Each US Plan has been maintained,
operated, and administered in compliance in all material respects with its
terms and any related documents or agreements and in compliance in all
material respects with the requirements of Applicable Law, including 

 



30  ERISA and the Code. No events have occurred with respect to any US Plan that
could reasonably be expected result in assessment against the Company of any
material excise taxes under ERISA or the Code.

(e) All contributions, premiums and payments that are due have been made for
each Employee Plan within the time periods prescribed by the terms of such
plan and Applicable Law in all material respects, and all contributions,
premiums and payments for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that
are not due are properly accrued to the extent required to be accrued
under applicable accounting principles in all material respects. To the
knowledge of the Company, all material benefits, expenses and other amounts
due and payable under any Employee Plan prior to the date of this Agreement
have been paid, made or accrued on or before the date of this Agreement.

(f) Except as set forth on Section 4.17(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider (or any
dependents of such Persons) to any payment or benefit, including any bonus,
retention, severance, retirement or job security payment or benefit, (ii)
enhance any benefits or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger
any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other

the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, after Closing, Parent,
to merge, amend or terminate any Employee Plan (excluding any awards under any
Company Stock Plan, and International Plans the continued maintenance of which
is mandated by Applicable Law). The Company and each Company Subsidiary has
reserved all rights necessary to amend or terminate each of the Employee Plans
(excluding International Plans the terms of which are mandated by Applicable
Law) without the consent of any other Person. Except as set forth in Section
2.04, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed or committed
to institute any plan, program, arrangement or agreement for the benefit of
employees or former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other
than the Employee Plans, or to make any amendments to any of the Employee
Plans.

Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasure Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Employee
Plan currently in effect that would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 

(h) Except as set forth on Section 4.17(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Employee Plan provides or promises any post-employment or post-retirement
payments or benefits, including medical, dental, disability, hospitalization,
life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured), to any current or
former Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by Applicable
Law, including the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985).
No Employee Plan provides benefits to any individual who is not a current or
former Service Provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or the
dependents or other beneficiaries of any such current or former Service
Provider.

 



31 (i) With respect to any insurance policy providing funding for benefits under
any Employee Plan, (i) there is no material liability of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss
sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor would there
be any such material liability if such insurance policy was terminated on the
date hereof, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no insurance company
issuing any policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar
proceeding and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceeding with
respect to any such insurer are, to the knowledge of the Company, imminent.

(j) There is no claim or Legal Proceeding (or any basis therefore) (other
than routine claims for benefits) pending against or involving, or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened against or involving any Employee Plan before
any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, including the IRS or the
Department of Labor that, if determined or resolved adversely in accordance
with plaintiffs demands, would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is, and, to the Companys knowledge, for the past five years have
been, in material compliance with all Applicable Laws with respect to labor
relations, employment and employment practices, including those relating to
labor management relations, wages, hours, overtime, discrimination, sexual

wage payment. To the knowledge of the Company, each Service Provider is in
compliance with all applicable visa and work permit requirements.

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (ii) if intended to
qualify for special tax treatment, complies in all material respects with all
the requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to
be funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded,

knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There are no unfair labor practice complaints pending or, to the

or any current union representation questions involving Service Providers.

with WARN in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has taken any action that (i) would reasonably be expected to cause
Parent or any of its Affiliates to have any material liability or other
obligation following the Closing Date under WARN as determined without regard
to any action taken after the Closing, (ii) would constitute a "mass layoff"
or "plant closing" within the meaning of WARN or would otherwise trigger

termination of employment of 50 or more employees or more than 10% of the
employees in any country outside of the United States during any 90 day

applicable) proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance by either Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by either Parent or Merger Subsidiary of the Merger.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with its terms

consents, approvals, orders, waivers, authorizations, actions, nonactions,
registrations, declarations, filings, permits and notices the failure of which
to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Section 5.04 _Non-contravention_ _._ The execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not
and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of any provision of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section

entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
upon Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any license, franchise, authorization,
permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or
relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Parent and
Merger Subsidiary or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
(other than Permitted Lines) on any asset of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary,

stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder

of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve
this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger
Subsidiary necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.09 _Sufficiency of Funds_ _._ Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
have available sufficient funds to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Immediately
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the payment of the Merger Consideration and all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any repayment or refinancing of
indebtedness of the Company required in connection with the Merger,

Parents cooperation to the extent required) and file with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement for the Company Stockholder Meeting that complies
in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder and other Applicable Law as soon as
practicable following the date hereof (and in any event will file the
preliminary Proxy Statement no later than 20 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement). The Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably
requested by Parent to be included therein.

 



45 (b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond
promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within five Business Days) following the later
of (i) the resolution of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and (ii) the expiration of the
ten day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (the later of (i) and (ii), the "Clearance Date")). The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
and a reasonable description of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement received from the SEC or the staff of the SEC. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or written response to staff comments on, the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (a reasonable
amount of time shall be assumed to be a period of five Business Days unless a
shorter period of time is required by Applicable Law or a Governmental
Authority) and including all reasonable comments given by Parent or its
Representatives. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (or
any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) The Company shall in consultation with Parent duly call, establish a
record date for, give notice of, and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting"), so that the Company Stockholder Meeting occurs as soon as
possible following the Clearance Date, and in any event within 25 Business
Days following the date on which the definitive Proxy Statement is initially
mailed to the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Applicable Law
and the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws. The Company shall not include
any other proposals (other than a proposal relating to an advisory vote
relating to executive compensation and the adjournment of the Company
Stockholder Meeting) in the Proxy Statement without the prior written consent
of Parent or unless Parent so reasonably requests. The Company shall not
adjourn, postpone, cancel, recess or reschedule the Company Stockholder
Meeting; provided that (i) the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (but
after

 



46  consultation with Parent) (A) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting, except that,
without the prior written consent of Parent, (1) no single such adjournment or
postponement shall be for more than five Business Days and (2) in no event
may the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed to later than the date that
is 15 Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting
was originally scheduled and (B) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of, and a sufficient period for evaluation by the Companys
stockholders of, any supplemental or amended disclosure document to the extent
that the Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required under Applicable Law, except that the duration of such adjournment or
postponement shall be limited to the minimum duration reasonably necessary to
remedy the circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement, and
(ii) the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting up
to two times for up to 30 days each time upon the request of Parent to the
extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to
allow the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (but not later than 10 days prior to the End Date). Except
during such time as a valid Adverse Recommendation Change is in effect in
accordance with Section 6.03(b), the Company shall solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval in accordance with Applicable Law, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall submit this
Agreement for adoption by its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting
whether or not an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; provided
that the Proxy Statement shall include, if applicable, the disclosure of the
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with Section 6.03(b). 

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
authorize or permit any of its or their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate

Companys stockholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,

participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is
reasonably expected to make, or is otherwise seeking to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to refer the inquiring Third Party to this Section 6.03 and to limit
its conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral), (iii)
(A) publicly propose to, or otherwise change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or

 



47  Merger Subsidiary, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, when mailed, (C) adopt,
approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, or resolve to or

that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to publicly
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Companys stockholders within ten Business Days after the commencement thereof
or (E) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation following
any Acquisition Proposal having been publicly made, proposed or communicated
(and not publicly withdrawn) within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests
in writing ( _provided_ that Parent shall not be entitled to request such
reaffirmation more than one time with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (provided that any modification to the financial or other material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
for purposes of the foregoing) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, _provided
that_ , with respect to any Third Party that was not invited by the Company
to submit an indication of interest or bid to acquire the Company during the
period between June 1, 2016 and the date of this Agreement, if the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the
Company may waive any such standstill provision applicable to such Third
Party solely to the extent necessary to permit such Third Party to make a
confidential Acquisition Proposal to the Companys Board of Directors, or (v)
approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve adopt,
recommend or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term
sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal (whether binding or
nonbinding). It is agreed that any material violation of the restrictions on
the Company set forth in this Section 6.03 by any Representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
by the Company; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this Section 6.03(a)
shall prohibit the Company or its Representatives from contacting in writing
any Person or group of Persons who, following the date of this Agreement, make
an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal with such contact being for the sole
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach
of this Section 6.03(a), so long as the Company otherwise complies with its
obligations under this Section 6.03, including Section 6.03(c), with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates
will not enter into any agreement with any Third Party subsequent to the date
of this Agreement which prohibits the Company or its Affiliates from providing
any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with,
this Section 6.03.

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval:

(i) if the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal from a Third Party, that did not result from a breach of its
obligations in Section 6.03(a)

 



48  or Section 6.03(g) and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions
with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which
shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent within 24 hours
after the Companys entry thereto) with such Third Party with terms in all
material respects no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the confidentiality agreement dated June 21, 2016 between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that all such information
(to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party;

 

(ii) subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(c) and Section
6.03(d) (provided that such compliance shall be in all material respects with
respect to the timeframes for the Companys actions in Section 6.03(c)), the
Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
(A) following receipt of a Superior Proposal or (B) in response to an
Intervening Event; and

(iii) subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(c) and Section
6.03(d) (provided that such compliance shall be in all material respects with
respect to the timeframes for the Companys actions in Section 6.03(c)), and
the procedures set forth in Section 10.01(d)(i) Company may terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal;

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law.

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, the Company has advised Parent on a prompt basis
of the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third
Party, and the Company has notified Parent promptly (but in no event later
than the earliest to occur of (i) one Business Day and (ii) 48 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any request
for information relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has made,
or that is reasonably likely to make, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall provide such notice orally and in writing (email shall be sufficient if
sent in accordance with all of the relevant provisions of Section 11.01
hereof) and shall identify the Third Party making, and the financial and
other material terms and conditions (including the financing thereof) of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or

 



49  request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a prompt basis
(and in any event no later than the earliest to occur of (i) one Business Day
and (ii) 48 hours), of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall promptly (but in no event
later than the earliest to occur of (i) one Business Day and (ii) 48 hours)
after receipt provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and other
written materials sent or provided to the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives after the date of this Agreement
by any Third Party that has made, or that is reasonably likely to make,
an Acquisition Proposal that describes any financial or other material terms
or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any
additional or modified material terms or conditions conveyed orally to the
Company, to the extent not already provided to Parent within the earliest to
occur of (i) one Business Day and (ii) 48 hours after receipt by the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives). The Company
shall provide to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time
it is provided or made available to such Third Party by the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of the their Representatives all
correspondence and other written materials to any Third Party that, after the
date of this Agreement, has made, or that is reasonably likely to make, an
Acquisition Proposal that describes any financial or other material terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of
any additional or modified material terms or conditions conveyed orally by or
on behalf of the Company, to the extent not already provided to Parent). Any
amendment to the financial or other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys
compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the Company notifies Parent (which notice, in
and of itself, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), in
writing at least five Business Days before taking that action, of its
intention to do so (such period, the "Negotiation Period"), including (A) in
the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of
a Superior Proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreements under
which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated (including any
proposed merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, voting
agreement or other similar instrument relating to such Superior Proposal and a
copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not
provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the financial and
other terms thereof)) and the identity of the Third Party making the
Acquisition Proposal, or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change
to be made in response to an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed description of the reasons for making such Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (ii) following the end of the Negotiation Period, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that Parent did not make, within the Negotiation Period, an offer
that (A) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following
receipt of a Superior Proposal, is at least as favorable to the stockholders
of the Company as such Superior Proposal provided, that in the event there is
any modification to the financial or other material terms of any such
Superior Proposal (including any modification in the amount, form or mix of
consideration proposed to be payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to
such Superior Proposal), the Company shall have provided to Parent a notice
of such modification and

 



50  such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new Superior Proposal to which the
requirements of this Section 6.03(d) shall apply; provided, further that with
respect to such new Superior Proposal, the Negotiation Period shall be deemed
to be a three Business Day period rather than a five Business Day period
(except that in no event will the Negotiation Period expire earlier than any
Negotiation Period then in effect would have expired) or (B) in the case of
an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in response to an Intervening
Event, obviates the need for such recommendation change.

 

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal obtained
after the date hereof that is not subject to any due diligence investigation,
does not require a closing condition that the Third Party has obtained
financing or that committed financing actually be funded, and, with respect
to any cash consideration, is fully financed with available cash on hand or
binding written financing commitments in full force and effect, or a
combination of the foregoing, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, taking into
account the identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, all
terms of such Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
deems relevant (including any termination or break-up fees and conditions to
consummation) and the reasonable likelihood and timing of consummation of
such Acquisition Transaction, would be more favorable from a financial point
of view to the Companys stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the
Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d); provided that for purposes of this
definition, all references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be "80%."

 

(f) _Definition of Intervening Event_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Intervening Event" means any material change, event, occurrence or
development that occurs, arises or becomes known to the Board of Directors of
the Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, to the extent that such change,
event, occurrence or development was unknown to the Board of Directors of the
Company and was not reasonably foreseeable, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement; provided that the receipt by the Company, the existence or the
terms of an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal shall not, in any
event, be deemed to constitute an Intervening Event.

(g) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly request any Third Party that has executed a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement and received any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries during the period between June 1,
2016 and the date of this Agreement return or destroy all confidential
information in the possession of such Third Party or its Representatives.

(h)  _"Stop", "Look" and "Listen"_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under United States federal or state law with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and

 



51  disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9,
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, it
being agreed that the making of such communication containing only the
information contemplated by Rule 14d-9f shall not be an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (iii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders that is required by Applicable Law; provided, however, that in
the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), any such disclosure or communication
that constitutes or contains an Adverse Recommendation Change shall only be
made in compliance with this Section 6.03 (excluding this Section 6.03(h)).

 

Section 6.04 _Access to Information_. Subject to the last sentence of this
Section 6.04, from the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to
Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, upon reasonable written
prior notice, the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, offices, properties,
books and records (including Tax records) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii)
instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized Representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, under no circumstances shall
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives be
required to furnish any person with, or be required to provide access to any
person to, information about the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
that is prohibited by any Applicable Law or contractual restraint enforceable
upon the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or where such access to
information would reasonably be expected to involve the waiver of
any attorney-client privilege; provided that the Company will inform Parent
of the general nature of the document or information being withheld and
reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide such document or information in a
manner that would not result in a violation of Law or any such contractual
restraint or the loss or waiver of such privilege.

Section 6.05 _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment in advance on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Merger, and the right to consult on any settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments
into account. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the filing of, or
the threat of the filing of, any such litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall not settle or offer to settle any such litigation without the
prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.06 _Company Notes_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with its obligations under the Company Notes Indenture that
arise as a result of the

 



52  execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the delivery
of any notices, certificates and opinions required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries shall make, change or revoke any material Tax
election, change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method
of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or claims for
material Tax refunds, enter into any material closing agreement within the
meaning of Section 7121 of the Code (or any analogous or similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), request any Tax ruling from a Governmental
Authority, surrender, settle, concede or compromise any material Tax claim,
audit or assessment, surrender or settle any right to claim a material Tax
refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension
or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
or take or omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission
would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax
Asset of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all material Taxes due with respect to any period or
portion thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

 

(c) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred solely by a holder of Company Stock in connection with the Merger,
and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to such Taxes and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such holder.

 

Section 6.08 _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary, including adopting any resolutions or amendments, with
respect to the ESPP to: (a) cause the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP)
ongoing as of the date of this Agreement to be the final Purchase Period under
the ESPP and the options under the ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (i)
the scheduled purchase date for such Purchase Period and (ii) the date that is
five Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, (b) apply
participant accounts in accordance with the ESPP to purchase shares
of Company Stock immediately following the termination of such final offering
period and (c) terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Any shares of Company Stock so purchased shall be treated in accordance
with Section 2.02. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the
participants in the ESPP that have not been used to purchase shares of Company
Stock prior to the termination of the ESPP will be returned to the
participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the ESPP upon the
termination of the ESPP.

 



53 ARTICLE 7

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees that:

 

Section 7.01 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_ _._ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Delaware Law
and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, a written
consent adopting this Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with
Delaware Law.

 

Section __ 7.02 _Director and Officer Liability_ _._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Person") as provided in the
Company Certificate and Company Bylaws or similar governing documents of the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date of the
Agreement and disclosed in Section 7.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the "Indemnification Contracts") (or with respect to Persons who become a
director or officer of the Company prior to the Effective Time, in a form
substantially similar the Indemnification Contracts) for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger) shall be
honored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and shall survive
the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under any and such Indemnification Contracts.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and any successor
to the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), and shall advance and/or reimburse each
Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as
the same are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a 

 



54  final non appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under Applicable Law;
_provided however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for
any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO
Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy as
of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less
favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided, however_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior
to the date of this Agreement (the "Premium Cap") or, if less, the cost of a
policy providing coverage on the same terms as the Companys existing policy
as of the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that the Company or
Parent may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium
tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance with the maximum coverage
available for a total cost equal to the Premium Cap or, if less, the cost of a
single premium tail policy providing the same coverage limits as the Companys
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement. If such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available for a total cost equal to the Premium Cap.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
7.02 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 7.02 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 7.02 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.02, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.02).

 

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or licenses all or substantially all of its
properties and assets (including Intellectual Property Rights) to any Person,
then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that each of
such successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02 to the extent of the
assets transferred to such successor or assign. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Applicable Law,
Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7.02 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies.

 



55 Section 7.03 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (or such shorter period of employment, as the
case may be), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide to each
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries at the Effective Time
(each, a "Covered Employee"), (i) a base salary or rate of pay that is at
least equal to such Covered Employees base salary or rate of pay immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an incentive pay opportunity that is at
least equal, taken in the aggregate and together with base salary or rate of
pay, to such Covered Employees incentive pay opportunity, taken in the
aggregate and together with base salary or rate of pay, immediately prior to
the Effective Time (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (iv) other compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation and employee
benefits that were provided to such Covered Employee under the Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that, for purposes of this
Section 7.03(a)(iv), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
grant equity to such Covered Employee, but equity granted to such Covered
Employee under the Employee Plans prior to the Effective Time shall be
considered in determining whether the incentive pay opportunity provided by
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries to the applicable Covered Employee after the
Effective Time is at least equal to that provided immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(ii).

(b)  _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Employee Plan under which a
Covered Employee receives health, medical, prescription, dental or vision
benefits is terminated and such Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan") following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) use its
or their commercially reasonable efforts to waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee (and any eligible dependents
thereof) for any corresponding Parent Plan providing medical, dental or
vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Plan and (ii) provide such
Covered Employee with credit for any copayments, coinsurance and deductibles
paid under an Employee Plan prior to such Covered Employees coverage under
any Parent Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to
the same extent such credit was given under the Employee Plan such Covered
Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Plan
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
such Parent Plan.

(c) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee
prior to the Effective Time with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
reflected in the records of the Company (or any predecessor entities of
either to the extent the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries provides
such past-service credit under a similar Employee Plan) for purposes of
vesting and eligibility and determining the rate of accrual for leave benefits
under any Parent Plan in which such Covered Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing. In no event shall anything contained in
this Section 7.03(c) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 



56 (d) _Company 401(k) Plans_. At the request of Parent no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary
so that effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate any Employee Plan that includes a 401(k) feature pursuant to
resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors that are reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. In connection with any termination of such plans,
Parent shall permit each Covered Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Covered Employee from
such plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.05, nothing in this Section
7.03, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee or any former
Service Provider or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii)

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

Section 8.01 _Regulatory Approvals, Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare and file as promptly as
practicable with any Governmental Authority or other third party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
and (ii) obtain and maintain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
including the commencement or defense of litigation seeking

 



57  the entry of, or, as the case may be, to effect the dissolution of, any
temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other temporary or
appealable order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the parties hereto understand
and agree that Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to, and,
without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, (A) enter
into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) propose, negotiate, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise that in the case
of the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) would impose or provide for any of the
following: (1) any restrictions on the operation of the business of the
Company by Parent (including the termination or cancellation of all or a
portion of sales contracts with customers), (2) the sale, license, assignment,
transfer, lease, or other divestiture or disposition of the assets,
properties or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries (excluding the Company
following the Effective Time), or (3) the sale, license, assignment, transfer,
lease or other divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that would reduce the reasonably anticipated
benefits to Parent (including anticipated synergies) of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in an amount that is financially
material relative to the value of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
a whole (which the Company shall not undertake, propose or agree to without
Parents consent). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be required to agree to any
term or take any action in connection with obtaining the necessary approvals
from Governmental Authorities or third parties that is not conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall (x) cooperate in all respects
and consult with each other in connection with filings, including by allowing
the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions, (y) promptly inform the other
party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, Governmental Authorities, by promptly providing copies to the other
party of any such written communications and (z) permit the other party to

each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or
conference with Governmental Authorities, and to the extent not prohibited by
a Governmental Authority, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in any in-person meetings with that Governmental Authority. The
Company shall under no circumstances be required to pay or commit to pay any
material amount or incur any material obligation in favor of or offer or
grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise, including any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or
similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any Person to
obtain any consents, approvals, authorizations or terminations or expirations
of any waiting period under any Applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the Parents and Merger Subsidiarys
undertaking pursuant to Section 8.01(a) but subject thereto, each of Parent
and the Company shall (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within 15
Business Days after the date hereof and (ii) make all necessary filings,
notifications and other submissions with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby under other applicable Antitrust Laws
where such filings, notifications or other submissions are

 



58  required, as promptly as practicable and, with respect to (i) and (ii) above
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws
and, subject to the provisions of Section 8.01(a), to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys undertaking pursuant to Section 8.01(a) but subject to the
restrictions thereof, Parent and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval. Such commercially reasonable
efforts shall include promptly after the date hereof making any draft and
final filings (including joint filings) required in connection with the CFIUS
Approval in accordance with the DPA, and providing any information requested
by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection
with the CFIUS review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement within the timeframes required by the DPA, unless CFIUS agrees
in writing to an extension of such timeframe; _provided_ , that in the event
that CFIUS notifies Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company that CFIUS (x)
has completed its review or investigation and (y) intends to send a report to
the President of the United States recommending that the President act
to prohibit the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent may request a withdrawal of any filing or notification made
to CFIUS; _provided_ , however, that if Parent does not re-file a CFIUS
notification within 20 Business Days or such different period of time agreed
upon by the parties, a CFIUS Turndown shall be deemed to have occurred.

 

Section 8.02 _Public Announcements_ _._ Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release,
having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution),
making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and the Company shall not issue any such
press release or make any such other public statement or schedule any such
press conference or conference call without such consultation; _provided,
however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.02 shall not
apply to any release or public statement (a) required by Applicable Law or any
applicable listing authority (in which case the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) consult with each other prior to making any such
disclosure and (ii) cooperate (at the other partys expense) in connection
with the other partys efforts to obtain a protective order), (b) issued by
the Company in response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of
an Acquisition Proposal, or its making of an Adverse Recommendation Change,
(c) following any public statement, release or disclosure by the Company in
respect of any Acquisition Proposal or Adverse Recommendation Change, issued
by Parent with respect to such matters or (d) in connection with any dispute
between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, further_ , that (x) each of the
Company and Parent may make press releases or public announcements concerning
this Agreement or the Merger that consist solely of information previously
disclosed in all material respects in previous press releases
or announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this
Section 8.02 and (y) each of the Company and Parent may make any public
statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or
analysts or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so
long as such statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in
all material respects in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this Section
8.02.

 



59 Section 8.03 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the

execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take

other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

Section 8.04  _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

required to have been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement
or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied; and

 

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Article 9 not
to be satisfied;

_provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.04
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

 

Section 8.05 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company

10.01(b)(i), and at the End Date all conditions to Parents obligations to
consummate the Merger set forth in Article 9, other than the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01(b) (solely due to an Applicable Law that is an
Antitrust Law or which relates to CFIUS), Section 9.01(c) or Section 9.01(d)
have been satisfied (other than those of a nature to be satisfied at Closing,
which shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date

Parents obligations to 

 



67  consummate the Merger set forth in Article 9, other than the conditions set
forth in Section 9.01(b) (solely due to an Applicable Law that is an Antitrust
Law or which relates to CFIUS), Section 9.01(c) or Section 9.01(d), would
have been capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date the
notice of termination was delivered; then Parent shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within two Business Days
after such termination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account directed by the Company.

(d) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if (i) the Company fails
promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to Section 11.04(b), it
shall also pay any reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney fees) incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amount, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made and (ii) Parent fails promptly to pay any
amount due to the Company pursuant to Section 11.04(c), it shall also pay
any reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney fees) incurred by the Company in connection with a legal
action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against Parent or
Merger Subsidiary for such amount, together with interest on the amount of
any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 

(e) _Parent s and Merger Subsidiarys Sole Remedy_. Except in the case of
fraud or a willful breach of the Companys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to termination of
this Agreement, and subject to Parents and Merger Subsidiarys rights set
forth in Section 11.11, Parents right to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b), shall under
the circumstances in which a Company Termination Fee becomes payable, be the
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Parent and Merger Subsidiary against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for any loss or damage suffered as a result of any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or failure to
perform hereunder or other failure of the Merger to be consummated, except
that the Company shall remain obligated for, and Parent and its Affiliates may
be entitled to remedies with respect to, the provisions and agreements
surviving such termination pursuant to Section 10.02. The receipt of the
Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, each
of their Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in connection
with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger (and the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination and such payment shall not be deemed a penalty.

 

(f) _Company s Sole Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or a willful breach
of Parents or Merger Subsidiarys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement,
and subject to the Companys rights set forth in Section 11.11, the Companys
right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent

 



68  Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(c), shall under the circumstances
in which a Parent Termination Fee becomes payable, be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Company against Parent or Merger Subsidiary for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
or failure to perform hereunder or other failure of the Merger to be
consummated, except that the Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall remain
obligated for, and the Company and its Affiliates may be entitled to remedies
with respect to, the provisions and agreements surviving such termination
pursuant to Section 10.02. The receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives and any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
Merger (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination and such payment shall not be deemed a penalty.

 

(g) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not such Company Termination Fee may
be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

 

Section 11.05 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 7.02 and this Section 11.05, shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement except for (i) each Indemnified Person as set
forth in Section 7.02 of this Agreement, (ii) the Company on behalf of the
Companys stockholders to pursue damages (including claims for damages based
on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions to the Companys
stockholders) in the event of the breach of this Agreement prior to the
Closing Date by Parent or Merger Subsidiary as provided in Section 10.02,
which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, and (iii) as expressly set forth in this Agreement. The third-
party beneficiary rights referenced in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence
may be exercised only by the Company (on behalf of the Companys stockholders
as their agent) through actions expressly approved by the Companys Board of
Directors, and no Company stockholder whether purporting to act in its
capacity as a Company stockholder or purporting to assert any right
(derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, will have any right or
ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such right.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time
to time in part, (i) by written notice to the Company, to a wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to participate in the Merger in lieu
of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, in which event all references herein to Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary;  _provided_ that any such assignment shall not materially impede
or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other

 



69  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impair
the rights of the Company under this Agreement and (ii) after the Effective
Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary.

 

Section 11.06 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all actions
(whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, the Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All
Legal Proceedings (whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, the Merger shall be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate
appellate court therefrom), in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such
Legal Proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than
the parties hereto. The parties agree that service of any court paper may be
made in any manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court
rules governing service of process in such court. The parties hereto agree
that a final judgment in any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.07 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 11.08 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature
shall constitute an original for all purposes.

 

Section 11.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be

 



70  invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_. The Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement required to be performed by any
of the parties were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any party of any covenant or obligation contained in
this Agreement, the Company or Parent shall be entitled to obtain, without
proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which such
party may be entitled at law or in equity): (a) a decree or order from a court
of competent jurisdiction of specific performance to enforce the observance
and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b) an injunction from a
court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach.
Each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with any such remedy.
