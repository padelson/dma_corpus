formation. Such Guarantor has the requisite power and authority,  rights and
franchises to own its property and to carry on its business as  now  carried

Section  1.3. No  Conflict. The execution and delivery of this Guaranty by
such  Guarantor (a) are not, and the performance of this Guaranty by such
Guarantor  will not be, in contravention of, or in conflict with, or result

ARTICLE  II

 

 

GUARANTY

 

 

Section  2.1. Guaranty.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the limitations set forth in Section 2.1(b), each Guarantor
hereby absolutely  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to the Company
the prompt payment  (on  demand and in lawful money of the United States)
and performance of such  Guarantor's Pro Rata Portion (as defined below) of
the Guarantied Obligations  (as defined below). The term "Guarantied 
Obligations" as used herein means all obligations of Merger Sub or Parent 
under the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth 
therein (as such provisions may be amended or waived by Merger Sub, Parent 
and  the Company from time to time). Notwithstanding any other provision  of
this Guaranty, payment by any Guarantor hereunder will be due on the 15th 
Business Day  after the date on which the Company notifies such Guarantor
that Merger Sub  or  Parent has failed to pay the Guarantied Obligations
when due in accordance  with  the terms of the Merger Agreement and that the
Company is requesting payment  from such Guarantor.

 

 

(b) The  guaranties and obligations of the Guarantors shall be several and
not joint,  which shall mean that a Guarantor shall be liable to the Company
only to  the  extent of such Guarantor's Pro Rata Portion of the
Guarantied  Obligations. In addition, in no event shall the Guarantors be 
obligated to make payments to the Company with respect to this Guaranty that 
exceed  $35,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Maximum Amount"), it  being
understood that this Guaranty may not be enforced against the Guarantors 
without giving effect to the Maximum Amount. The Company hereby  agrees that
in no event shall the Guarantors be required to pay to the Company  under, in
respect of, or in connection with this Guaranty or the Merger  Agreement
other than as expressly set forth herein. The term "Pro Rata Portion" as 
used herein means (i) with respect to AEP, 98.8864% and (ii) with respect 
to  AOEP, 1.1136%.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in the event that the Company, directly
or indirectly, claims,  attempts, commences litigation or other proceedings
in order to assert, asserts,  demands or otherwise seeks to claim that the
provisions of Section 2.1 hereof  limiting the Guarantors' liability to the
Maximum Amount or that any other  provisions of this Guaranty are illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in whole  or in  part, or attesting any theory of
liability against the Guarantors or any  Affiliates of Guarantors with
respect to the transactions contemplated by  the  Merger Agreement other
than liability of the Guarantors under this Guaranty  (as  limited by the
provisions of Section 2), then (i) the obligations of the  Guarantors under
this Guaranty shall terminate ab initio  and shall thereupon be null  and
void, (ii) if the Guarantors have previously made any payments under  this 
Guaranty, they shall be entitled to recover such payments from the Company 
and  (iii) none of the Guarantors and any Non-Recourse Parties (as defined
below)  shall have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates with
respect  to  the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter (as defined
below), the  transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under
this  Guaranty.

 

 

Section  2.2. Continuing  Guaranty. This is a continuing guaranty of the
Guarantied  Obligations and shall remain in full force and effect until the
earlier to  occur  of (a) the indefeasible payment and performance in full
of the Guarantied  Obligations, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement
by Parent, Merger  Sub  or the Company, in either such case in accordance
with its terms, and only  if  neither Merger Sub nor the Parent has any
liability or financial obligation  to  the Company that survives such
termination or (c) consummation of the  Closing. Upon termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with  its terms, and only if neither Merger
Sub nor Parent has any liability or  financial obligation to the Company that
survives such termination, or upon  consummation of the Closing, this
Guaranty shall automatically become void  and  neither Guarantor shall
thereafter have any liability arising  hereunder. Each Guarantor understands
and agrees that, subject to the  immediately preceding two sentences, this
Guaranty shall be binding upon  the  Guarantor and its successors and
assigns, shall be construed as an absolute,  irrevocable and continuing
guaranty of payment and performance and shall  be  enforceable by the
Company and its successors, transferees and assigns, subject  to the terms
set forth herein. Each Guarantor authorizes Merger Sub,  Parent and the
Company without notice or demand and without affecting such  Guarantor's
liability hereunder, from time to time to make any change to the  terms of
the Merger Agreement or in any other term of all or any of the  Guarantied
Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent  to 
departure from the Merger Agreement or any of the documents executed in 
connection therewith.

 

 

Section  2.3. Nature  of Guaranty. In the event that any payment to the
Company  hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever,  the Guarantors shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the
Guarantied  Obligations as if such payment had not  been  made; provided
that this Section 2.3 shall not apply to any such rescission  or  return by
reason of the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Merger  Sub  or
Parent, which shall be covered by Section 2.5 below. A separate  action or
separate actions under this Guaranty may be brought and prosecuted  against
either Guarantor whether or not any action is brought or prosecuted  against
Merger Sub, Parent, the other Guarantor or any other person or whether 
Merger Sub, Parent, the other Guarantor or any other person is joined in 
any  such action or actions. Any circumstance which operates to toll any 
statute of limitations applicable to Merger Sub or Parent shall also operate 
to  toll the statute of limitations applicable to Guarantor. This  Guaranty
is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of  collection.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2.4. Waivers. Each  Guarantor hereby waives the right to require
the Company to proceed against  Merger Sub, Parent, the other Guarantor or
any other person liable on the  Guarantied Obligations or to pursue any other
remedy in the Company's power  whatsoever, and each Guarantor waives the
right to have the proceeds of property  of Merger Sub, Parent, the other
Guarantor or any other person liable on  the  Guarantied Obligations first
applied to the discharge of the Guarantied  Obligations. When making any
demand on a Guarantor hereunder against  the Guarantied Obligations, the
Company may, but shall be under no obligation  to, make a similar demand on
Merger Sub, Parent or the other Guarantor, and  any  failure by the Company
to make any such demand or to collect any payments  from  Merger Sub, Parent
or the other Guarantor shall not relieve such Guarantor  of  its obligations
or liabilities hereunder. The Company may, at its  election, exercise any
right or remedy it may have against Merger Sub, Parent,  a  Guarantor or any
other person without affecting or impairing in any way the  liability of the
other Guarantor hereunder, except to the extent the Guarantied  Obligations
have been indefeasibly paid, and each Guarantor waives any defense  arising
out of the absence, impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement  or 
subrogation or any other right or remedy of such Guarantor against Merger 
Sub or  Parent, whether resulting from such election by the Company or 
otherwise. Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, all rights and benefits under any applicable law purporting  to  reduce
a guarantor's obligations in proportion to the obligation of the  principal.
Each Guarantor hereby waives any defense based upon or  arising by reason of:
(a) any lack of authority of any officer, director or  any other person
acting or purporting to act on behalf of Merger Sub or Parent,  or any defect
in the formation of Merger Sub or Parent; (b) any act or  omission by Merger
Sub or Parent which directly or indirectly results in  or aids  the
discharge of Merger Sub or Parent or any Guarantied Obligations by operation 
of law or otherwise; or (c) any modification of the Guarantied Obligations, 
in any form whatsoever, including, without limitation, the renewal,
extension,  acceleration or other change in time for payment or performance
of the  Guarantied Obligations, any waiver or modification of conditions
precedent  or  any other change in the terms of the Guarantied Obligations
or any part  thereof. Each Guarantor hereby waives all presentments, demands
for  performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest,
notices  of  dishonor and notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the
existence,  creation or incurring of new or additional obligations. Each 
Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping itself informed 
of  the financial condition of Merger Sub and Parent and of all other
circumstances  bearing upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance by
Merger Sub or Parent  of  the Guarantied Obligations which diligent inquiry
would reveal, represents  that  it has adequate means of obtaining such
financial information from Merger  Sub  and Parent on a continuing basis,
and agrees that the Company shall have  no duty  to advise any Guarantor of
information known  to  it regarding such condition or any such
circumstances. Each Guarantor  hereby waives notice of any action taken or
omitted by the Company in reliance  hereon, any requirement that the Company
be diligent and prompt in making  demands hereunder, notice of any waiver or
amendment of any terms and conditions  of the Merger Agreement, notice of any
default by Merger Sub or Parent or  the  assertion of any right of the
Company hereunder, and any right to plead or  assert any election of remedies
in any action to enforce this Guaranty in  respect of its obligations
hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2.5. Bankruptcy  Not  Discharge. The Company shall not be
obligated to file any  claim relating to any Guarantied Obligation in the
event that Parent or Merger  Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding,  and  the failure of the Company to so
file shall not affect the Guarantors' obligations hereunder. Subject to the
second sentence of Section 2.2,  this Guaranty shall continue to be effective
or be reinstated, as the case  may  be, if at any time payment, or any part
thereof, of any or all of the Guarantied  Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the  Company upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of Merger Sub or  Parent. Notwithstanding any
modification, discharge or extension of  the Guarantied Obligations or any
amendment, waiver, modification, stay or  cure  of the Company's rights
which may occur in any bankruptcy or reorganization case  or proceeding
concerning Merger Sub, or Parent, whether permanent or temporary,  and
whether or not assented to by the Company, each Guarantor hereby agrees 
that  it shall be obligated hereunder to pay and perform the Guarantied
Obligations  and discharge its other obligations in accordance with the terms
of the  Guarantied Obligations as set forth in this Guaranty in effect on the
date  hereof. Each Guarantor understands and acknowledges that by virtue of 
this Guaranty, it has specifically assumed any and all risks of a bankruptcy 
or  reorganization case or proceeding with respect to Merger Sub or  Parent.

 

 

Section  2.6. Guarantor's Understandings  With Respect To Waivers. Each
Guarantor warrants and agrees  that each of the waivers set forth above is
made with such Guarantor's full  knowledge of its significance and
consequences and made after the opportunity  to  consult with counsel of its
own choosing, and that under the circumstances,  the  waivers are reasonable
and not contrary to public policy or law. If  any of said waivers are
determined to be contrary to any applicable law or  public policy, such
waiver shall be effective only to the extent permitted  by  law.

 

 

Section  2.7. Covenants of the  Company. The Company hereby covenants and
agrees that it shall  not institute, directly or indirectly and shall cause
its Affiliates not  to  institute, directly or indirectly, any proceeding or
bring any other claim  arising under, or in connection with, the Merger
Agreement, the transactions  contemplated thereby or the equity commitment
letter between the Company  and  Parent (the "Equity  Commitment Letter"),
against the Guarantors or any Non-Recourse Party,  except for claims against
the Guarantors under this Guaranty (subject to  the  limitations described
herein, including the Maximum  Amount). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this  Guaranty, the Company hereby agrees that to the
extent Parent and Merger  Sub are  indefeasibly relieved in full of their
payment obligations under the Merger  Agreement (other than due to a
rejection of the Merger Agreement in the context  of a bankruptcy or
insolvency of Parent or Merger Sub), the Guarantors shall  be  similarly
relieved of their obligations under this  Guaranty. Notwithstanding

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that may be  expressed or implied in this Guaranty or any document
or instrument delivered  in  connection herewith, by its acceptance of the
benefits of this Guaranty,  the  Company covenants, agrees and acknowledges
that no Person other than the  Guarantors has any obligations hereunder and
that, notwithstanding that the  Guarantors or their general partners may be a
partnership or limited liability  companies, the Company has no right of
recovery under this Guaranty, or any  claim based on the obligations
hereunder against, and no personal liability  shall attach to, the former,
current or future equity holders, controlling  persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers  or general or limited
partners of any of the Guarantors, Parent or Merger  Sub or  any former,
current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,  officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate  (other 
than the Guarantors) or agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, but 
not  including Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, each a "Non-Recourse
Party"),  through Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted  piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of  Parent  or Merger Sub against any Non-Recourse Party (including a
claim to enforce  the  Equity Commitment Letter), by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any  legal  or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable  Law,  or otherwise, and the Company
further covenants, agrees and acknowledges  that  the only rights of
recovery that the Company has in respect of the Merger  Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby are its rights to recover  from Parent and
Merger Sub under and to the extent expressly provided in  the  Merger
Agreement and from the Guarantors (but not any Non-Recourse Party)  under 
and to the extent expressly provided in this Guaranty and subject to the 
Maximum  Amount and the other limitations described herein; provided,
however, that  in  the event a Guarantor (i) consolidates with or merges
with any other person  and  is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger  or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion or its properties  and  other assets to any person such
that the sum of such Guarantor's remaining net  assets plus uncalled capital
is less than such Guarantor's Pro Rata Portion of  the Maximum Amount, then,
and in each such case, the Company may seek recourse,  whether by enforcement
or any judgment or assessment or by any legal or  equitable proceeding or by
virtue of any statue, regulation or other applicable  Law, against such
continuing or surviving entity, but only to the extent  of the  liability of
such Guarantor hereunder. The Company acknowledges and  agrees that Parent
and Merger Sub have no assets other than certain contract  rights and that no
additional funds are expected to be contributed to Parent  or  Merger Sub
unless and until the Closing occurs. Recourse against the  Guarantors under
and pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty shall be the  sole  and exclusive
remedy of the Company and all of its Affiliates against the  Guarantors and
the Non-Recourse Parties in respect of any liabilities or  obligations
arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement, the  Equity
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated thereby, including  by 
piercing of the corporate veil or by a claim by or on behalf of Parent or 
Merger  Sub. Nothing set forth in this Guaranty shall confer or give or
shall  be construed to confer or give to any Person other than the Company,
its  successors, transferees or assigns (including any Person acting in a 
representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any Person including 
the  Guarantors, except as expressly set forth herein.
