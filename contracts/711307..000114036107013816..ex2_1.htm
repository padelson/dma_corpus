AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

This  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 3, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Watsco, Inc., a Florida  corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Coconut Grove Holdings, Inc., a Texas  corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ ") and ACR Group, Inc., a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are  used as defined in Section
9.11.

 



 

WHEREAS,  it is proposed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (as it
may be  amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ")  to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $0.01  per  share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") (other
than Company  Restricted Shares, Converted Company Restricted Shares and
Committed Shares  as  defined herein) at a price of $6.75 per share (such
amount, or any different  amount per share offered pursuant to the Offer in
accordance with the terms  of  this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on
the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS,  it is also proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer,
Merger Sub  will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and each
share  of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to
the Offer  will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash in  an  amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and
subject to the conditions  set  forth herein, in accordance with the Texas
Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") and Texas Business Organization
Code (the " _TBOC_ "), upon  the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company's
Board of  Directors have each unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement
and  deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders  to  consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby,  on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS,  concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a  condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to
enter into  this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are entering
into a Sale  and  Support Agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_   (the " _Sale and Support_ _Agreement_ ").

 



 

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants  and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally  bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as 
follows:

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  I**

 



 

**The  Offer**

 

 

 

**Section  1.1 ****_The  Offer._**

 

 



 

(a) _Provided_   that nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been
commenced, would  give  rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to
any of the conditions set  forth in _Annex I_ , as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof,  Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, commence (within the  meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer at the Offer  Price. Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to accept and
pay for  shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer shall be
subject to the  condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance
with the terms  of  the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Offer (as it may be extended  hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of
shares of Company Common Stock that,  together with the shares of Company
Common Stock subject to a Sale and Support  Agreement (the " _Committed
Shares_ "), represents at least two-thirds (or  such lesser number as may be
determined by Parent and Merger Sub) of all shares  of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to  the other conditions
set forth in _Annex I_. Merger Sub  expressly reserves the right to waive any
of the conditions to the Offer and  to  make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer; _provided_   that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, the Sale and Support Agreement  or previously approved by the
Company in writing, (i) the Minimum Condition  may  not be waived below that
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, together  with the Committed
Shares, represents a majority of all shares of Company Common  Stock then
outstanding **,** (ii) no change may be made that changes  the form of
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer  Price or
the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer,  imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex  I_ , or
otherwise amends or modifies the Offer in any manner materially  adverse to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and (iii) the Offer  may  not
be extended except as set forth in this  Section 1.1(a). Subject to the terms
and conditions of this  Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New
York City time, on the date  that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with  Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)
after the date that the Offer  is commenced. Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer (1) if, at the  scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any
of the conditions to  the  Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived,
from time to time, until the  earliest to occur of (x) the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions, (y)  the  reasonable determination by Parent that
any such condition to the Offer is  not  capable of being satisfied on or
prior to the Walk-Away Date, _provided_   that the inability to satisfy such
condition does not result from any breach  of  any provision of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, and (z) the Walk-Away  Date, and (2) for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation  or  position of
the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period  required
by applicable Law. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger  Sub may, in its
sole discretion, provide one or more subsequent offering periods  (each, a "
_Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of  the
Exchange Act, if, as of the commencement of each such period, the number 
of  shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant  to  the Offer and any prior Subsequent Offering Period, together
with the Committed  Shares, is less than that number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary  to  permit the Merger to be effected without a
meeting of shareholders of the  Company, in accordance with Section 5.16 of
TBCA. Subject to the  foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11,
and upon the terms and  subject to the conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall  cause  Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay
for, as promptly as practicable,  all  shares of Company Common Stock (A)
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant  to the Offer after the final
expiration of the Offer and/or (B) validly tendered  in any Subsequent
Offering Period. The Offer Price payable in respect  of each share of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn  pursuant to the Offer or
validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period  shall be paid net to the
holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any  applicable withholding
Taxes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As  soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent
and Merger  Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with  respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto  and  including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
that shall include the  summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits
or incorporated by  reference thereto, the Offer to Purchase and forms of
letter of transmittal  and  summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the
Offer (collectively, together  with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Offer Documents_ "), and  (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of shares of  Company Common Stock. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent  and Merger Sub in writing all information
concerning the Company that may be  required by applicable securities laws or
reasonably requested by Parent or  Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule
TO or the Offer  Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees
promptly  to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
TO and the  Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become  false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger
Sub  agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so
corrected  to be  filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be disseminated  to  holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent  required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws. The Company and  its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on  the  Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time
before any such document is filed  with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable and good faith  consideration to any comments made by
the Company and its  counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide
the Company and  its counsel with (A) any comments or other communications,
whether written  or  oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time  from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or Offer Documents  promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications, and (B) a  reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger  Sub  to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable  and good faith consideration
shall be given), including by participating with  Parent and Merger Sub or
their counsel in any discussions or meetings with  the  SEC.

 

 

 

**Section  1.2** **_Company  Action._**

 

 

 

(a) (i)  The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that at a
meeting duly  called and held prior to the execution of this Agreement at
which all directors  of the Company were present, the Company's Board of
Directors duly and  unanimously adopted resolutions (A) declaring that this
Agreement and the  Transactions, are in the best interests of the Company's
shareholders, (B)  approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions and (C)  recommending that the Company's shareholders accept the
Offer, tender their  shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to
the Offer and, if  applicable, grant the Company Shareholder Approval
(collectively, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). (ii) The Company
hereby  consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations and
approvals in  the  Offer Documents and, to the extent that no Adverse
Recommendation Change shall  have occurred in accordance with Section 6.3,
the Company hereby consents to  the  inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer  Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish
Parent with a list of  its shareholders, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer file  containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of shares of Company  Common Stock and lists of securities positions
of shares of Company Common  Stock  held in stock depositories, in each case
true and correct as of the most recent  practicable date, and shall provide
to Parent such additional information  (including updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities  positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in  connection with the
Offer. Parent and Merger Sub shall treat the  information contained in such
labels, listing or files and any additional  information referred to in the
preceding sentence in accordance with the terms  and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) As  soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall  file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock,  in each case, as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal  securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9  (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule  14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 6.3, shall
reflect the Company Board  Recommendation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly furnish  to the Company in writing all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub  that  may be required by applicable securities laws
or reasonably requested by the  Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of the Company,  Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by  it  for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall have become  false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company agrees to  take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be  filed  with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common  Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal  securities laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable  opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it  is  filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith  consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their  counsel. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and  their counsel with (i) any comments
or other communications, whether written  or  oral, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the  SEC  or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those  comments or
other communications, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to  participate in
the Company's response to those comments and to provide comments  on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be  given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any 
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 

 

 

**Section  1.3** **_Directors._**

 

 

 

(a) Effective  upon the acceptance for payment of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock  constituting at least the Minimum Condition pursuant to
the Offer and subject  to  the conditions in _Annex I_ , Parent shall be
entitled to designate the  number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company's Board  of Directors that equals the product of (x)
the total number of directors on  the  Company's Board of Directors (giving
effect to the election of any additional  directors pursuant to this
Section), and (y) the percentage that the number  of  shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub  (including
shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment) bears to the  total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company 
shall take all action necessary to cause Parent's designees to be elected or 
appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, including increasing the
number  of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent 
directors. At such time, the Company shall take all action necessary  to
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, 
rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company's 
Board of Directors and (ii) each Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of
the  Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage
as  such  individuals represent on the Company's Board of Directors, in each
case to the  fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing, until Parent and/or Merger Sub acquires a majority of the
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, the
Company shall  use  its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all of the
members of the Company's  Board of Directors and such committees and boards
as of the date hereof who  are  not employees of the Company shall remain
members of the Company's Board of  Directors and such committees and boards.

(b) The  Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company's
Board of  Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule  14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all 
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect  to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f)
and  Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this 
Section. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing any  information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and  affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 



 

(c) Following  the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant
to  Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority
of  the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by
Parent  (the " _Continuing Directors_ ") (or the approval of the sole
Continuing  Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director) shall be
required  to  authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the  Company's Board of Directors and no other action on the
part of the Company,  including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required  to  authorize) any termination of this Agreement
by the Company, any amendment  of  this Agreement, including any decrease in
or change of form of the Merger  Consideration, any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action  hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub,
any waiver of compliance with any of the  agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of the Company, and  any amendment or change to
Section 6.8. Following the election or  appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the  Effective Time, any actions with
respect to the enforcement of this Agreement  by  the Company shall be
effected only by the action of a majority of the Continuing  Directors (or
the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall be  only one
Continuing Director).

**_Section  1.4_ _90% Top-Up  Option._**

 

 

 

(a) The  Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an option (the "
_90% Top Up  Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth
in this  Section 1.4, to purchase that number of shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _90% Top Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
shares of  Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of Committed
Shares, shall  constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company
Common Stock then  outstanding (taking into account the issuance of the 90%
Top Up Option Shares)  at an exercise price per share equal to the Offer
Price; _provided_ that  in no event shall the 90% Top Up Option be
exercisable for a number of shares  of  Company Common Stock (i) that would
require the Company to obtain shareholder  approval under applicable Law, or
(ii) in excess of the Company's then  authorized and unissued shares of
Company Common Stock.

 



 

(b) Merger  Sub may exercise the 90% Top Up Option, in whole but not in part,
at any time  after acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of the number of
shares of Company  Common Stock constituting at least the Minimum Condition
in accordance with  the  Offer and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii)  the  termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

 



 

(c) Parent  and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Company Common
Stock which Merger  Sub may acquire upon exercise of the 90% Top Up Option
will not be registered  under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon an exemption  thereunder for transactions not involving a
public offering. Parent  and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company
that Merger Sub is, or  will  be upon the purchase of the 90% Top Up Option
Shares, an "accredited investor",  as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities  Act. Merger Sub agrees that the 90% Top Up Option and
the 90% Top Up  Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the 90% Top Up
Option are being  and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with  a  view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within  the  meaning of the Securities Act).

Exchange  of**

 

**Certificates**

 



 

**Section  3.1** **_Effect  on  Capital Stock._** At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger  and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or the  holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock  of  Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger

Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and

(c) _Conversion  of Company_ _Restricted Shares and_ _Common Stock_.

 



 

(i) At  the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on

Converted Company Restricted Shares multiplied by  the  Offer Price divided
by the closing price of Parent common stock on the NYSE  on  the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Parent Restricted  Shares_ ") and
each Parent Restricted Share issued pursuant to this Section  3.1(c)(i) shall
remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were  applicable to such
Converted Company Restricted Share (including vesting  schedule and any
acceleration of vesting set forth on Schedule 3.1(c)(II) of  the  Company

restrictions on transferability.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Each  share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to  the Effective Time (other than Company Common Stock received
pursuant  to Section 3.1(a), Cancelled Shares (as defined and to the extent
provided  in Section 3.1(b)), any Converted Company Restricted Shares and any
Dissenting  Shares (as defined and to the extent provided in Section
3.1(d))), shall be  converted into the right to receive $6.75 **** in cash or
any  different amount as may have been paid per share of Company Common Stock
in  the  Offer, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(iii) As  of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(including  Cancelled Shares, Converted Company Restricted Shares and any
Dissenting Shares)  shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and  shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of  shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the
Effective Time  represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each,
a " _Certificate_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or 
non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry  ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect  thereto,

consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry 
Share in accordance with Section 3.2(b),  without interest.

 



 

(d) _Dissenters '  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the  contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
shareholder  who  did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who  is  entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value
of such shares pursuant  to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Articles 5.12  and  5.13 of the TBCA (the " _Dissenting
Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted  into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (the  " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and
together with the Cancelled Shares and the  Converted Company Restricted
Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), but instead  such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in  accordance with the
provisions of Articles 5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA (and at  the  Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease  to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair  value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Articles  5.12 and 5.13 of the TBCA), unless and until such holder shall
have failed  to  perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights
to receive the fair  value of such shares of Company Common Stock under the
TBCA. If any  Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively  withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock shall  thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable  for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration  for  each such share of Company
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 3.1(a),  without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)  prompt notice of any written
demands to exercise dissenter's rights in respect  of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands  and  any other
instruments served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the Company  relating
to shareholders' dissenter's rights and (ii) the opportunity to  participate
in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair  value under
the TBCA. The Company shall not, except with prior  written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or  settle, or offer or
agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any  portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant  to Section 3.2 to
pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which dissenter's  rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon  demand.

**Section  3.2 _Exchange of  Certificates._**

 



 

(a) _Paying  Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a 
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent 
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in 
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms 
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares 
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger, the aggregate 
Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock 
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (other than Company Common 
Stock received pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and the Excluded  Shares). The
Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the  Company's shareholders for
the purpose of holding the Certificates and  shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented by such  Certificates. Parent shall
deposit such aggregate  Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or
prior to the Effective  Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited
with the  Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested  by the Paying Agent in short term investments in direct obligations
of the  United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and
credit of  the  United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of all principal  and interest or commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from  either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's or a combination  thereof as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation; provided that  Parent shall promptly replace any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent  lost through any investment made pursuant to
this paragraph.

 



 

(b) _Payment  Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in  no
event more than five business days thereafter), the Surviving  Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record  of Company
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify  that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or  effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying  Agent, and which
shall be in such form and shall have such other customary  provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent  may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender
of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)  or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger  Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or effective  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation  to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions  (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the  Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration, without  interest, for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by  such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share  so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If payment of the  Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in  whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a  condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be 
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) 
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other 
taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a 
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or 
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving 
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is  not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the  Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger  Consideration as contemplated by this Article III,
without interest, and  any declared and unpaid dividends to which the holder
of such Certificate  is entitled.

(c) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company  Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of  Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or  Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be  deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to  the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by  such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and at the Effective Time, the  stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there  shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books  of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that  were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. From  and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any  rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as  otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to  the last sentence of Section 3.2(e), if, at any
time after the  Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the  Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged  as provided in this Article III.

 



 

(d) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall 
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of  that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or  destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by  such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as  indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to  such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be  paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented  by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article III.

 



 

(e) _Termination  of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of
the  Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require 
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest  received
with respect thereto) that had been delivered to the Paying Agent  and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry  Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the  Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other  similar Laws)
as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of  any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any  Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant  to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts  remaining unclaimed by
such holders at such time at which such amounts  would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority  shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of  the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any  Person previously entitled
thereto.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

(f) _No  Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement  to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or  the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration 
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned 
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding  Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying 
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the  consideration
otherwise payable to any Person who was a holder of shares of  Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be  required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such  payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules  and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any  provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent  amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental  Authority, the withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which  such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

**Section  3.3** **_Adjustments._** Notwithstanding  any provision of this
Article III to the contrary, if between the date of this  Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common  Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a  different class by
reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock  dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split,  combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction, the Offer Price,  the Merger Consideration any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement  shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such stock dividend,  subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination,  exchange of shares or similar
transaction.

(a) The  Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good  standing under the Laws of the State of Texas. The Company has all 
requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of  its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being 
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good 
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted 
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or 
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where 
the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing (or equivalent 
status), individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) 
on the Company (" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). For  purposes of this
Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean, with  respect to any
party, any change, event, development or occurrence that is  materially
adverse to (A) the ability of such party to timely consummate  the

economy or the capital or financial or markets generally,  including changes
in interest or exchange rates, fluctuating commodity  prices and unexpected
product shortages, (ii) changes in general legal,  regulatory, political,
economic or business conditions or changes in GAAP  that, in each case,
generally affect industries in which such party and its  Subsidiaries conduct
business, (iii) the negotiation, announcement,  pendency or consummation of
this Agreement or the Transactions and the identity  of Parent and its
Affiliates, including the impact thereof on  relationships, contractual or
otherwise, with customers, suppliers,  distributors, partners or employees,

product shortages referred  to in clause (i) and each of clauses (ii) and
(iv), other than to  the extent any change, event, development or occurrence
has had or would  reasonably be expected to have a disproportionately adverse
effect on such  party and its Subsidiaries as generally compared to other
participants in  the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries
conduct  business).

equity interests in, each such Subsidiary are owned directly or  indirectly
by the Company free and clear of liens, pledges, security  interests and

15d-15  under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable  assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the  preparation of

**Section  6.1 _Company Disclosure  Documents; Shareholders Meeting; Short-
Form Merger._**

 



 

(a) If  Company Shareholder Approval is required under the TBCA in order to
consummate  the Merger other than pursuant to Section 5.16 of the TBCA, then,
in  accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents, the
Company  shall establish a record date (which will be as promptly as
reasonably  practicable following the consummation of the Offer) for, duly
call, give notice  of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholder  Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the
consummation of the Offer,  for the purpose of voting on the matters
requiring the Shareholder Approval;  _provided_ that (i) if the Company is
unable to obtain a quorum of its  shareholders at such time, the Company may
extend the date of the Shareholder  Meeting by no more than five business
days and the Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts during such five-
business day period to obtain such  a  quorum as soon as practicable, and
(ii) the Company may delay the Shareholder  Meeting to the extent (and only
to the extent) the Company reasonably determines  that such delay is required
by applicable Law or the Company Charter  Documents. Subject to Section 6.3,
the Company's Board of  Directors shall recommend unanimously that the
shareholders of the Company  grant  the Shareholder Approval and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the  Shareholder Approval, and the Company
shall otherwise comply with all applicable  Laws applicable to the
Shareholder Meeting.

 



 

(b) If  the Shareholder Approval is required under the TBCA or TBOC in order
to  consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 5.16 of the TBCA, 
then, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company's Charter Documents,
as  promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, the Company
and  Parent shall prepare jointly and the Company shall file with the SEC
the  applicable Company Disclosure Documents and as soon as practicable
thereafter  use its reasonable best efforts to mail to its shareholders such
Company  Disclosure Documents and all other proxy materials for such meeting,
and if  necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws, after
the Company  Disclosure Documents shall have been so mailed, as promptly as
practicable  circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material,
and, if required  in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. Subject to 
Section 6.3, the Company Disclosure Documents shall contain the unanimous 
recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors to the shareholders of
the  Company to grant the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company and 
Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the
Company  or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with  the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Company
Disclosure  Documents. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable 
opportunity to review and comment on the Company Disclosure Documents before 
such document (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the
SEC,  and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any  comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel. The Company 
shall (i) as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide
Parent  and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and advise
Parent and  its  counsel of any oral comments, with respect to the Company
Disclosure Documents  (or any amendment or supplement thereto) received from
the SEC or its staff,  (ii) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review the  Company's proposed response to such comments,
(iii) give reasonable and good  faith consideration to any comments
reasonably proposed by Parent and its  counsel, and (iv) provide Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to  participate in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC.

Parent, Merger Sub or any  other Subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least
90% of the outstanding Company  Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, through
exercise of the 90% Top Up Option  or  otherwise, the parties hereto shall
take all necessary and appropriate action  to  cause the Merger to be
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition  without a meeting of
shareholders of the Company, in accordance with  Section 5.16 of the TBCA.

past practice and use commercially reasonable efforts  consistent with past
practice to preserve intact its present  business organizations, keep

**Section  6.3 _No  Solicitation._**

 



 

(a) The  Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its 
Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers and employees and  each
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant and each  other
advisor, agent or representative retained by or acting at the  direction of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the  Transactions
(collectively, " _Representative_ _s_ ") to, (i) cease  any discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to an  Alternative Proposal or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an  Alternative Proposal, (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of any  confidential information or
evaluation material previously provided or  furnished to any such Person and
(iii) not terminate, waive, amend, modify  or fail to enforce any provision
of any standstill or  confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a  party. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries  and its and their Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i)  solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or otherwise
knowingly encourage  any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry that constitutes
or would  reasonably be likely to lead to an Alternative Proposal or (ii)
other than  to inform such third party of the provisions of this Section
6.3,  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Alternative  Proposal or any inquiry that constitutes or would reasonably be
likely to  lead to an Alternative Proposal, furnish to any Person any
information or  data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with or take any
action to  knowingly facilitate any proposal that constitutes or would
reasonably be  expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, or requires the
Company to  abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions or
(iii) enter  into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement or  other agreement or understanding relating to, or that would
reasonably be  expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing, prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common  Stock  in the Offer, if the Company's Board of Directors determines,
after  consultation with outside counsel, in good faith by resolution duly
adopted  that an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal received after the
date  hereof other than in breach of this Section 6.3 constitutes or  is
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal and that it is 
reasonably necessary to take such action to comply with its fiduciary  duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the  Company,
after giving Parent prompt written notice of such determination  (and in any
event no later than 24 hours after such determination), may (A)  furnish any
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to  the Person
(and its Representatives) making such Alternative Proposal  pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person  than the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided, that all such information  provided or
furnished to such Person has been provided or furnished  previously to Parent
or is provided or furnished to Parent concurrently  with it being provided or
furnished to such Person and (B) participate in  discussions and negotiations
with such Person (and its Representatives)  regarding an Alternative
Proposal. The Company agrees that  any violation of this Section 6.3(a) by
any Representative of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
a breach of this  Section 6.3(a) by the Company.

 



 

(b) In  the event the Company receives an Alternative Proposal or request
for  information or inquiry that relates to or would be reasonably likely
to  lead to an Alternative Proposal, the Company shall promptly (within 24 
hours) provide Parent with a copy (if in writing) and summary of the 
material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, request or 
inquiry and the identity of the Person (and its equity investors, if known 
by the Company) making such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and
shall  keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any financial or
other  material modifications to such Alternative Proposal, request or
inquiry,  including by conveying a copy of all such modifications that are
in  writing, promptly (within 24 hours) of any of the Company's officers', 
directors' or financial advisors' receipt thereof.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Except  as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(c), the Company's 
Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall not and shall  not publicly
propose to (i)(A) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to  Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (B) recommend to the shareholders  of the
Company, or approve or adopt, an Alternative Proposal or (C) in the  event
that any Alternative Proposal is publicly announced or any Person  commences
a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of  Company
Common Stock, fail to issue a press release that reaffirms the  Company Board
Recommendation and, in the case of a tender offer or exchange  offer,
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer  by the
Company shareholders, in each case within 10 business days of such 
announcement or commencement (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no 
position by the Company's Board of Directors in respect of the acceptance  of
any tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders shall constitute  a
failure to recommend against any such offer) (any action, publicly  proposed
action or inaction described in this clause (i) being  referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii)  enter into, approve or
authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to  enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, or any  merger, acquisition, option,
joint venture, partnership or similar  agreement with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (other than a confidentiality  agreement, subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 6.3(a))  (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the  foregoing, prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common  Stock  in the Offer (x) the Company's
Board of Directors may, subject to compliance  with this Section 6.3,
withdraw or modify the Company Board  Recommendation if the Company's Board
of Directors determines (after receiving  the advice of its outside counsel)
in good faith by resolution duly adopted  that it is reasonably necessary to
do so to comply with its fiduciary  duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law and (y) if  the Company's Board of Directors receives an
Alternative Proposal that the  Company's Board of Directors determines, in
good faith by resolution duly  adopted, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company or its Subsidiaries  may, subject to compliance with this Section
6.3, enter into a definitive  Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal and  concurrently with entering into such Company
Acquisition Agreement  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d).
If the Company  desires to enter into such a Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to  an Alternative Proposal or to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change,  it shall give Parent written notice (a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation  Notice_ ") containing a description of the material
terms of such Alternative  Proposal or any other basis for a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change,  the most current version of any Company Acquisition
Agreement relating to  the Superior Proposal, if any, any other information
required by Section 6.3(b)  and, if applicable, advising Parent that the
Company's Board of Directors has  determined that such Alternative Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and that the  Company's Board of Directors intends to
enter into a Company Acquisition  Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal. The Company  may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) only (i) if at least
five business  days have passed since the date of the Company Adverse
Recommendation  Notice and (ii) if after taking into account any revised
proposal that may  be made by Parent since receipt of the Company Adverse 
Recommendation Notice, the Company's Board of Directors shall have not 
changed its determination that such Alternative Proposal is a Superior 
Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to the financial terms or 
other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company 
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new five business  day period).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Alternative  Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or
not  conditional, from any Person (other than Parent and its  Subsidiaries)
relating to any direct or indirect (A) acquisition of assets  of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries,  but excluding
sales of assets in the ordinary course of business in  compliance with this
Agreement) equal to 15% or more of the Company's  consolidated assets or to
which 15% or more of the Company's revenues or  earnings on a consolidated
basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 15%  or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock, voting power of the  Company or any class of equity
securities of the Company, (C) tender offer  or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person  beneficially owning 15% or more of
the outstanding Company Common Stock,  (D) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business  combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar  transaction involving the Company, (E) acquisition by the Company
or any of  its Subsidiaries of any third party in any of the foregoing types
of  transactions in which the shareholders of such third party immediately 
prior to the consummation of such transaction will own more than 15% of the 
outstanding Company Common Stock immediately following such transaction, or 
(F) without limiting any of the foregoing, any of the foregoing types of 
transactions involving the acquisition of greater than 49% of the voting
equity  interests in any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company with
assets, revenue  or earnings representing 15% or more of the consolidated
assets, revenue or  earnings of the Company on a consolidated basis.

 



 

" _Superior  Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal or offer to
acquire,  directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash 
and/or publicly listed and traded securities, more than two-thirds of the 
equity securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets 
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a  third
party, and which is otherwise on terms and conditions which the  Company's
Board of Directors determines in its good faith and reasonable  judgment and
by resolution duly adopted (after consultation with a  financial advisor of
national reputation and in light of all relevant  circumstances, including
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and  this Agreement and the
timing and certainty of consummation) to be more  favorable to the Company's
shareholders than the terms set forth in this  Agreement or the terms of any
other proposal made by Parent after Parent's  receipt of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice, and which the Company's  Board of Directors determines
in good faith is reasonably capable of being  consummated on the terms so
proposed and determines (after receiving  the advice of its outside counsel)
in good faith by resolution duly adopted  that it is reasonably necessary to
withdraw or modify the Company Board  Recommendation in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to  the shareholders of the Company under applicable
Law, taking into account  such matters as the Company's Board of Directors
deems relevant to its decision,  including but not limited to, any financing
and approval requirements,  timing of such consummation and all financial,
regulatory, legal and other  aspects of such proposal.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company's
Board of  Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company's
shareholders  a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other 
applicable Law, if the Company's Board of Directors determines, after 
consultation with outside counsel, that there is a reasonable likelihood 
failure to so disclose such position would constitute a violation  of
applicable Law. In addition, it is understood and agreed  that, for purposes
of this Agreement (including Article VIII), (i) a  factually accurate public
statement by the Company that merely describes  the Company's receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this  Agreement with respect
thereto shall not be deemed a withdrawal or  modification, or proposal by the
Company's Board of Directors to withdraw  or modify, the Company's Board of
Directors' recommendation of this  Agreement or the Transactions, or an
approval or recommendation  with respect to such Alternative Proposal and
(ii) any "stop, look and  listen" communication by the Company's Board of
Directors to the shareholders of  the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act or any  similar communication to the shareholders shall not
constitute a Company  Adverse Recommendation Change provided that, in no
event will the Company,  the Company's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof (A) recommend that the  shareholders of the Company tender their
shares in connection with any such  tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve or recommend any Alternative  Proposal) or (B) withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation, in  each case other than in accordance with
Section 6.3(c).

 



 

**Section  6.4 _Reasonable Best  Efforts._**

 



 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto  shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall
cause their  respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to  (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done,  all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions
to  Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate
and  make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,  the
Transactions, including using its reasonable efforts to prepare and  file
promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, 
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, 
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended 
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws) and (ii) obtain all approvals, 
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations 
from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or 
advisable to consummate the Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust
Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,  as amended, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and  all other
applicable Laws issued by a foreign, United States or federal  Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict  or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or  restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or  acquisition.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement, the " _reasonable best efforts_ " of Parent
or  Merger Sub shall not include acceptance by Parent or Merger Sub of any or
all  divestitures of any subsidiary or assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of  their  Affiliates or acceptance of an agreement to hold any assets of
the business  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries separate in any lawsuit
or other legal  proceeding, whether judicial or administrative and whether
required by the  FTC,  the Antitrust Division or any other applicable U.S.
or foreign Governmental  Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  or  any other agreement contemplated hereby
to the extent such action would  reasonably be expected to deprive Parent or
Merger Sub of a material benefit  or  benefits of the Transactions.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto  agrees use its reasonable best efforts to make an appropriate filing
of a  Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the  Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten 
business days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as  practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be  requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to  take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this  Section 6.4
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of  the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions  thereof) as soon as
practicable and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each  use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure  that no state
takeover, "moratorium," "fair price," "affiliate  transaction" or similar
statute or regulation under any applicable Law is  or becomes applicable to
any of the Transactions and (y) if any state  takeover, "moratorium," "fair
price," "affiliate transaction" or similar  statute or regulation under any
applicable Law becomes applicable to any of  the Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions  may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by  this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the  Transactions.

 



 

(c) Each  of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i)  cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or  submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the 
Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by  or
before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including  any
proceeding initiated by a private party and (ii) keep the other party 
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any 
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party 
to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department 
of Justice or any other Governmental Authority and of any material 
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a 
private party, in each case regarding any of the  Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange  of information, each of the parties
hereto shall have the right to review  in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on,  all the information relating to
the other parties and their respective  Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
that appears in any filing made with, or  written materials submitted to, any
third party and/or any Governmental  Authority in connection with the
Transactions. Each party shall  have the right to attend conferences and
meetings between the other party  and regulators concerning the Transactions,
unless objection is raised by  the Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything in this  Agreement to the contrary, nothing in the Agreement shall
require Parent or  Merger Sub to provide to the Company any or any access to
non-public  information about Parent and its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in this Section 6.4, each of the parties hereto shall use  its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be 
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the 
Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the 
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry 
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that 
would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, on  or
before the Walk-Away Date, including by defending through  litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and  (ii) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law  that may be

the foregoing  confidentiality obligations and the Company and Parent shall

(i) the  Offer or Company Shareholder Approval has not been consummated or
obtained  on or  before the date that is four months after the date of this
Agreement (the " _Walk-_ _Away Date_ "); provided, however, that the right
to  terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not  be
available to a party if the failure of the Offer to have  been consummated on

party to perform any of its obligations under  this Agreement and provided,
further, that Parent may unilaterally extend,  by notice delivered to the
Company on or prior to the original Walk-Away Date,  the Walk-Away Date for
one month after the date above, in which case the  Walk-Away Date shall be
deemed to be for all purposes to be such  date;

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this 
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise to the 
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Annex I and (y) cannot be 
cured by the Company by the Walk-Away Date or, if curable, is not cured 
within 45 days after the Company receives written notice from Parent of  such

Termination Fee shall be paid concurrently with such termination,  payable by
wire transfer of same-day funds.

 



 

(b) In  the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent either pursuant
to (i)  Section 8.1(c)(i) based on a willful breach by the Company of its

Section 8.3 together with interest on the amount of the Termination  Fee from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of  payment at
the prime rate of SunTrust Bank in effect on the date such payment  was
required to be made. Solely for the purposes of  Section 8.3(c) and 8.3(d),
the term "Alternative Proposal" shall have the  meaning assigned to such term
in Section 6.3(d), except that  all references to "15%" shall be changed to
"35%".

Agreement, any and all remedies expressly  conferred upon a party to this
Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not  exclusive of, any other remedy

party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set 
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such  party.

Agreement,  including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the exhibits hereto,

paragraph (a) above;  or

 



 

(c) (i)  any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained

minimis respects as  of  such specified date), (ii) any of the
representations and warranties of the  Company contained in Sections 4.3 and
4.16, disregarding any materiality or  Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained in any such  representation or warranty, shall not
be true in all material respects when  made  or at any time prior to the
consummation of the Offer as if made at and as  of  such time (other than
any such representation or warranty that is made only  as  of a specified

would reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect;
_provided further_ that in determining whether a  Company Material Adverse
Effect would result, any inaccuracies in the  representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 4.3(c)(ii)(y) and  4.3(c)(ii)(z) that would cause an
adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause  (iii) of the definition of
Company Material Adverse Effect shall be taken into  account; or


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55
