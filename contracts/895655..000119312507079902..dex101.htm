become final and binding on the Parties on the date the Arbitrating Accountant delivers its final resolution in writing to the Parties (which final resolution shall be requested by the Parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45)&nbsp;days

of each Party in the Business EBITDA dispute in the manner described in the following sentence; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Seller shall advance half, and Buyer shall advance the other half, of any retainer fee or deposit required by the
Arbitrating Accountant in advance of a final resolution, subject to reapportionment by the Arbitrating Accountant of its fees and expenses as aforesaid. For example, if the final determination reflected a 60-40 compromise of the Parties&#146;
