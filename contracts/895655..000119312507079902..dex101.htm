2.2. _Earn-Out_.

(a) Seller shall receive, as additional purchase price the following payments,
if any, determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Section 2.2 (collectively, "Additional Purchase Price Payments") and the
Business EBITDA Benchmarks set forth below, without duplication (the "Business
EBITDA Benchmarks"):

(i) If the Business EBITDA is greater than or equal to $50,000,000 in any
calendar year following the Closing from and including calendar year 2007 to
and including calendar year 2009, Buyer shall pay to Seller a one time payment
of $25,000,000;

(ii) If the Business EBITDA is greater than or equal to $55,000,000, in any
calendar year following the Closing from and including calendar year 2007 to
 



 

2  and including calendar year 2009, Buyer shall pay to Seller a one time
payment of an aggregate of $40,000,000, less any amounts previously paid to
Seller under Section 2.2(a)(i);

(iii) If the Business EBITDA is greater than or equal to $59,000,000, in any
calendar year following the Closing from and including calendar year 2007 to
and including calendar year 2009, Buyer shall pay to Seller a one time payment
of an aggregate of $50,000,000, less any amounts previously paid to Seller
under Sections 2.2(a)(i) and (ii); and

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Business EBITDA is less
than $59,000,000 in each calendar year following the Closing from and
including calendar year 2007 to and including calendar year 2009 but is
greater than or equal to $59,000,000 in calendar year 2010, Buyer shall pay to
Seller a one time payment of $10,000,000, less any amounts previously paid to
Seller under Sections 2.2(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) in excess of $40,000,000.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree that Seller shall be
entitled to receive no more than $50,000,000 under any circumstances under
this Section 2.2. The Business EBITDA Benchmarks may be adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.2(g) and Section 2.2(h)(ii) below.

(b) On or before March 31st of each of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, Buyer shall
(i) provide a statement of the Business EBITDA for the preceding calendar year
derived from Buyers audited consolidated Financial Statements, which Buyers
audited consolidated Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, and Buyers calculation of the Additional Purchase Price Payments,
if any (collectively the "Earn-Out Statement"), and (ii) deliver the Earn-Out
Statement to Seller; _provided_ that such statements shall cease to be
required following aggregate Additional Purchase Price Payments of
$50,000,000. For up to ninety- (90) days immediately following Sellers
receipt of an Earn-Out Statement (the "Receipt Date"), Seller shall be
permitted to review the working papers and Books and Records of the Business
and shall be permitted to discuss such matters with the chief financial
officer and other executive officers of Buyer, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and with Buyers, the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries accountants for the purpose of confirming the determination of
the applicable calendar years Business EBITDA. The determination of the
Business EBITDA and the calculation of any Additional Purchase Price Payments
included in an Earn-Out Statement shall become final and binding upon the
Parties ninety (90) days following Receipt Date, unless Seller gives written
notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement Regarding Additional
Purchase Price Payments") to Buyer prior to such date (the period commencing
on the Receipt Date and ending on the earlier of (i) ninety (90) days
thereafter and (ii) the date a Notice of Disagreement Regarding Additional
Purchase Price Payments is given, the "Earn-Out Review Period"). For up to
fifteen (15) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement Regarding
Additional Purchase Price Payments (the "Negotiation Period"), the Parties
shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement Regarding
Additional Purchase Price Payments. Following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement Regarding Additional Purchase Price Payments, Buyer and its
agents and representatives shall be permitted to review Sellers and its
representatives working papers relating to its calculation of Business
EBITDA and the Earn-Out  



 

3  Statement. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon the determination of the
Business EBITDA for such calendar year and the amount of any Additional
Purchase Price Payments within the Negotiation Period, the Parties shall
submit to the Arbitrating Accountant for review and resolution all matters
(but only such matters) that remain in dispute and that were included in the
Notice of Disagreement Regarding Additional Purchase Price Payments. The
Parties shall instruct the Arbitrating Accountant to make a final
determination of such calendar years Business EBITDA and the Additional
Purchase Price Payments calculation. Such determination shall become final
and binding on the Parties on the date the Arbitrating Accountant delivers its
final resolution in writing to the Parties (which final resolution shall be
requested by the Parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45)
days following submission of such disputed matters). In rendering its
decision, the Arbitrating Accountant shall apportion its fees and expenses in
connection with the Business EBITDA dispute, based on its views as to the
relative merits of the positions of each Party in the Business EBITDA dispute
in the manner described in the following sentence; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall advance half, and Buyer shall advance the other half, of any
retainer fee or deposit required by the Arbitrating Accountant in advance of
a final resolution, subject to reapportionment by the Arbitrating Accountant
of its fees and expenses as aforesaid. For example, if the final determination
reflected a 60-40 compromise of the Parties claims, the Arbitrating
Accountant would allocate expenses 40% to the Party whose claims determined to
be 60% successful and 60% to the Party whose claim was determined to be 40%
successful. All determinations of the Arbitrating Accountant, including any
revisions made to the calculation of Business EBITDA for any year in the Earn-
Out Statements and the Arbitrating Accountants apportionment of expenses as
between Seller and Buyer, shall be final and binding on the Parties
hereto, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have the right to appeal such
determinations. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith with each
other and with the Arbitrating Accountant in order to facilitate the receipt
of the final determinations of the Arbitrating Accountant.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of the Earn-Out
Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of the Additional Purchase
Price Payments, if any, shown to be due on the Earn-Out Statement (an
"Undisputed Amount"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller in writing. In the event a Notice of
Disagreement Regarding Additional Purchase Price Payments is given or the
Arbitrating Accountant determines that Additional Purchase Price Payments are
due to Seller, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the final
and binding Additional Purchase Price Payments and the Undisputed Amount, if
any, that has previously been paid to Seller (plus interest at a rate of (i)
8% per annum on such amount from the date that is five (5) Business Days after
the end of the Earn-Out Review Period through the end of the Negotiation
Period and (ii) 10% per annum following the expiration of the Negotiation
Period through the date that such payment is made by Buyer to Seller) within
three (3) Business Days after the date the calculation of the Additional
Purchase Price Payments becomes final and binding on the Parties, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in
writing by Seller. Any payments to Seller which are not made by Buyer within
the time periods required by this Section 2.2(c) shall bear interest at a rate
of (A) 20% per annum, or, if such amount is not permissible under applicable
Law, (B) the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from
time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the Laws which
are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such
applicable Laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher
maximum non-usurious interest rate than applicable Laws now allow.



 

4 (d) During the Earn-Out Period, Buyer shall cause the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Business to be operated and managed in a manner
consistent with reasonable business practices and in accordance with the
principles and agreements set forth on Annex I hereto and incorporated herein
by reference.

(e) Buyer will furnish Seller with reasonable promptness:

(i) promptly after becoming available, and in any event within forty-five (45)
days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal
year, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal quarter and the related statement of
income and statement of cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for such fiscal quarter and for the period from the beginning of the
then current fiscal year to the end of such fiscal quarter, setting forth in
each case in comparative form the corresponding figures (A) for the
corresponding periods of the previous fiscal year (B) contained in the annual
budget for such fiscal quarter;

(ii) promptly after becoming available, and in any event within ninety (90)
days after the end of each fiscal year, the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal year and
the related statement of income and statement of cash flows of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for such fiscal year, setting forth in each case in
comparative form the corresponding figures (A) for the previous fiscal year,
in each case (except for the pre-acquisition periods) derived from the Buyers
audited consolidated Financial Statements, which Buyers audited consolidated
Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, certified by
an independent certified public accounting firm and (B) contained in the
annual budget for such fiscal year;

(iii) and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after discovery of
any breach or other noncompliance by Buyer, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (the "Buyer Group") of any covenant or obligation contained in
Section 2.2(f) below, written notice of such event, which shall include a
reasonable description thereof and Buyers proposed response or course of
action to be taken with respect thereto;

(iv) and in no event less than ten (10) Business Days prior notice, written
notice of a Change of Control; _provided_ that Seller agrees to sign
confidentiality agreements on commercial terms that are reasonably acceptable
to Buyer;

(v) promptly after being submitted to its lenders, any management discussion
and analysis section included in any communications, financial reports or
materials provided by Buyer to its lenders that relate primarily to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; and



 

5 (vi) within ten (10) days following the presentation of the annual budget
presented to the board of directors of Buyer, but in any event no later than
December 31 of each year, the annual budget of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including a breakdown of such annual budget on a quarterly basis
when available), including any written commentary thereon and any subsequent
revisions or amendments thereto promptly upon approval thereof, redacted to
remove such items and information that do not relate primarily to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary. 

(f) From and after the Closing until such time as no further Additional
Purchase Price Payments are capable of being earned by Seller under this
Section 2.2, none of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and Buyer
shall not cause or allow any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
take (or agree to take) any of the actions enumerated below without obtaining
the prior written consent of Seller:

(i) effect a Change of Control or enter into any transaction that
would result in a Change of Control unless the requirements in Section
2.2(h)(i) are met;

(ii) enter into, modify or amend any transaction, agreement or other
arrangement by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, with
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, other than (A) on an arms-
length basis or (B) on terms that are more favorable to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries than those that would be obtained on an arms-length
basis; or

(iii) pursue any business opportunity that is not reasonably related to the
operation of the Business.

(g) From and after the Closing until such time as no further Additional
Purchase Price Payments are capable of being earned by Seller under this
Section 2.2, if the Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer intends to acquire by
merger, recapitalization, consolidation, stock purchase, asset purchase or
otherwise (an "Acquisition") a Related Business, Buyer shall give Seller ten
(10) Business Days advance written notice prior to completing transaction
("Related Business Notice"), which notice shall include specific information
as to the financial condition and operations of such Related Business;
_provided_ that if Buyer or such Buyer Affiliate is prohibited from providing
advance notice of pursuit of such Related Business due to confidentiality
requirements, then Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer shall provide notice as
soon as is reasonably practicable and in any case upon acquisition or
commencement of such Related Business. Seller shall have twenty (20) Business
Days following receipt of the Related Business Notice (the "Review Period")
to review all of the information related to the Related Business, and Buyer
shall provide to Seller any additional information reasonably requested by
Seller promptly following such requests in order for Seller to complete its
review of the Related Business. Prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
Seller shall notify (such notice, an "Election Notice") Buyer if Seller wishes
to discuss transferring the Related Business to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. If Seller elects to discuss transfer of the Related Business to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith the terms of such transfer within thirty (30) days thereafter
(the "Transfer Period"). If Buyer and Seller agree on the terms and conditions
of such transfer, then (A) the Related Business shall be transferred to  



 

6  the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary (B) the Business EBITDA
Benchmarks shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer, (C) any
income earned as a result of the operation of such Related Business shall be
included in Net Income for purposes of calculating Business EBITDA and (D) any
expense of such Related Business shall be included in the calculation
of Business EBITDA, excluding all costs and expenses associated with the
acquisition of such Related Business and any attorneys, accountants and
other professional fees relating to such acquisition. If Seller does not
deliver an Election Notice, decides it does not want the Related Business to
be transferred to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or, if Seller and
Buyer do not reach agreement on the terms of the transfer during the Transfer
Period, then (X) such Related Business shall be considered an "Excluded
Acquisition" and shall be held separately from the Business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, (Y) any income earned as a result of the operation

6.1. _Tax Covenants_.

(a) _Post-Closing Actions_. Buyer shall not permit the Company to take
any action on the Closing Date that could increase any Sellers liability for
Taxes (including any liability of Seller to indemnify Buyer for certain Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement) and neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall
(or shall cause or permit the Company to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify
any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company, with respect to
any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, without
the prior written permission of Seller, which permission Seller may not
unreasonably withhold or delay. An amount equal to all refunds (whether
received in the form of cash or applied as a credit to future Taxes or
otherwise) with respect to Taxes (including refunds arising by reason of
amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date that relate to the pre-
closing period or otherwise) liability for which Seller indemnifies Buyer and
the Company pursuant to this Agreement, actually received by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company) shall be available to Seller as an
offset to indemnification payments owed by Seller or the Members pursuant to
Section 7.3.

(b) _Cooperation and Records Retention_. Seller and Buyer shall: (i) each
provide the other, and Buyer shall cause the Company to provide Seller, with
such assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of them in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or other examination by any
taxing authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liability for Taxes; (ii) each retain and provide the other, and Buyer shall
cause the Company to retain and provide Seller with, any records or other
information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination,
proceeding, or determination; and (iii) each provide the other with any final
determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding, or determination
that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other or
the Company for any period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall retain, and shall cause the Company to retain, and Seller shall
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules, and other records or information that may be relevant to such
returns for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records
without first providing the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and copy the same. Each Party shall bear its own expenses in complying
with the provisions of this Section 6.1(b).



 

29 (c) _Tax Contests_. Seller shall control, at its expense, the handling,
disposition, and settlement of any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes for
which indemnification would be owed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section
7.3(d). Seller shall not settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of any such
Tax Contest if such disposition would adversely affect the Companys or
Buyers Liability for any amount against which Seller does not indemnify the
Company and Buyer, without the prior written consent of Buyer which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. To the extent a Tax Contest
affects the liabilities of both Seller and either Buyer or the Company, the
handling, disposition and settlement of such a Tax Contest shall be controlled
jointly by Seller and Buyer, with expenses thereof to be shared in proportion
to the effect of the settlement or outcome of the Tax Contest on the
liabilities of Seller and Buyer. To the extent this Section 6.1(c) conflicts
with Section 7.5 herein (regarding Indemnification Procedures), this Section
6.1(c) shall govern.

(d) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid when due one half by Buyer and one half by Seller.
Each Party will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes.

(e) _Section 83(b) Elections_. Buyer agrees that if any employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary failed to make an election under section
83(b) of the Code with respect to a grant of equity securities of Seller to
such Person, Buyer shall cause the Company and/or any applicable Company
Subsidiary to make any initial tax filing in a manner consistent with the
position that Rev. Proc. 93-27 and Rev. Proc. 2001-43 apply to such grant
and no withholding Tax arises upon the vesting of the equity granted.

6.2. _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further actions are
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall take such further actions (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party may
reasonably request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article VII below). Seller acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing Buyer will be entitled to possession of all documents, books and
records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial data of any sort
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

6.3. _Litigation Support_.

(a) In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, each of the other Parties
shall reasonably cooperate with him, her, or it and his, her, or its counsel
in the contest or defense, make available his, her, or its personnel, and
provide such testimony and access to his, her, or its books and records as
shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole
cost and expense of the contesting or  



 

30  defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefore under Article VII below in which case such
expenses shall be payable as provided in Article VII below).

(b) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing, Buyer shall
permit Seller and its representatives and advisors (collectively, the "Seller
Parties") to have reasonable access during normal business hours, upon three
(3) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer, to the books, records
and personnel relating to the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required in
connection with (i) the preparation of any Sellers Tax Returns or with any
audit thereof, or (ii) any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation
relating to the operation of the Business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to the Closing.

6.4. _Confidentiality; Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation_. For purposes of this
Section 6.4, the Restricted Parties shall be Parties to this Agreement.

(a) _Confidentiality_. Seller, Whitney and the Members shall not, directly or
indirectly, disclose or use at any time (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to not use or disclose) any Confidential Information (as defined
below) (whether or not such information is or was developed by Seller, Whitney
or any of the Members), except to the extent that such disclosure or use
is directly related to and required by the performance of Sellers duties to
Buyer or as required by Law or as otherwise provided hereunder. Seller,
Whitney and the Members further agree to take commercially reasonable steps,
to the extent within their control to safeguard such Confidential Information
and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. In
the event Seller, Whitney and the Members are required by Law to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller, Whitney or any of the Members shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing, which notification shall include the nature
of the legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall
cooperate with Buyers reasonable requests to preserve the confidentiality of
such information consistent with applicable Law. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all information of a confidential
or proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as
"confidential"), in any form or medium, that relates to the business,
products, services or research or development of the Business or its
suppliers, distributors, customers, independent contractors or other business
relations. Confidential Information includes the following as they relate to
the Business and, in each case, to the extent the Company or any Company
Subsidiary obtains a commercial benefit from the secret nature of such
information: internal business information (including information relating to
strategic and staffing plans and practices, business, training, marketing,
promotional and sales plans and practices, cost, rate and pricing structures,
accounting and business methods and potential acquisition candidates);
identities of, individual requirements of, and specific contractual
arrangements with, the Businesss suppliers, distributors, customers,
independent contractors or other business relations and their confidential
information; trade secrets, know-how, compilations of data and analyses,
techniques, systems, formulae, research, records, reports, manuals,
documentation, models, data and data bases relating thereto; and inventions,
innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses,
drawings, and reports. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information
will not include such information which: (A) at the time of disclosure is
publicly available or thereafter becomes publicly available through no act or
omission of Seller, Whitney or the Members; (B) is thereafter  



 

31  disclosed or furnished to Seller or the Members by a third party who is not
known by Seller, Whitney or the Members to have acquired the information under
an obligation of confidentiality; (C) is independently developed by Seller,
Whitney or the Members without the use of or reference to Confidential
Information after the Closing Date; or (D) is disclosed by Seller, Whitney or
the Members (subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of this
subsection (a)) under compulsion of applicable Law.

(b) Each of Seller, Whitney, and the Members acknowledges that it is familiar
with the trade secrets related to the Business and with other Confidential
Information concerning the Business, including all (i) inventions, technology
and research and development related to the Business, (ii) customers and
clients and customer and client lists related to the Business, (iii) products
(including products under development) and services related to the Business
and related costs and pricing structures and manufacturing techniques, (iv)
accounting and business methods and practices related to the Business and (v)
similar and related confidential information and trade secrets related to the
Business. Each of Seller, Whitney and the Members acknowledges and agrees
that the Business would be irreparably damaged if any of Seller, Whitney or
the Members were to directly or indirectly provide services to any Person
competing with the Business or engaging in a similar business and that such
direct or indirect competition by any of Seller, Whitney or the Members would
result in a significant loss of goodwill by the Business.

(c) In further consideration for the payment of consideration directly to
Seller under this Agreement, and in order to protect the value of the Business
acquired by Buyer hereunder (including the goodwill inherent in the Business
as of the date hereof), each Restricted Party (as defined in Article VIII)
hereby agrees that during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-
Compete Period"), such Restricted Party shall not have any Affiliation (as
defined in Article VIII) with any entity, enterprise or other Person (other
than Seller) having any location in any country in which the Business
currently operates which entity, enterprise or other Person primarily engages
in, or engages in the management or operation of any Person that primarily
engages in any business that competes with the Business; _provided_ that
nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any Restricted Party
from purchasing up to an aggregate of 5% of any class of the outstanding
voting securities of any other Person whose securities are listed on a
national securities exchange (but only if such investment is held on a purely
passive basis).

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Solicitation Period"), none
of the Restricted Parties shall directly or indirectly, either individually or
acting in concert with another Person or Persons:

(i) request, induce or attempt to influence any distributor, supplier or
customer of goods or services of the Business to curtail, cancel or refrain
from maintaining or increasing the amount or type of business such
distributor, supplier or customer of goods or services is currently
transacting, or may be transacting during the Non-Solicitation Period, with
the Business or modify its pricing or other terms of sale with the Business;



 

32 (ii) solicit for employment or retention or hire, employ or retain any person
who is an employee of the Business during the Non-Solicitation Period
(provided that following the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, any
Restricted Party and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to hire,
employ or retain any such Person so long as such Restricted Party did not
directly or indirectly solicit such Person, other than through general
advertisements not intended specifically directed at such person (for the
avoidance of doubt, the Restricted Parties shall not be deemed to have
violated this provision by hiring, employing or retaining any Person who
contacts a Restricted Party on an unsolicited basis following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date);

(iii) influence or attempt to influence any Person who is an employee of the
Business during the Non-Solicitation Period to terminate his or her
employment with Buyer (For purpose of clarity, if any Restricted Party
exercises its right to hire in accordance with the terms of the proviso set
forth in subsection (ii) above, such action shall not be deemed to be a
violation of this subsection (iii)); or

(iv) make any negative, derogatory or disparaging statements or communications
regarding the Buyer, the Business or their respective Affiliates or
employees; provided that Buyer agrees that it shall not and it shall prohibit
its Subsidiaries from making any negative, derogatory or disparaging
statements or communication regarding any Restricted Party.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any
time, in any judicial or arbitration proceeding, any of the restrictions
stated in this Agreement is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable under
circumstances then existing, the Parties each agree that the period, scope or
geographical area, as the case may be, shall be reduced to the extent
necessary to enable the court to enforce the restrictions to the extent such
provisions are allowable under applicable law, giving effect to the agreement
and intent of the Parties that the restrictions contained herein shall be
effective to the fullest extent permissible. In the event of a breach or
violation by any Restricted Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
the Non-Compete Period or Non-Solicitation Period, as the case may be, will
be tolled for so long as such Restricted Party was in violation of such
provision. Each Restricted Party agrees that the restrictions contained in
this Agreement are reasonable in all respects and necessary to protect
Buyers interest in and the value of the Business.

(f) Each Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a
breach by any Restricted Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in
the event of any such breach, Buyer or its successors or assigns may, in
addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any
court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or
injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of
the provisions hereof, in each case without the requirement of posting a bond
or proving actual damages.

which would remove, limit or impair the provisions providing for the
indemnification and exculpation of directors and officers contained therein.

Company Subsidiaries to so indemnify the directors and officers of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (including Persons who were the directors

(B), (C) and (D) hereof shall be collectively referred to herein as the
"Fundamental Representations". All Post-Closing Covenants of Seller and the
Company will survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.

7.2. _Survival of Buyer s Representations and Warranties; Time Limits on
Indemnification Obligations_. All of the representations and warranties of
Buyer contained in, or arising out of, this Agreement shall survive the
Closing hereunder until April 6, 2008; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party") harmless from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, deficiencies, demands, claims, suits, actions,
or causes of action, assessments, losses, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) (hereinafter, a "Loss" or the "Losses") sustained
or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party resulting from:



 

36 (a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company in Article
III or Seller in Article IV of this Agreement (in each case disregarding, for
purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach thereof and the amount of
Losses relating thereto, any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect contained in any such representation or warranty other than
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.8(c) and Section
3.9); _provided_ , _however_ , that such Buyer Indemnified Party shall have
asserted its claim for indemnification in writing prior to the expiration of
any applicable survival period specified in Section 7.1;

(b) any withholding Taxes payable as a result of the vesting of any Equity
Securities of Seller in the hands of any current or former employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary;

(c) any breach of a Post-Closing Covenant made by Seller in this Agreement; or

(d) liability for any Pre-January 1, 2006 Taxes.

_provided_ _that_ no indemnification payment shall be made to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties by Seller and/or Members under Sections 7.3(a) until the
amounts that the Buyer Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled
to receive under this Agreement aggregate at least $2,000,000
("Indemnification Threshold"), it being understood and agreed that at such
time as Losses exceed the Indemnification Threshold, Seller and Members shall
be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for the entire amount
of such Losses without regard to the Indemnification Threshold; and _provided_
_further_ that Seller and Members shall not have any aggregate liability
under Section 7.3(a) in excess of $60,000,000 (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Indemnification Threshold nor the Cap shall apply
to (i) any claim for breach of Fundamental Representations (other than the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.29), (ii) any claim for
Losses resulting from any Pre-January 1, 2006 Taxes or (iii) any claim
resulting from a breach of the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 3.29(a) if such breach relates to Indebtedness for borrowed money. All
indemnification payments under this Section 7.3 shall be deemed adjustments to
the Purchase Price set forth in Section 1.2 above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any payment owed pursuant to Section 7.3 shall be reduced as
provided in Section 6.1(a). Nothing in this Agreement (including this Section
7.3) shall limit or restrict any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties rights to
maintain or recover any amounts at any time in connection with any action or
claim based upon fraud or deceit made by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.

7.4. _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and save Seller and the Members ("Seller Indemnified
Party") harmless from and against any and all Losses sustained or incurred by
Seller Indemnified Party resulting from:

(a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article V (in
each case disregarding, for purposes of determining the inaccuracy or breach
thereof and the amount of Losses relating thereto, any qualification as
to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in any such
representation or warranty); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller
Indemnified Party shall have asserted its claim for indemnification in writing
with reasonable supporting details promptly upon discovering any such breach,
and in any event, before the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in Section 7.2; or



 

37 (b) any breach of a Post-Closing Covenant made by Buyer, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in this Agreement.

7.5. _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. Subject to Section 6.3(a), in the event that
subsequent to the Closing, any Person that is or may be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice
of the assertion of any claim, issuance of any order or the commencement of
any action or proceeding by any Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a
Party, including, any domestic or foreign court or Governmental Authority (a
"Third Party Claim"), against such Indemnified Party and for which a Party is
or may be required to provide indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified Party shall give written notice
thereof, together with a statement of any available information regarding such
claim, to such Indemnifying Party within ten (10) days after learning of such
claim (but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense
of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnifying Partys failure to give such
notice). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right upon written notice to
the Indemnified Party (the "Defense Notice"), within thirty (30) days after
receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, to conduct, at
its expense, and with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, the defense against such claim in its own name, or if necessary in the
name of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a
party to such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim and provide
indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party does elect to conduct the defense of the subject claim, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying
Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in
the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, provided that the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to compromise and settle the claim only
with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend
against such claim, unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of Legal Requirements, and (ii) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (c) the
Indemnifying Party will have no liability or future additional expense with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its
consent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may
adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for which it
would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party and at its own  



 

38  expense, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such
Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by
any determination of a Third Party Claim so defended or any compromise or
settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld).

(b) _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought.

7.6. _Payment of Claims_. With regard to any and all claims for which
indemnification is payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Party upon the earliest to occur of (i) the entry of a
judgment against the Indemnified Party and the expiration of any applicable
appeal period, or if earlier, five (5) Business Days prior to the date that
the judgment creditor has the right to execute the judgment, (ii) the entry
of an unappealable judgment or final appellate decision against the
Indemnified Party or (iii) a settlement of the claim. The earliest to occur of
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above is referred to herein as a "Final
Determination". All indemnification amounts shall be paid promptly by the
Indemnifying Party upon demand by the Indemnified Party following Final
Determination;  _provided_ that Seller (or any Member to the extent that such
