ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER 

  

 Section 1.01 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) _Commencement of the Offer_. _Provided_ that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten Business Days) after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), the Offer at the Offer Price, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 1.01(a)_ if the Company fails to comply with its obligations under _Section 1.02_. 

   

 (b) _Conditions of Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer is subject to the terms and the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_ below) of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the "Tender Offer Conditions"). On the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer and in compliance with applicable Law (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Time"). Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely basis funds necessary to purchase and pay for any and all shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; (ii) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to or sought to be purchased in the Offer; (iii) impose conditions on the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions or amend any condition in a manner adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock; (iv) waive or amend the Minimum Condition; (v) amend any other term of the Offer in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company Shareholders; or (vi) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date except as required or permitted by _Section 1.01(e)_. 

   

 (d) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall include 

      ##### 

  

    

an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and other
required ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders in accordance with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Subject to _Section 6.03_,
the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Company Board Recommendation. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, cause the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the applicable Laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents sufficiently in
advance of its filing with the SEC (including any amendments or supplements
thereto), and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments
on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given). The Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable efforts to respond
promptly to any such comments. 

   

 (e) _Expiration of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th) business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.01(e)_ calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is commenced (the "Initial Expiration Date") or, if the period of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 1.01(e)_ or as may be required by applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in accordance with this _Section 1.01(e)_, the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived, Merger Sub may extend the Offer for successive extension periods of not more than five (5) business days (or for such longer period as the parties may agree) each in order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer, (ii) if, on the Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived and there has not been a Change in the Company Recommendation then, to the extent requested in writing by the Company no less than one (1) business day prior to the Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for up to five (5) business days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) per extension until such condition(s) has been satisfied or waived; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond March 31, 2011 (the "Termination Date"); 

     ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , _further_ , that if the only Tender Offer Condition which has
not been satisfied as of the Termination Date is the Regulatory Condition,
the Termination Date shall be April 30, 2011, and (iii) Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or
its staff applicable to the Offer or necessary to resolve any comments of the
SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents. Nothing
in this _Section 1.01(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ hereof. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of
Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company Common Stock
to the registered holders thereof. 

   

 (f) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If necessary to obtain sufficient shares of Company Common Stock to reach the Short Form Threshold (without regard to shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee and without regard to the Top-Up Option), Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) after the Acceptance Time in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a "Subsequent Offering Period"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such Subsequent Offering Period. The Offer Documents shall provide for the possibility of a Subsequent Offering Period in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 1.01(f)_. 

   

 Section 1.02 _Company Action_. (a) On or as promptly as practicable after the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to _Section 6.03_, contains the Company Board Recommendation and shall promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the Company Shareholders together with the Offer Documents as required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Except in connection with (i) an Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal or (ii) a Change in the Company Recommendation: (A) Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the 

     ##### 

  

    

Schedule 14D-9 sufficiently in advance of its filing with the SEC (including
any amendments or supplements thereto), and the Company shall give reasonable
and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and
its counsel; and (B) the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of the Company to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given). The Company shall use reasonable efforts to respond promptly
to any such comments. 

   

 (c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement provide to Parent, or cause to be provided to Parent, (i) a list of the Companys shareholders as well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case true and complete as of the most recent practicable date and shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance (including updated lists of the Company Shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the Company Shareholders. Except as required by applicable Law, and except as necessary to communicate regarding the Transactions with the Company Shareholders, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the Transactions, and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their Representatives. 

   

 Section 1.03 _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and/or Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to purchase from the Company at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer, up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, would constitute one (1) share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (on a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of shares of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding plus all shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such date pursuant to options (whether or not then vested or exercisable), rights, convertible or exchangeable securities (only to the extent then convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock) or similar obligations then outstanding, after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) (the "Short Form Threshold"). Parent may assign the Top-Up Option and its rights and obligations pursuant to this _Section 1.03_, in its sole discretion, to any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised at any time after consummation of the Offer and prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock and shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company available for issuance, (ii) any Restraint or Law shall prohibit the exercise or delivery of the Top-Up Option, (iii) immediately after such exercise and issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would not be reached or (iv) Merger Sub has not accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer (or during any subsequent offering period) and not validly withdrawn. 

   

 (c) In the event that Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or will be owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub immediately following the Acceptance Time and specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Parent or Merger Sub specifying the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (y) the Offer Price, which amount may be paid, at the election of Parent or Merger Sub, either in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares, and (ii) the Company shall cause the Top-Up Option Shares to be issued to Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries designated by Parent) or Merger Sub, represented by either certificates or book-entry shares, at the sole option of Parent or Merger Sub. Any promissory note issued pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be on terms as provided by Parent or Merger Sub, which terms shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Prior to the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, upon Parents or Merger Subs request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent or Merger Sub the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent and/or Merger Sub acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares which Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act, and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and/or Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 1.04 _Board of Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the Acceptance Time and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as shall give Parent representation on the Companys Board of Directors equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Companys Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this  _Section 1.04_) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Company Common Stock then owned directly or indirectly by Parent bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. Prior to, and effective upon, the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon request by Parent, take all actions as are necessary to enable Parents designees to be so elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, including by promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Companys Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Companys Board of Directors (including by amending the by-laws of the Company if necessary to increase the size of the Companys Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as is necessary to provide Parent with such level of representation, and shall cause Parents designees to be so elected or appointed at such time (the date on which Parents designees are so elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, the "Director Appointment Date"). Subject to _Section 1.04(b)_, after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request, cause the directors elected or designated by Parent to the Companys Board of Directors to serve on and constitute the same percentage as such individuals represent of the entire Board of Directors of the Company (but not less than a majority) (rounded up to the next whole number) of: (i) each committee of the Companys Board of Directors and (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) and each committee thereof (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of the NYSE. The provisions of this _Section 1.04(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. The Companys obligations to appoint or elect Parents designees to the Companys Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. At the request of Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect any such appointment or election of Parents designees, including mailing to the Company Shareholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company, and be solely responsible for, all information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and affiliates as is required by such Section and Rule. 

   

 (b) After Parents designees are appointed or elected to, and constitute a majority of, the Companys Board of Directors pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Companys Board of Directors to maintain at least three directors who are members of the Companys Board of Directors on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the "Continuing Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate a 

     ##### 

  

    

person meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed
to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three
persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of
this Agreement. The Company and the Companys Board of Directors shall
promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations
under this _Section 1.04(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Companys Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to  _Section 1.04(a)_, the approval of a majority of such
Continuing Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only
one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend, modify
or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any
amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement, in any case on
behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any
of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement, (iii) waive or exercise any of the Companys rights under this
Agreement, (iv) waive any condition to the Companys obligations under this
Agreement, (v) amend the Company Charter Documents, (vi) authorize any
agreement between the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the other
hand, or (vii) make any other determination with respect to any action to be
taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions. For purposes of considering any matter set
forth in this _Section 1.04(b)_, the Continuing Directors shall be permitted
to meet without the presence of the other directors. The Continuing Directors
shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current
counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as
determined by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Companys rights hereunder.

 (i) each Company Stock Option for which, as of the Change in Control, the Offer Price exceeds the exercise price per Share shall be canceled immediately following the Change in Control and, in exchange therefor, the Company shall pay to each former holder of such Company Stock Option as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Change in Control, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per Share under such Company Stock Option and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; and 

   

 (ii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control for which, as of the Change in Control, the Offer Price does not exceed the exercise price per Share shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. 

  

 (b) Each Company RSU and Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control, whether or not then vested, shall become fully vested immediately prior to, and then shall be canceled at, the Change in Control (the "Canceled Restricted Awards"), and, in exchange therefor, the Company shall pay to each former holder of any such Canceled Restricted Awards, as soon as practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Change in Control, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (1) the Offer Price and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Canceled Restricted Awards. 

   

 (c) Each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control, whether or not then vested, shall vest as provided in (ii) below immediately prior to, 

     ##### 

  

    

and then shall be canceled in full at, the Change in Control, and, in exchange
therefor, the Company shall pay to each former holder of any such Company
PSUs, as soon as practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business
Days following the Change in Control, an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (1) the Offer Price and (2) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company PSUs that vest in accordance with this
subsection (c); notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent
and the Company shall cause all such payments with respect to Company PSUs to
be paid in a manner which complies with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in the event the Change in Control
occurs prior to the end of the relevant fiscal period, the number of Company
PSUs vesting pursuant to the prior sentence shall be based on a deemed
achievement of performance conditions at target level, and (ii) in the event
the Change in Control occurs or has occurred subsequent to the end of the
relevant fiscal period, the number of Company PSUs vesting pursuant to the
prior sentence shall be based on the level of such actual Company performance
as determined by the Company, in accordance with the applicable Company PSU
award agreement and applicable Company Stock Plan. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.09_, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Company Stock Plan as may be necessary and satisfying any requirement to notify the holders of Company Compensatory Awards as may be required under the Company Stock Plans. 

   

 (e) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this _Section 2.09_, the parties hereto agree that, following the Acceptance Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including, but not limited to, any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (f) To the extent the holder of any Company Compensatory Award is subject to taxation outside of the United States, any payments under this _Section 2.09_ shall be made in the jurisdiction and/or from the entity from which such individual is paid salary or wages in the normal course of business, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

   

 (g) For purposes of this _Section 2.09_, the term "Change in Control" shall have the meaning set forth in the Company Stock Plan applicable to each Company Stock Option, Company RSU, Company Restricted Stock Award, or Company PSU. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding the grant (other than any grants not made in accordance with this Agreement), exercise or settlement of any Company Compensatory Awards, then the 

     ##### 

  

    

Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change in
capitalization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.11 _Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Merger Sub shall own a number of shares of Company Common Stock that meets or exceeds the Short Form Threshold, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Acceptance Time without a Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBCA. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

 Section 3.01 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to receive, for the benefit of the Company Shareholders, funds representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to which Company Shareholders shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.08(a)_ (the "Exchange Fund") and for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Common Stock Certificates") or uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Shareholders for the purpose of holding the Common Stock Certificates and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented by such Certificates. Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds at or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 Section 3.02 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) at the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Common Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Common Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Common Stock Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) Each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Common Stock Certificate, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger 

    ##### 

  

    

Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding Tax), for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Common Stock Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof,
the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Common Stock Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Common Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred, in each case, as determined by the Exchange Agent and as set forth in the letter of transmittal and related instructions and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. 

   

 Section 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after Effective Time, any Common Stock Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article III. 

   

 Section 3.04 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited or otherwise made available to the Exchange Agent (including any proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled to under _Section 1.08_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar applicable Laws) for payment of the consideration in respect of such Company Common Stock without any interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a Governmental Authority or public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar applicable Laws. 

   

 Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person under 

     ##### 

  

    

this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Law.
If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

   

 Section 3.06 _Lost Certificates_. If any Common Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation or the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Common Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by _Section 1.08_. 

   

 Section 3.07 _No Further Ownership Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Common Stock Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 3.08 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), such Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with applicable Law, including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and none of such Company SEC Documents as of their respective filing dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

To the Knowledge of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, no Real Property Lease is subject to any Lien, including without limitation, any right to the use or occupancy of any Real Property (as defined below), other than Permitted Liens. Each Real Property Lease constitutes the entire agreement between the parties thereto with respect to the Real Property leased thereunder, and is, with respect to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, a valid and subsisting agreement in full force and effect and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include a material item of income in, or exclude a material item of deduction from, taxable 

    ##### 

  

    

income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing as
a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in

applicable Law) executed on or prior to the Closing; (iii) election pursuant

either case, where none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries files Tax
Returns that the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, is or may be

in accordance with GAAP, on the consolidated financial statements included in
the most recent Company SEC Documents.

 (d) The current liability with respect to unpaid Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date of the most recent Company SEC Documents does not, in the aggregate, exceed by a material amount the amount of the current liability accruals with respect to Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes) reflected on the consolidated financial statements included in the most recent Company SEC Documents. The consolidated financial statements of the Company comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 (Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes), as codified in FASB SAC 740 ("FIN 48"). Since the date of the most recent Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability with respect to Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses (within the meaning of GAAP) outside the ordinary course of business in accordance with past custom and practice. The Company has authorized Parent to access the work papers of the outside auditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to (i) the components of the accrual for deferred Taxes contained on the consolidated financial statements included in the most recent Company SEC Documents and (ii) compliance with FIN 48.

Company and any of its Subsidiaries have been made at arms length for all
applicable Tax purposes, and (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have satisfied the documentation requirements for all transfer
pricing arrangements for purposes of Section 482 of the Code (and any
comparable or similar provisions of applicable Law). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has a material amount of deferred gain or loss
arising out of any deferred intercompany transactions (as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13). The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of (i) all material Tax Returns (including
amendments) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods for which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet expired;
(ii) all material Tax rulings, revenue agent reports, settlement agreements,
and "closing agreements" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
comparable or similar provisions of applicable Law) submitted by, received by
or agreed to by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods for which the applicable statute of limitations has not
yet expired; and (iii) all schedules identifying each Tax exposure that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has recognized in accordance with FIN 48
(or any comparable or similar provisions of applicable Law). In the event
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.6012-2 were finalized in its current
form, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries would be required to
disclose any items other than those addressed in the schedules identified in
clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any "reportable transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any comparable or similar provisions of applicable Law).

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed an Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 or otherwise elected to change its classification for federal income Tax purposes. 

   

 Section 4.18 _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) Section 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of each material deferred compensation, incentive compensation, sales incentive, stock purchase, stock option and other equity or equity-based compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement; each severance or termination pay, medical, surgical, hospitalization, disability, Section 125 flexible benefit, life insurance, retiree health insurance, retiree life insurance, and other "welfare" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA; each retirement, defined benefit pension, savings, individual account based savings, supplemental retirement plan, profit-sharing, stock bonus or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA); each fringe benefit, bonus, employment, consulting, retention, change in control, termination or severance plan, program, fund, agreement or arrangement; and each other material employee benefit plan, fund, program or agreement or arrangement, in each case, whether oral or written, whether or not subject to ERISA, that is, in each case, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their ERISA Affiliates, or to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates is party, for the benefit of any director, employee, consultant, or independent contractor or former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or 

      ##### 

  

    

could have any liability, contingent or otherwise, including as a result of

Each Company Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified or, if no such determination has been made, an application for such determination is pending with the Internal Revenue Service. Nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of each such Company Plan which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or under the Code. 

   

 (c) No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Company Plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. There are no material unfunded liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(17) of ERISA) of any Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, for which any of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of its or their Subsidiaries or its or their ERISA Affiliates, could reasonably be expected to incur liability under Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No liability under Title IV, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has been incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to Parent, Company, the Surviving Company, any of its or their Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course (which premiums have been paid when due) and other than liabilities that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Company. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their ERISA Affiliates have, within the six (6) years immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, withdrawn or partially withdrawn from any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their ERISA Affiliates have, within the past twelve (12) months, received written notice from any "multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) that it is in reorganization or is insolvent, that increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits or the imposition of any excise Tax, or that such plan intends to terminate or has terminated. 

   

 (e) Each Company Plan has been drafted, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, except that, with respect to any Company Plan acquired in connection with the acquisition of Alpharma, Inc., to the Knowledge of the Company, each such plan has been drafted, operated and administered in all material respects in 

    ##### 

  

    

accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. 

   

 (f) Except to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code, no Company Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for directors, consultants, independent contractors, employees or former directors, consultants, independent contractors, or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond the last day of the month of their retirement or other termination of service. No Company Plan is funded, in whole or in part, through a voluntary employees beneficiary association exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

   

 (g) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee, consultant or independent contractor, or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of compensation due any such director, employee, consultant or independent contractor. No payment or benefit paid or provided, or to be paid or provided, whether contingent or otherwise, to current or former employees, directors or other service providers of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including pursuant to this Agreement) will fail to be deductible for federal income Tax purposes under Section 280G of the Code. No Company Plan or other agreement with any employee provides for a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code. 

   

 (h) Within the three (3) years immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payments that have, or has been or is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that have resulted, or will result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any compensation which would be subject to the deduction limit imposed by Code Section 162(m). 

   

 (i) There are no pending Actions, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Actions, audits or investigations against any Company Plan, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any fiduciary of any Company Plans, or otherwise involving any Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

any director, employee, consultant, or independent contractor or former
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any of its

Effective January 1, 2011 (or, for Covered Employees who participate in bonus plans of the Company other than the Executive Management Incentive Award Plan, the Management Incentive Award Plan, or the Team-Based Employee Incentive Award Plan, as of the first performance period beginning after the Effective Time) and during the remainder of the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Covered Employee with annual cash bonus opportunity that is substantially comparable to those offered by the Company immediately before the Effective Time at target base salary multiples (or other target amounts) that are no less favorable than the target base salary multiples or other targets in effect for such Covered Employee during 2010, but with payment based on achievement of performance criteria determined by Parent and applicable generally to similarly-situated or comparable employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries in a consistent and good faith manner during the Continuation Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2010, the Company shall establish in good faith, in reasonable consultation with Parent, annual cash bonus opportunities that are consistent with the Companys past practice for any performance period that begins before the Effective Time. 

        ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Benefit Plans_.

As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company and its Subsidiaries (as well as predecessor entities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding, other than with respect to severance and vacation benefits, entitlement to benefits and benefit accrual); for the avoidance of doubt, service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any (i) non-elective employer contributions under any Parent Section 401(k) plan or (ii) Parent retiree medical program in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time.

        ##### 

  

    

existence on the date hereof with any directors and officers of the Company
(it being understood that in no event shall Parent be obligated to provide
any such indemnification under circumstances in which the Company would not
be so required), (b) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the
Company or the Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the case may
be, charter and by-laws for a period of six (6) years after the Acceptance
Time, the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents and (c) cause to be
maintained for a period of six (6) years after the Acceptance Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the
Surviving Corporation (or any successor) may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Acceptance
Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions),
provided, however, that in no event will the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, be required to expend annually in excess of
250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage
(and to the extent the annual premium would exceed 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to
be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 250% of
such annual premium). In addition, Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, may satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.12_ by
purchasing a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to
the benefit of _Section 6.12_ of this Agreement, as applicable, than the
existing directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance
maintained by the Company, covering, without limitation, the Transactions. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
