Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the &ldquo;<B>Certificates</B>&rdquo;); and (ii)&nbsp;uncertificated shares

in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for

equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate; by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates
so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an &ldquo;agent&rsquo;s message&rdquo; by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated

of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest
thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent
in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.7.</P>

Financing is increased by an equivalent amount or the representations in Section&nbsp;4.11(d)&nbsp;(as though made at the time
of the effectuation of such amendment, modification, supplement or replacement) shall remain true and correct after taking into

conditions precedent (except in connection with any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter made

expected to (A)&nbsp;delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B)&nbsp;make the timely funding of the Financing less likely to occur
in any respect; or (iii)&nbsp;adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its

the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become due in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall
not agree to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall not release or consent to the termination
of the obligations of the Debt Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as provided therein), unless other
Alternative Debt Financing is incurred by a corresponding amount and the terms of such Alternative Debt Financing would not otherwise
violate the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.5. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter for any reason, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of such event and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i)&nbsp;obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the Equity Financing and the available portion of the Debt Financing,
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder, as the case may be (the &ldquo;<B>Alternative Debt Financing</B>&rdquo;),

commitment letters, together with any related fee letters, exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements,
the &ldquo;<B>New Debt Commitment Letters</B>&rdquo;), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letter in whole or in part. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1)&nbsp;any portion of
the Debt Financing anticipated under the Debt Commitment Letter to be structured as a high yield bond financing is unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, and such amount is not funded through a securities demand under the Debt Commitment Letter,

such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions

Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) and (3)&nbsp;a bridge facility contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (or an alternative bridge facility or other financing obtained in accordance with this Section&nbsp;6.5(b))
is available on the terms described in the Debt Commitment Letter subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth
therein, then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Debt Financing Sources to fund such bridge financing
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the proceeds shall be used in lieu of the affected portion of the
high yield bond financing. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (except that
economic terms and &ldquo;pricing flex&rdquo; provisions may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would (i)&nbsp;reduce
the amount of the hereinafter defined Alternative Debt Financing below the amount necessary for Parent to complete the Merger,
(ii)&nbsp;adversely affect the amount (including the net cash proceeds to Parent), conditionality, availability, timing or termination
of the Alternative Debt Financing, as hereinafter defined, (iii)&nbsp;reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the consummation
of the hereinafter defined Alternative Debt Financing or (iv)&nbsp;impose new or additional<FONT STYLE="background-color: white">,

expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms (including any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions)
that would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Debt Financing would be funded less likely. In the
event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A)&nbsp;any reference in this Agreement to the &ldquo;Financing Commitment
Letters&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Debt Commitment Letter&rdquo; will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect,

financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing. Without the Company&rsquo;s prior
written consent, Parent shall not directly or indirectly take any action that would or would reasonably be expected to result in
the Debt Financing not being available or that would or would reasonably be expected to materially delay the availability of the

any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter or any Guaranty, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of any or all thereof, in the Court of Chancery of

as provided in Section&nbsp;8.3. Each party hereto agrees that the right of specific performance is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Each party hereto accordingly agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such
party under this Agreement, all in accordance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;9.8. Each party hereto further agrees that no
