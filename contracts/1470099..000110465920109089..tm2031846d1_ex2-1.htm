any laws applicable to the Merger designed or intended to screen, prohibit or
regulate foreign investments based on public order or security criteria, the

Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the "Charter"), will be amended and
restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate
of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation
will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and such certificate of incorporation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that at
the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties or by Parent and the applicable holder, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the
following will occur:

   



  

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or
Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
$7.05, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11); and

  



  

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the
Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company
Shares") will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

  



  

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company
Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger
nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Company Shares") will not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such
Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in Section 2.9.

  



  

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The
Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle
any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For
purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii), "participate" means that Parent will be
kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected),
and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but
will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth
above.

at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company RSUs that
are unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

  



  

(i) _Vested Company RSUs_. Each Vested Company RSU shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Vested Company RSU, multiplied by (B) the Per
Share Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "RSU
Consideration").

  



  

(ii) _Accelerating RSUs_. Each Company RSU that is not a Vested
Company RSU but that is subject to an Acceleration Provision (an
"Accelerating RSU") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the RSU Consideration the holder
of the Accelerating RSU would have received had the Accelerating RSU been a
Vested Company RSU (the "Accelerating RSU Consideration"), provided that the
payment of the Accelerating RSU Consideration shall be made at the same
time(s) that the Accelerating RSUs would have vested in accordance with their
terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Accelerating RSUs
remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (provided that any terms
and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the
holder's employment in connection with or following the Merger shall continue
to apply to the Accelerating RSU Consideration). The holder of the
Accelerating RSU must execute and allow to become effective an Accelerating
RSU Agreement in a form that is reasonably agreed to, before the Closing, by
the Company and Parent.

  



  

(iii) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU that is not a
Vested Company RSU or an Accelerating RSU shall be cancelled for no
consideration effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the

portion of any Company PSU that would have accelerated by its terms upon a
change in control during the relevant performance period, shall be cancelled
and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the maximum number of target shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Vested Company PSU, multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the "PSU Consideration").

  



  

(ii) _Accelerating PSUs_. Each Company PSU that is not a Vested
Company PSU but that is subject to an Acceleration Provision (an
"Accelerating PSU") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the PSU Consideration the holder
of the Accelerating PSU would have received had the Accelerating PSU been a
Vested Company PSU (the "Accelerating PSU Consideration"), provided that the
payment of the Accelerating PSU Consideration shall be made at the same
time(s) that the Accelerating PSUs would have vested in accordance with their
terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Accelerating PSUs
remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (provided, that any terms
and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the
holder's employment in connection with or following the Merger shall continue
to apply to the Accelerating PSU Consideration). The holder of the
Accelerating PSU must execute and allow to become effective an Accelerating
PSU Agreement in a form that is reasonably agreed to, before the Closing, by
the Company and Parent.

  



  

(iii) _Unvested Company PSUs_. Each Company PSU that is not a
Vested Company PSU or an Accelerating PSU shall be cancelled for no
consideration effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the

(c) _Company Options_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company Options that are
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

  



  

(i) _Vested Options_. Each Vested Company Option shall be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option, multiplied by (B) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Price over the applicable per share exercise price under
such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the
"Option Consideration").

  



  

(ii) _Accelerating Options_. Each Company Option that is not a
Vested Company Option but that is subject to an Acceleration Provision (an
"Accelerating Option") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration the
holder of the Accelerating Option would have received had the Accelerating
Option been a Vested Company Option (the "Accelerating Option
Consideration"), provided that the payment of the Accelerating Option
Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) that the Accelerating Options
would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to
the holder of the Accelerating Options remaining in continuous service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each
such vesting date (provided, that any terms and conditions relating to
accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder's employment in
connection with or following the Merger shall continue to apply to the
Accelerating Option Consideration). The holder of the Accelerating Option
must execute and allow to become effective an Accelerating Option Agreement
in a form that is reasonably agreed to, before the Closing, by the Company and
Parent.

  



  

(iii) _Unvested Options_. Each Company Option that is not a Vested
Company Option or an Accelerating Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the
consummation of the Merger). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the per
share exercise price of any Company Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Price, such Company Option shall be cancelled immediately upon the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 2.8(c) without payment or
consideration.

Company Options, Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs through, to the
extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation's payroll (subject to any
required Tax withholdings) to the applicable holders of such Vested Company
Options, Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Vested Company Options, Vested
Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section
2.8(b) or Section 2.8(c), as applicable, cannot be made through the Surviving

Accelerating PSU Consideration, Accelerating RSU Consideration or
Accelerating Option Consideration becomes due and payable, the portion of the
Accelerating PSU Consideration, Accelerating RSU Consideration or Accelerating
Option Consideration net of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable
through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation's payroll

Accelerating PSU Consideration, Accelerating RSU Consideration or
Accelerating Option Consideration cannot be made through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving
Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check
will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the first
administratively practicable date following the applicable vesting date.

  



  

(f) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary
to effect the cancellation of Company RSUs, Company PSUs, and Company
Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). All Company Equity Plans will terminate
as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Employee Plan or
Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect
of the capital stock of the Company Group will be cancelled as of the
Effective Time, and the Company will take all action necessary to effect the
foregoing. Following the Effective Time no participant in any Company Equity
Plan or other Employee Plan or party to any Contract providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company Group will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and no promise or commitment to grant Company
Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs or any other security of the Company
will remain outstanding.

  



  

(g) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to
the Company's 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to
provide that each individual participating in an Offering Period (as defined
in the ESPP) in progress on the date hereof will not be permitted to (i)
increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from
the rate in effect as of the date hereof; or (ii) make separate non-payroll
contributions to the ESPP on or following the date hereof, except as may be
required by applicable law. No individual who is not participating in the ESPP
with respect to any current Offering Period as of the date hereof will be
allowed to commence participation in the ESPP following the date hereof. From
and after the date hereof, the Company Board shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that no new Offering Period or purchase period will commence
pursuant to the ESPP after the date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Offering Period that would otherwise
be outstanding at the Effective Time to terminate no later than five days
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened Offering Period,
but otherwise treat any shortened Offering Period as a fully effective and
completed Offering Period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; and (C) cause
the exercise (as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which
the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the
ESPP. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of
such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant's payroll withholding
account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as
of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the
Company will terminate the ESPP.

  



  

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such
cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A)
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B)
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section
2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent
(or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income
from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

  



  

   

\- 18 -

 



    



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three
Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (ii) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares)
(the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal which shall be in a
form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Payment Agent), and shall have such other customary provisions, as
Parent and the Company mutually agree prior to the Effective Time; and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates
for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will
accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

  



  

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the
Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price (such amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will
transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and
the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate,
or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect
to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered.

  



  

   

\- 19 -

 



    



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look
for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share
Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares at the date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
Representatives) previously entitled thereto.

  



  

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share
Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7(a), or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per
Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will
(subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will
issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond
in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs,
Company PSUs, or Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. With respect to withholdings from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Stockholder, prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Payment Agent, as
appropriate, shall provide notice to the Company upon becoming aware of any
such withholding obligation and shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to
obtain reduction of or relief from such withholding.

Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the

right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized to take all
such lawful and necessary action.

owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in
the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated Bylaws

actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) except

Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company

Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such

may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

  



  

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, no
action is necessary for the restrictions on business combinations set forth

law to not be applicable to the Merger.

stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, each Subsidiary of

material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the

management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required

assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over

detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of

4.5 _Legal Proceedings; Orders_.

  



  

(a) _No Legal Proceedings_. There are no Legal Proceedings (other

4.8 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the Merger, and, prior to the Effective
Time, Merger Sub has not engaged in any other business activities and has
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than those incident to its
formation and other than as contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or
any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing, the Guaranty, and this Agreement. Parent owns beneficially and of
record all of the outstanding capital stock, and other equity and voting

a true, correct and complete copy of an executed commitment letter, dated as

Parent to complete the Merger, (ii) adversely affect the amount (including
the net cash proceeds to Parent), conditionality, availability, timing or
termination of the Debt Financing, as hereinafter defined, (iii) reasonably

Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which the
agents, arrangers, managers, lenders and other entities party thereto
(excluding Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors), including the parties to
any joinder agreements joining such parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
parties (excluding Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor) to the definitive

Representatives and their respective successors and assigns, collectively, but
not including Parent, Merger Sub, or the Guarantors, the "Debt Financing
Sources" and, together with the Equity Financing Sources, the "Financing
Sources") have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, debt financing for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein in the aggregate amount set forth therein
(the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the
"Financing").

  



  

   

-35-

 



    



  

(c) _No Amendments_. As of the date hereof, (i) the Financing
Commitment Letters and the terms of the Financing have not been
amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified

and there are not contemplated to be other, Contracts, agreements, side
letters or arrangements (oral or written, contingent or otherwise) to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set

of the Financing or any portion thereof on the Closing Date. Other than as
set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, there are no conditions
precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing on the terms in the Financing Commitment Letters.

  



  

(d) _Sufficiency of Financing_. Assuming the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied and the Financing is
funded in accordance with terms of the Financing Commitment Letters, on the
Closing Date, the net proceeds of the Financing (both before and after giving
effect to the maximum amount of flex provided under the Debt Commitment
Letter) will be, in the aggregate, sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to
(i) make the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to Article II in
connection with or as a result of the Merger or otherwise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all payments of
merger consideration and all payments with respect to Vested Company Options,
Accelerating Options, Vested Company RSUs, Accelerating RSUs, Vested Company
PSUs, and Accelerating PSUs, and (ii) pay all fees and expenses required to be
paid at the Closing by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and
the Financing. In no event shall the receipt by, or the availability of any
funds or financing to, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Validity_. As of the date hereof, (i) the Equity Commitment
Letter (in the form delivered by Parent to the Company) is in full force and
effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Guarantors, as applicable, enforceable against Parent,
Merger Sub and the Guarantors, as applicable, in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Enforceability Limitations and (ii) the Debt Commitment Letter
(in the form delivered by Parent to the Company) is in full force and effect
and constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in

than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
proceeds of the Financing, including pursuant to any agreement relating to
the Financing to which the Guarantors, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates, is a party. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
Parent, there are no material inaccuracies in any of the representations or
warranties of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors, as applicable under the
Financing Commitment Letters, or which would otherwise result in any portion
of the Financing to be unavailable, and no event has occurred that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to,
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, pursuant
to the Financing Commitment Letters (it being understood that Parent and
Merger Sub are not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect
of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III or the
Company's compliance hereunder). As of the date of this Agreement, assuming
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied,
Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) that any of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters will not be
satisfied on a timely basis, and Parent has no reason to believe that any
portion of the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub at the
Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully
paid, any and all commitment or other fees or deposits that are due and
payable on or prior to the date hereof, in each case pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters, and will pay in
full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date.

financing (other than a Debt Financing Source) from providing or seeking to
provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company Group in connection
with the Merger.

  



  

4.12 _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date
hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates is
a party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or
committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or
other understandings (whether or not binding) with any stockholder (other than
any existing limited partner of the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates),
director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a)
relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations
(including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or
(b) pursuant to which any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per
Share Price in respect of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock; (ii)
such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or
vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director,
officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company other than the Guarantors
has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

  



  

4.13 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after
giving effect to the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable
pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger and
all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), (a) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and such Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities;
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured;
(b) each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees
that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in

Representatives as having been authorized by the Company Group or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives (or any other Person); and the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement are in lieu of and are
exclusive of all other representations and warranties, express or implied,
including any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for
a particular purpose or as to the accuracy or completeness of any statement

warranties, express or implied, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to

Representatives of any documentation or other information (including any
financial information, supplemental data or financial projections or
other forward-looking statements).

itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the

Section 5.3, from and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any Person and its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively,
"Representatives") that would be prohibited by this Section 5.3(a), request
the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the

immediately preceding the date hereof and will (A) cease providing any further

instruct, authorize or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to,

(ii) furnish to any Person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or
any designees of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Representatives) any
non-public information relating to the Company Group or afford to any Person
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company Group (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives), in any such case with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than informing such
Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3);

  



  

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes,
or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (provided,
however, that this subsection shall not preclude internal non-public
deliberations and actions of the Company Board and management (which actions
by themselves do not trigger disclosure requirements for the Company) and non-
public discussions of the Company Board and management with its advisors, in
each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal); or

  



  

   

-41-

 



    



  

(v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to
an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  



  

From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will
not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of
any standstill or confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such
provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made
to the Company Board (or any committee thereof).

  



  

(b) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary
set forth in this Section 5.3, from the date hereof until the
Company's receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through
one or more of their Representatives (including the Advisor):

  



  

(i) respond to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal (A) to
inform such Person of the restrictions of this Section 5.3 by providing a
link to this Agreement (as publicly filed) and directing such Person to this
section and (B) additionally for the limited purpose of clarifying (but for
the avoidance of doubt not accepting or negotiating) the written terms and
conditions set forth in such Acquisition Proposal; and

  



  

(ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company Group to, or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company Group pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person or its Representatives that
has made or delivered to the Company an bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal on or after the date hereof, and otherwise facilitate such
Acquisition Proposal or assist such Person (and its Representatives and
financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested
by such Person), in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from any material breach of Section 5.3(a);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this Section 5.3(b)(ii), the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the
actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would reasonably be expected to
violate its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that the Company will promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company Group that is provided to any such Person or its
Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.

  



  

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at
no time after the date hereof may the Company Board (or a committee thereof):

  



  

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;

  



  

(B) adopt or approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an
Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that this subsection (B) shall not
preclude internal non-public deliberations and actions of the Company Board
and management (which actions by themselves do not trigger disclosure
obligations by the Company) and non-public discussions of the Company Board
and management with its advisors, in each case with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal);

  



  

(C) if an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made, following the written
request by Parent, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within 10 Business Days (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, provided that Parent shall
not make any such request for reaffirmation less than 3 Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting) after Parent so requests in writing (it
being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions, or after the Requisite
Stockholder Approval has been obtained);

  



  

   

-42-

 



    



  

(D) fail to recommend publicly against a tender offer or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would constitute an Acquisition Transaction and that
was commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, within ten (10) Business Days following the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall
not be required to make any such recommendation more than once for any tender
or exchange offer or with respect to any tender or exchange offer after the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has made a recommendation with respect
to such tender or exchange offer, and once with respect to any modification
or revision to the price, conditions or other material terms of such tender
offer or exchange offer that is made public that requires the Company Board
to amend its recommendation with respect to such tender or exchange
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or after
the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained; or

  



  

(E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement

  



  

(any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board
Recommendation Change"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, none of (1) the determination by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (2)
the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section
5.3(d) will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or

  



  

(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:

  



  

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to any material event or development or material change
in circumstances that was (A) not actually known to the Company Board as of
the date hereof (or if known, the effect of which was not actually known by
the Company Board); and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal;
or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any
internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period
ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date hereof in the
market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or the credit
rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying cause of any
of the foregoing in this clause (b) may be considered and taken into
account) (each such event, an "Intervening Event"), if the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary obligations pursuant to
applicable law and if and only if:

  



  

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) has (A) so determined that an Intervening Event has
occurred; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which notice will specify the applicable
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

  



  

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company and its Representatives, during such three Business Day
period, must have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate and has made its
Representatives available) to make such adjustments offered by Parent to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof), taking into account any such adjustments (which
adjustments, to the extent accepted and executed and delivered by the
Company, would be binding on Parent), no longer determines that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening
Event would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary obligations
pursuant to applicable law and (B) if Parent so requests in a timely fashion,
in good faith considered permitting, and to the extent permitted, provided
reasonable opportunity for, Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board during such three Business Day period
regarding any adjustments to this Agreement; or

  



  

   

-43-

 



    



  

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B)
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case if and only if:

  



  

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
violate its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law;

  



  

(2) the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all
material respects with their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least three Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii) absent any
acceptable revision (which revision, to the extent accepted and executed and
delivered by the Company, would be binding on Parent) to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of
the Person or "group" of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms thereof and copies of the definitive agreement and material
ancillary agreements, including written financing commitments, in the
Company's possession relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, must have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate and has made its
Representatives available) to make such adjustments offered by Parent to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, (2) if Parent so requests in a
timely fashion, in good faith considered permitting, and to the extent
permitted, provided reasonable opportunity for, Parent and its
Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board during the Notice
Period regarding any adjustments to this Agreement, and (3)  after
considering any material adjustments to this Agreement (including a change to
the price terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may
be offered by Parent (which, to the extent accepted and executed and delivered
by the Company, would be binding on Parent) during the Notice Period, the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has reaffirmed the determinations
set forth in Section 5.3(d)(ii)(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal (for the
avoidance of doubt, revisions to economic terms (e.g., price) and conditions
shall be deemed material), the Company will be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
5.3(d)(ii)(3) (other than the presentation to the Company Board as
contemplated by item (2) above) with respect to such new written notice,
except that the Notice Period shall only be two Business Days with respect
thereto; and

  



  

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to
cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1(h).

  



  

(e) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII
and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within
24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute
an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (i) the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such
inquiries, offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is
prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such
Person or "group" of Persons that is in effect on the date of this
Agreement); (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers
or proposals; and (iii) copies of all relevant written proposals and
agreements relating to such inquiries, offers or proposals that
constitute and Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status (and
supplementally provide the terms and documents and other written materials)
of any such inquiries, offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto)
and the status and material terms of any such discussions or negotiations.

  



  

   

-44-

 



    



  

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will
prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from
complying with its obligations under U.S. federal or state law or from making
any disclosure to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, if not made could reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's directors under
applicable law, it being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be
deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
Section 5.3(d). In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes
of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) that describes the Company's receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed
to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval
or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company
Board Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any
breach of this Section 5.3 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to be
a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the

hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will use their respective
reasonable best efforts (A) to take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (B)
do (or cause to be done) all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing (or causing to be done) all things, in each case as
are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger, including by:

  



  

(i) causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied;

  



  

(ii) (1) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities; and (2) making all
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, in
each case that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger;

  



  

(iii) obtaining all consents, waivers and approvals and delivering
all notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Material Contracts
as of and following the consummation of the Merger; and

  



  

(iv) executing and delivering any Contracts and other instruments
that are reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger.

  



  

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the
foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
neither Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other
hand, will take any action, or fail to take any action, that (i) is intended
to or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of preventing
or impairing (A) the consummation of the Merger (including by delaying
consummation of the Merger beyond the Termination Date); or (B) the ability of
such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or
(ii) has or is intended to have the effect of delaying or otherwise adversely
affecting the consummation of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, no
action by the Company taken in compliance with Section 5.3 will be considered

(c) _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company

connection with the Merger, including in connection with obtaining any
consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

  



  

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

  



  

(a) _Filing Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust

respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company shall

to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to Parent and the
Company, (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a
Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Merger as
required by the HSR Act within five Business Days following the date hereof;
and (ii) promptly file pre-merger or post-merger notification filings, forms
and submissions with any Governmental Authority pursuant to other applicable
Antitrust Laws in connection with the Merger, with Parent having primary

will use reasonable efforts to (A) cooperate and coordinate (and cause its
respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with the other in the
making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause the other to be
supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings; (C) supply (or cause the other to be supplied) any additional
information that may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the

make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

  



  

(b) _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Merger

applicable) will use reasonable best efforts to (i) offer, negotiate, commit
to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the
sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital
stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
Group, on the other hand; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the
one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand; and (ii) contest, defend
and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, except, in each
case, to the extent such actions would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective
Affiliates.

  



  

   

-46-

 



    



   



  

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable
laws, (i) promptly notify the other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish
the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
others of the contents of) any material communication received by such Person
from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the
other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith
any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft
notifications, formal notifications, filing, submission or other written
communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations,
correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with
the Merger to a Governmental Authority (other than with respect to the filing
pursuant to the HSR Act); (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably
informed with respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect thereof, including with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action,
action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any
waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement
of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or
proceeding under applicable laws and (D) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate
in any meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by
telephone or otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect
of the Merger without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of
such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-
public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to
"outside counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with
employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other Party
without approval of the Party providing the non-public information;
_provided, however_ , that each of Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact
any valuation and related information before sharing any information provided
to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only
basis.

  



  

(d) _Prohibited Parent Actions_. During the period from the date
of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, consummate, enter into any agreement
providing for or announce any acquisition, business combination or similar
transaction, in each case that is intended to or has (or would reasonably be
expected to have) the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger or
delaying consummation of the Merger beyond the Termination Date.

  



  

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

  



  

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date hereof, the
Company will prepare, and use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC, a
preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy
Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 5.3, the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines
that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with
the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable law (such
document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"),
then the Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company
Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as
to form with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of
the SEC and Nasdaq. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the
Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. Each of the Company
and Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto, including, in the case of Parent, any information
regarding the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty or the Guarantors,
whether provided by Parent or by any of the Guarantors, will, at the date
of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meeting of Company
Stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing.

(c) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all
information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. If
at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so
that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will
promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such
filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with
the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law
or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

  



  

(d) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, as the case may be, without first providing the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication, and each Party will give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or
their respective counsel.

  



  

(e) _Notices; Comments_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for (i) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from
the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or
its staff for additional information in connection therewith. Subject to the
requirements of Section 6.3(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly a reasonably practicable to any comments from
the SEC with respect the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company
Filing, as the case may be.

  



  

(f) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable
law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and
confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed
its review of, the Proxy Statement. All mailings to the Company Stockholders
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to
the reasonable prior review and comment of Parent and the Company will give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent or its counsel. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Company shall conduct in a timely manner a "broker search" in accordance with
Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

  



  

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary
in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq
to establish a record date for (and the Company will not change the record
date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "Company
Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and
hold the Company Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the 20th Business
Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders.
Subject to Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and
proxy tallies following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall, upon the request of Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a
reasonable basis during the last ten Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

  



  

   

-48-

 



    



  

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company or Parent reasonably
determines in good faith that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is unlikely
to be obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting, including due to an
absence of a quorum, then on no more than two occasions (for each of the
Company and Parent) and prior to the vote contemplated having been taken,
each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to require a postponement
or adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
soliciting additional votes in favor of this Agreement and the Merger;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no single such postponement or adjournment
pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso shall delay the Company
Stockholder Meeting by more than seven days from the prior-scheduled date or
to a date on or after the fifth Business Day preceding the Termination Date;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will
prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder
Meeting to give the holders of shares of Company Common Stock sufficient time
to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent or
otherwise made available to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(including in connection with a Change of Recommendation) or if the Company
is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by
applicable law, order, Nasdaq or SEC rule or regulation, provision of its
Charter or Bylaws, or a request from Nasdaq, the SEC or its staff. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company
will submit this Agreement and the Merger to the Company Stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (timely held in accordance with the requirements
of this Section 6.4) even if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change. The Company agrees that no
matters shall be brought before the Company Stockholder Meeting other than
the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger, and any related
"golden parachute" vote under Rule14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any
related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the
meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies for the purposes of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval).

  



  

6.5 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub
will not (without the prior written consent of the Company) permit any
termination, replacement, supplement, amendment or modification to be made
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, any of the Financing
Commitment Letters if such termination, replacement, supplement, amendment,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
(or have the effect of reducing) either the aggregate amount of or the net
proceeds to Parent from the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is
increased by an equivalent amount or the representations in Section 4.11(d)
(as though made at the time of the effectuation of such amendment,
modification, supplement or replacement) shall remain true and correct after
taking into account such reduction) or reduce the aggregate amount of the
Equity Financing as the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing, as
applicable, are in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) impose new or
additional, or adversely modify any existing, conditions precedent (except in
connection with any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
made available to the Company as of the date of this Agreement) to the
funding of the Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(A) delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the
Financing less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters (
_provided_ that, each of Parent and Merger Sub may, without the prior written
consent of the Company, amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to (x) add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement (it being understood that to the extent any lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities are added to
the Debt Commitment Letter as set forth in this clause (iii) pursuant to
customary joinder arrangements and the commitments of the Commitment Parties
(as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) are ratably
reduced in connection therewith, such customary joinder arrangements will be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) and (y) enter into a Replacement
Commitment Facility (as defined in the Commitment Letter). Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to,
take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement that is a breach
of, or would or would reasonably be expected to result in termination of, any
of the Financing Commitment Letters. Any reference in this Agreement to (1)
the "Equity Financing", "Debt Financing" or "Financing" will include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 6.5; and (2) "Equity Commitment
Letter",  "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Financing Commitment Letters" will
include such document as amended or modified in compliance with this Section
6.5.

  



  

(b) _Equity Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange
and obtain the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Equity Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the
Equity Commitment Letter; (iii) consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to
the Closing; (iv) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter; and (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter.

  



  

   

-49-

 



    



  

(c) _Debt Financing And Alternative Debt Financing._ Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing and obtain the
financing contemplated thereby as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Closing) on
the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise
of any flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter and the applicable definitive agreements in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (including any "flex"
provisions), subject to modifications not prohibited hereunder (ii) comply
with its covenants and obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, subject to modifications not prohibited hereunder (iv)
satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver to) all conditions to funding
that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, including in the event of a breach by the Debt Financing
Source under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing, and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing, including by using its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing. Parent
and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or
other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they
become due in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent
shall not agree to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the Debt
Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as provided
therein), unless other Alternative Debt Financing is incurred by a
corresponding amount and the terms of such Alternative Debt Financing would
not otherwise violate the provisions of this Section 6.5. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company in writing of such event and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions not less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the
Equity Financing and the available portion of the Debt Financing, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder, as the case may be (the
"Alternative Debt Financing"), and (ii) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (such new
financing commitment letters, together with any related fee letters,
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other
agreements, the "New Debt Commitment Letters"), which New Debt Commitment
Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part.
In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
(1) any portion of the Debt Financing anticipated under the Debt Commitment
Letter to be structured as a high yield bond financing is
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, and such amount is not funded
through a securities demand under the Debt Commitment Letter, (2) all
conditions contained in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied or
waived (other than (x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing, and (y) those conditions the failure of which to
be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) and (3) a bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (or an alternative bridge facility or other financing obtained in
accordance with this Section 6.5(b)) is available on the terms described in
the Debt Commitment Letter subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth therein, then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the applicable Debt Financing Sources to fund such bridge financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the proceeds shall
be used in lieu of the affected portion of the high yield bond financing.
Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt
Commitment Letters (except that economic terms and "pricing flex" provisions
may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would (i)
reduce the amount of the hereinafter defined Alternative Debt Financing below
the amount necessary for Parent to complete the Merger, (ii) adversely affect
the amount (including the net cash proceeds to Parent), conditionality,
availability, timing or termination of the Alternative Debt Financing, as
hereinafter defined, (iii) reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay
the consummation of the hereinafter defined Alternative Debt Financing or
(iv) impose new or additional, or adversely modify any existing, conditions
precedent). No Alternative Debt Financing or New Debt Commitment Letter
may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of
the Debt Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms (including any
"flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood
that the Alternative Debt Financing would be funded less likely. In the event
that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment
Letter" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent
not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and
any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing. Without the Company's prior written consent,
Parent shall not directly or indirectly take any action that would or would
reasonably be expected to result in the Debt Financing not being available or
that would or would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
availability of the Debt Financing.

(d) _Updates. _ Upon reasonable request by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of any
material developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any Alternative Debt Financing) and provide to the Company
copies of all executed amendments, modifications, consents or waivers to or
under any Financing Commitment Letters and all executed and substantially
final material draft definitive documents related to the Financing.

  



  

(e) _Notice_. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(d),
Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) (i) of any default or breach (or any
event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter or material definitive document
related to the Financing of which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from the Debt Financing Source or Guarantors with
respect to any actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter or any
material definitive document related to the Financing, (iii) of the
occurrence of an event or development that would reasonably be expected to
have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and Equity Commitment Letter on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by such letters or the material definitive documents
related to the Financing, (iv) any termination, cancellation or repudiation
by any party to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or material
definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware; (v) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any notice or
other communication from any Person with respect to any material dispute or
disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letter,
Equity Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Financing
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at the Closing (but excluding ordinary course
negotiations); and (vi) if for any reason Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates believes in good faith that (A) there is (or there is likely to
be) a material dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the
Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter or the definitive documents
related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing
or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing (but excluding
ordinary course negotiations) or (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Financing will not be available for any reason on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters or
any definitive documents related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(f) _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 will
require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger
Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i)
bring any enforcement action against any source of the Financing to enforce
its rights pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letter (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit
for specific performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks
and is granted a decree of specific performance of the obligation to
consummate the Merger); or (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source
other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated
by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

contemplation hereof) binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v)

Effective Time, and the Company Group will not be required to take any action
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
(other than customary representation letters, authorization letters and
undertakings (including with respect to the presence or absence of material
non-public information and the accuracy of the information contained in the

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent
will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company Group
or its Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company
Group contemplated by this Section 6.6.

  



  

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company Group and its Representatives
will, promptly upon request by the Company, be indemnified and held harmless
by Parent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), interest, awards, judgments,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in
connection with any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith. Parent's
obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this Section 6.6(f) referred to
collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

  



  

(g) _No Financing Condition_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the provisions contained in this Section 6.6 represent the sole
obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and no other provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to expand or modify such obligations. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that
obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the Financing
has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be
obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.

  



  

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
take all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute

applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that

contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

  



  

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and
the Effective Time, the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company,
except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable law or
regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information; access to such documents or information would
give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company Group is a party
or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give
a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such
Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent
to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand; _provided_
, that such access may be provided remotely to the extent the Company
determines necessary or advisable in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nothing
in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company Group or any of
its Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company Group
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company Group. Any access to the properties of the Company Group will be
subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be
directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another Person designated
by the Company.

reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity

Exchange Act.

6.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnified Parties_. From and after the Effective Time, each
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law (and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law),
each present and former director, officer and employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent
that the Company would have been permitted under applicable law.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Parent and Merger Sub agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for
advancement of expenses), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the (i)
Company\'s certificate of incorporation, (ii) the Company\'s bylaws, (iii)
the respective comparable organizational documents of the Company's
Subsidiaries, and (iv) any indemnification or other agreements (clauses (i)
through (iv), collectively, the "Indemnification Agreements") of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company (in the case of each such Indemnification
Agreement, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) will survive the
Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any claims or potential claims against such directors, officers or
employees arising out of such acts or omissions (and until such later date as
such claims and any proceedings arising therefrom are finally disposed of) or
such later date as is provided pursuant to the terms thereof, and from and
after the Effective Time, Parent will comply with and honor, and will cause
the Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor, the
foregoing obligations. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the Charter,
the Bylaws or the respective comparable organizational documents of the
Company's Subsidiaries in any manner that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such director, officer or
employee with respect to their acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including
with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that
are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the
"Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier so
long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such
"tail" policy is in full force and effect.

  



  

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Section 6.10.

  



  

   

-56-

 



    



  

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section
6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Parties, together with other persons who are
beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives), are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of
enforcement as if such person were a Party. The rights of the Indemnified
Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs
and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv)
applicable law (whether at law or in equity).

  



  

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.

  



  

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or
will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company Group for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees
of the Company Group as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time until 12 months following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments to
each Continuing Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation, benefits and severance payments provided to such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements).

  



  

(b) For all purposes under the benefit plans and arrangements of
Parent and its Subsidiaries covering any Continuing Employee (the
"New Plans"), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Continuing Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including, in each case, their predecessors)
before the Effective Time,  _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Continuing Employee, to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in all New Plans that are welfare benefit plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces or is intended to replace coverage
under a comparable Company Plan (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"). In addition, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements to be waived
for such persons. In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee
under an Old Plan to be taken into account under the corresponding New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such persons.

  



  

(c) In addition to what is afforded under Section 6.11(a), Parent
will, in its sole discretion, make cash and/or equity award, retention or
incentive scheme decisions for eligible Continuing Employees, following the
consummation of the Transaction, based on the award, retention or incentive
opportunities currently held by Parent's similarly situated employees.

  



  

(d) Parent shall assume sponsorship of the Company Stock-Settled
Bonus Plans and related awards and shall administer the Company Stock-
Settled Bonus Plans and awards in accordance with their terms. All decisions
under the Company Stock-Settled Bonus Plans shall be made, subject to the
terms of the applicable Company Stock-Settled Bonus Plans and awards, by
Parent.

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section
6.11, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) except as
provided in Section 9.6, create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement.

  



  

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable
for the failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their
respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters._

  



  

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt
notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail
to be satisfied at the Closing, except that (i) no such notification will
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties
under this Agreement and (ii) failure to so notify shall not be, nor
be deemed to be, a breach of this Section 6.13(a). The terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

  



  

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period

Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent
or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if
and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section
7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that (i) no such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions
to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies
available to the Parties under this Agreement and (ii) failure to so notify
shall not be, nor be deemed to be, a breach of this Section 6.13(b). The
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any
information provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).

  



  

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release
concerning this Agreement and the Merger of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will each be reasonably acceptable
to the other Party. Thereafter, the Company (other than with respect to the
portion of any communication relating to a Company Board Recommendation
Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties
before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any
meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar
Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably
likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the

agreement; principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners
or vendors so long as such communications are consistent with the previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the
Parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); or solely to the
extent related to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company will each provide the other with prompt notice of all
Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with
respect thereto) and keep the other reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof. Each of Parent and the Company will (a) give the other the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with the other with respect to the
defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. Neither
Parent nor the Company may compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless both Parent and the
Company have consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section
6.15, "participate" means that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will
be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the Transaction Litigation by the other party (to the extent that
the attorney-client privilege between the other party and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction
Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other

Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its

Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of either of the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors
of each Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

  



  

6.18 _No Control of the Other Party 's Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are

Section 7.2(a) or (b);

  



  

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to receiving the Requisite

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

written notice thereof to the other Parties specifying the provision of
Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such termination pursuant to such
provision.

  



  

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party
(or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties,
as applicable, except that Section 6.6(e), Section 6.6(f), Section 6.14, this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.6 and Article IX will each survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing nothing in this Agreement will relieve
any Party from any liability for damages (which the parties agree in the case
of the Company shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company's
stockholders, which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the
Company) for any Willful Breach. In addition to the foregoing, no termination
of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement or the Guaranty, which rights, obligations
and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their respective terms.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this
Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any
of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect equityholders
hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any Debt Financing (including for any willful and
material breach), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
preclude any liability (x) of the Debt Financing Sources to the Company
and its Affiliates under any confidentiality agreement entered into in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (y)
under the Guaranty in accordance with its terms.

  



  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will
be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment
Agent. Conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing, Parent will pay or
cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and
(ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees
arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(b) _Company Payments_.

  



  

(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and prior to (1) in the case of Section 8.1(d), the Company
Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) or (2) in
the case of Section 8.1(e), the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has
been publicly announced or disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise
abandoned; and (C) within one year following the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition
Transaction (which Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated), then
the Company will concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition
Transaction, pay to Parent an amount equal to $30,450,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be
references to "50%."

  



  

   

-63-

 



    



  

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(f) or Section 8.1(h), then the Company must pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee either (1) if terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such termination or
(2) if terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), substantially concurrently with
such termination.

  



  

(c) _Parent Payments_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then Parent must promptly (and in any
event within two Business Days) following such termination pay, or cause to
be paid, to the Company an amount equal to $65,250,000 (the  "Parent
Termination Fee").

  



  

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
in no event will (x) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may
be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same
or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events and (y)
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Parent Termination Fee may be payable pursuant
to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and upon the occurrence of different events.

  



  

(e) _Payments; Default_.

  



  

(i) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) All payments under this Section 8.3 shall be made by the
Company to Parent (with respect to the Company Termination Fee) or by Parent
to the Company (with respect to the Parent Termination Fee), in each case, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent or the Company (as applicable). If Parent fails to provide
valid wire instructions at least two (2) Business Days prior to a deadline
for payment by the Company set forth in this Section 8.3, then such deadline
for payment shall be extended to a date that is two (2) Business Days
following the date that such wire instructions are so provided by Parent.

  



  

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth below, Parent's payment
of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c)
will be the only monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Equity
Commitment Letter, any other agreement executed in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon
payment of such amount, (1) none of (A) Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors; or (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors (the Persons in
clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") will have any
further liability or obligation to the Company (or for the avoidance of doubt
any Company Related Parties) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, any other agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or
their Affiliates) or any other applicable Parent Related Parties will remain
obligated with respect to, and the Company Group may be entitled to remedies
with respect to, the Guaranty, the Confidentiality Agreement, any Willful
Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and Section
8.3(c), as applicable); and (2) none of the Company or any other Person will
be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties
(or their Affiliates) and any other applicable Parent Related Parties will
remain obligated with respect to, and the Company Group may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Guaranty, the Confidentiality Agreement, any
Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and Section
8.3(c), as applicable). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties
seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any
other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be
entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of, in
the aggregate, the Parent Termination Fee against any Parent Related Parties,
and in no event will the Company Group be entitled to seek or obtain any
monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages, in excess, in the aggregate, of the Parent Termination Fee
against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the Guarantors, Parent or Merger
Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger
or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure (except that this sentence shall not apply in any
respect to matters relating to the Guaranty, the Confidentiality Agreement,
any Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and Section
8.3(c), as applicable). Other than the Guarantors' obligations under the
Guaranty and Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement
(including in respect of any Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, and Section 8.3(c)), in no event will any Parent Related Party or
any other Person other than the Guarantors, Parent and Merger Sub have any
liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person (including
any Company Related Parties) relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Merger, the Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (except that this sentence shall not apply in
any respect to matters relating to the Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

   

-64-

 



    



  

(ii) The Company's payment of the Company Termination Fee to the
extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only monetary damages of
Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from
(A) the Company Group and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, controlling Persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the
Company Group and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement,
any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and
upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will
have any further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters
forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their
Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company Group may
be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement,
Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (2) none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party
arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the
basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates)
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company Group may be entitled
to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(b)
and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Under no circumstances will the
collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches under this
Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to this Agreement) exceed the Company Termination Fee in the
aggregate for all such breaches (and any indemnification pursuant to Section
8.3(e)) (the "Company Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Guarantors; or the former, current and future holders of any
equity, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors seek or obtain,
nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting
on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or
obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability
Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of
any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in
excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related
Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or
actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure.

(g) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3(f), it is agreed that
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section
9.8(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may
determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific
performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section
9.8(b) and Section 9.8(c), under no circumstances will the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance that compels Parent
and Merger Sub to effect the Merger (as contemplated by and subject to the
limitations in Section 9.8(c)) and any monetary damages (e.g., the Parent
Termination Fee). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.3(g)
shall serve to limit the Company from being paid monetary damages if (i)
specific performance (other than with respect to compelling Parent and Merger
Sub to effect the Merger (as contemplated by and subject to the limitations in
Section 9.8(c)) and the Merger is actually effected) is received but the
Merger is nonetheless never effected or (ii) if specific performance is sought
to compel Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger (as contemplated by and
subject to the limitations in Section 9.8(c)) but such specific performance
is not received and the Merger is not consummated.

  



  

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law and subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the
Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
(pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)),
except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires
the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such
approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.6(a),
Section 8.2, Section 8.3(f), Section 8.6, Section 9.3(c), Section 9.6,
Section 9.8, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11, Section 9.12, and this sentence
of Section 8.4 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in
Sections 6.6(a), Section 8.2(c), Section 8.3(f), Section 8.6, Section 9.3,
Section 9.6, Section 9.8, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 or this sentence of
Section 8.4) may not be amended, modified or altered without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

  



  

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior
to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and
except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any
delay in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute
a waiver of such right.

  



  

8.6 _No Liability of Debt Financing Sources_. None of the Debt
Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of
its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder; _provided, however,_ that the foregoing shall not preclude any
liability of the Debt Financing Sources to the Company and its Affiliates
under any confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall limit the
rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time
under any debt commitment letter or the definitive debt documents executed in
connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under
this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party
thereto.

9.3 _Assignment. _ No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub will
have the right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a)
in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or Merger Sub
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their respective
Affiliates; or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise

Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty; or (ii) impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, and
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment
by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that the Company and an Affiliate of Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 6, 2020 (together with any
and all joinders thereto with additional named parties in such joinders, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), that will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company Group furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they
were parties thereto.

  



  

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or
referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any
termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the
Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly
terminated by the parties thereto.

  



  

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.6(e), Section 6.6(f), Section
6.10, and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not,
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as
set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.6(e), Section 6.6(f) or Section
6.10; (b) the Company may enforce this Agreement and seek damages on behalf
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs
and Company Options (which Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors acknowledge
and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost
premium) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(f)(i); and (c)
from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company Options to
receive the merger consideration set forth in Article II and the rights of
the recipients of Stock-Settled Bonus Plan awards to be treated in accordance
with Section 6.11(d). The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of the second
sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and
Company Options by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent
for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests
in such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs or Company Options and subsequently transfer
therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts
recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of
expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3(f)(i)) may, in the Company's sole and
absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company
to such holders as of any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by
the Company for the use and benefit of the Company in any manner that the
Company deems fit. The provisions of Section 8.2, Section 8.3(f), Section 8.4,
Section 8.6, Section 9.3(c), Section 9.8, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11 and
this Section 9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their
successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party
beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of
such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their
respective successors and assigns). The provisions of Section 8.3(f) will
inure to the benefit of the Company Related Parties and the Parent Related
Parties and their respective successors and assigns, each of whom are intended
to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that
the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Company Related
Parties and the Parent Related Parties (as applicable) and their respective
successors and assigns).

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties without notice or liability to any other Person. In
some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

9.8 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages,
under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the
Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of
specific performance).

  



  

(b) _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or any Guaranty, and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of any or all thereof, in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity, except as provided in Section 8.3.
Each party hereto agrees that the right of specific performance is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. Each party hereto accordingly agrees not to raise any objections
to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under this
Agreement, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.8. Each party
hereto further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 9.8, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. If prior to the Termination Date, any party hereto seeks or
brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party or any Guarantor, the Termination Date
shall automatically be extended until resolution of such action and
all related actions (including any appeals) or by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to enforce Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, only in
the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied
at the time the Closing would have occurred and remain satisfied, (ii) the
Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing has been funded in accordance
with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing (or Alternative Debt Financing)
and the Equity Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger if
the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing has not been funded (or will
not be funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance to cause the consummation of the
Merger other than solely under the specific circumstances and as specifically
set forth in this Section 9.8(c)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company (as opposed to Parent) be entitled to seek any remedy
of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing
Source in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt
Financing.

  



  

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts)
in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger, the Guaranty and the Equity
Commitment Letter, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or
assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware)
(the "Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out
of this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Equity Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought,
tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will
not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

  



  

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and
irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Sources
arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and
each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing
any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses provided in any applicable Debt Commitment Letter will be
effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding
brought in any such court; to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any
such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH
PARTY HERETO MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
(WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER,
THE GUARANTY, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY
FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES).
EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

  



  

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

  



  

9.13 _Counterparts. _ This Agreement and any amendments hereto may
be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered
one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
.pdf,.tif,.gif,.jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such
delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an
Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a Contract, and each
Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

  



  

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to
the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect
cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations,
warranties, covenants and Closing conditions in this Agreement will be
construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant
and Closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and
independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any
way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other
provision hereof.
