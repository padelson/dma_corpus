among Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Arsenal Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Eclipsys Corporation, a

Certain capitalized terms are defined in _Article IX_ and other

Agreement where such terms first appear.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ "), not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company,
will be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest
of, the Company and the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) recommended that the Companys stockholders adopt and
approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, based upon the recommendation of
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent, has (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interest of, Parent and Parents stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) recommended that Parents stockholders approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as an inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Misys plc, a public limited company formed under the Laws of England and Wales
(" _Manchester_ "), is entering into a voting agreement with the Company,
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting
Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as an inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
the directors of Parent set forth on _Schedule A_ are entering into voting
undertakings in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Parent Voting Undertakings_ ");

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
directors of the

 



 

-1-  Company set forth on _Schedule B_ are entering into voting undertakings in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Company Voting
Undertakings_ "); 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Manchester are entering into a Framework Agreement (as it may be
amended from time to time, the " _Framework Agreement_ ") pursuant to which
Manchester and Parent agreed, among other things and subject to certain
conditions, to (i) a direct or indirect purchase by Parent of certain shares
of Parent Common Stock held indirectly by Manchester through one or more of
its subsidiaries and (ii) a secondary public offering by Manchester or one or
more of its subsidiaries of certain additional shares of Parent Common Stock
(the transactions described in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , the " _Coniston
Transaction_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
with respect to the Merger for United States federal income tax purposes
pursuant to which the Merger is to be treated as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the election of Parent,
which shall be made in writing and delivered to the Company no fewer than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger; _provided_ , that such substituted corporation is a
Delaware corporation which is formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ that
such alternative structure does not (a) impose any material delay on, or
condition to, the consummation of the Merger, (b) cause any condition set
forth in _Article VI_ to become incapable of being satisfied (unless duly
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof), or (c) adversely affect
the Intended Tax Treatment, any of the parties hereto or any of the parties
stockholders.

 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when a
certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
"), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, upon the mutual written consent of the Company and Merger Sub, the
Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date of effectiveness of the
Merger not



 

-2-  more than 30 days after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. The
filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made as soon as practicable on
the Closing Date.

 

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.4 _Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. (a) At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law;  _provided_ that (i) paragraph 1 of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall read as
follows: "The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to as the
"Corporation") is Eclipsys Corporation." and (ii) appropriate amendments
shall be made, as necessary, to comply with the provisions of _Section
5.10(a)_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, subject to appropriate revisions thereto, as necessary,
to comply with the provisions of _Section 5.10(a)_, until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or in the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) The directors and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall become, at the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.

 

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any securities of Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the
Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be canceled and no capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) Subject to the provisions of _Sections 1.8_ and _1.10_ hereof, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
1.5(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.2 (such number being
the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). All such
shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder
of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Certificate
or the delivery of an



 

-3-  "agents message" (in the case of shares held in book-entry form) in
accordance with _Section 1.6_, (i) any dividends and other distributions in
accordance with  _Section 1.7_, (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration into
which such shares of Company Common Stock are converted and (iii) any cash,
without interest, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor.

Section 1.6 _Parent to Make Certificates Available_. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint BNY Mellon (or such other commercial
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as exchange
agent for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange
in accordance with this _Section 1.6_ through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as
the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ and cash, as
required, to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.8_ (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver out
of the Exchange Fund (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated to
be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)_ and (ii) the cash, as
required, to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.8_.

 

(b) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, to mail to each record holder of a
Certificate or Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall (i) specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, (ii) contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares and (iii) be in such
form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the Companys reasonable
approval) (the " _Transmittal Letter_ ")). Upon (x) in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (y) in the case of
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the
Transmittal Letter, duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of the Per Share
Merger Consideration into which the shares have been converted at the
Effective Time pursuant to  _Section 1.5(c)_, (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional share which the holder has a right to receive pursuant to _Section
1.8_ and (iii) certain dividends and other distributions in accordance with 
_Section 1.7_, and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid
or registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment or registration that the surrendered Certificate be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Per
Share Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
as a result of such payment or registration in the name of a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.6(b)_, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the

 



 

-4-  Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Sections 1.7_ and _1.8_
) upon such surrender. 

Section 1.7 _Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholding_. No dividends or other
distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent
Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the
Effective Time, will be paid to any Person entitled by reason of the Merger to
receive Parent Common Stock, until such Person surrenders the related
Certificate or Certificates (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form), as provided in _Section 1.6_, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares will be paid to any such Person pursuant to  _Section 1.8_
until such Person shall so surrender the related Certificate or Certificates
(or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form). Subject to the
effect of applicable Law, there shall be paid to each record holder of a new
certificate representing such Parent Common Stock: (i) at the time of such
surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock represented by such new certificate and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such
surrender; (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable
thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or
subsequent to such surrender and (iii) at the time of such surrender or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any cash payable with
respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.8_. In no event shall the Person entitled to
receive such dividends or other distributions or cash in lieu of fractional
shares be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other
distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares. Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of any such payment under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise
would have received the payment in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

 

Section 1.8 _No Fractional Securities_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this _Article I_ ; no Parent dividend
or other distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional share; and
no fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a securityholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share,
each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates
for exchange pursuant to this _Article I_ will be paid an amount in cash
(without interest), rounded down to the nearest cent, determined by
multiplying (i) the last reported sale price per share of Parent Common Stock
on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") on the last complete
trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time (or, if the shares of
Parent Common Stock do not trade on Nasdaq on such date, the first date of
trading of shares of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq after the Effective Time)
by (ii) the fractional interest of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment
of cash in lieu of fractional shares 



 

-5-  of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests, without interest, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
_Section 1.7_ and this _Section 1.8_.

 

Section 1.9 _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock for six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand
of Parent, and any such former holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Per Share Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this _Article I_. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common
Stock or any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends or
other distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or dividends and distributions which
are properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished with
the SEC since July 29, 2009 but prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-
looking in nature); _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosures in such
Parent SEC Documents that are the subject of this _clause (i)_ shall be
deemed to qualify a representation or warranty only if the relevance of such
disclosure to such representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that the disclosures in the
Parent SEC Documents shall not be deemed to qualify any representations or
warranties made in _Section 2.2(a)_ (this _clause (i)_ being referred to
herein as the " _Parent SEC Disclosure_ "), or (ii) in the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), which shall be arranged in
numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in this  _Article II_, and the disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
qualify other sections in this _Article II_ to the extent (and only to the
extent) that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections, Parent and
Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

 

Section 2.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of
Parent is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite
corporate (in the case of a Subsidiary that is a corporation) or other power
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are duly
qualified to do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of their properties owned or held under lease or the
nature of their activities makes such qualification or good standing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 2.2 _Capital Structure_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of 199,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of
Parent Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on June 7, 2010, (i)
146,517,252 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of
which were validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights; (ii) no shares of Parent Common Stock were held in



 

-9-  the treasury of Parent or by Subsidiaries of Parent; (iii) 3,114,419 shares
of Parent Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding

Parent were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement will be, when so issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. Except for awards granted under the Parent Stock Plans and
the Parent Stock Purchase Plan and for the Relationship Agreement, there are
no outstanding options to purchase or rights to otherwise acquire shares of
Parent Common Stock. Each share of Parent Common Stock which may be issued
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans and the Parent Stock Purchase Plan has been
duly authorized and, if and when issued pursuant to the terms thereof, will
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.
As of the date of this Agreement, except for (x) this Agreement and the
Relationship Agreement, (y) as contemplated by the Framework Agreement and
(z) as set forth above in this _Section 2.2(a)_, there are no outstanding
options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights, puts, convertible securities
or other similar Contracts to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a

grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, subscription, call,
right, put, convertible security or other similar Contract or (C) provide a
material amount of funds to, or make any material investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary. Parent does not
have any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on
any matter. Except for the Relationship Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Parent Voting Undertakings and as contemplated by the Framework Agreement,
there are no Contracts to which Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers or directors is a party concerning the voting of
any capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

director or qualifying shares, each such share (or other voting security or
equity equivalent, as the case may be) is owned by Parent or another
Subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, options, rights of first refusal, limitations on voting rights,

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by the effect of

(a) Parent has timely filed with the SEC all documents required to be filed by
it since January 1, 2008 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "

SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, at the respective
times they were filed, none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

included in the Parent SEC Documents complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance

ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents

period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
Parents managements most recently completed evaluation of Parents internal
control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) to

weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parents

that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal control over financial reporting.

Material Adverse Effect.

this Agreement or the Framework Agreement (either alone or in connection with
any other event) or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Framework Agreement.

Section 2.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Each Parent Plan is listed in _Section 2.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter. With respect to each Parent Plan, Parent has delivered or made
available to the Company a true and correct copy of (i) the three (3) most
recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the IRS; (ii) each such Parent
Plan that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto; (iii) each
trust, insurance or administrative Contract relating to each such Parent Plan;
(iv) the most recent summary plan description or, if no summary plan
description exists, such other written explanation of each Parent Plan as
provided to participants; (v) a written summary of each material unwritten
Parent Plan; (vi) the most recent determination letter, if any, issued by the
IRS with respect to any Parent Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code; and (vii) all correspondence with the IRS, the Department
of Labor, the SEC or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any
outstanding Parent Plan controversy or audit. Each Parent Plan complies
in all material respects with its terms, the Employee Income Retirement
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), the Code and all other
applicable Laws. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates currently maintains, contributes to or has any
liability under or, at any time during the past six (6) years has maintained
or contributed to, any pension plan which is subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA. None of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates currently maintains,
contributes to or has any liability under or, at any time during the past six
(6) years has maintained or contributed to, any multiemployer plan (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

(b) With respect to the Parent Plans, no event or set of circumstances has
occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection
with which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates or any Parent Plan fiduciary could be subject to any liability
under the terms of such Parent Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable
Law, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, other than liabilities for benefits payable in the normal
course. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened Action
relating to any Parent Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). All
Parent Plans that are intended by their terms to be, or are otherwise treated
by Parent as, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined
by the IRS to be so qualified, or a timely application for such determination
is now pending. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
or obligation under any plan or Contract to provide welfare benefits after
termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required
by Section 4980B of the Code or during any severance period. None of Parent,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any
liability for a failure to comply with Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA which would, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

that would be subject to taxation under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. No
individual is entitled to any additional payment from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries on account of any taxes incurred under Section 4999 or 409A of
the Code.

 

(e) With respect to each Parent Plan not subject to United States law (a "
_Parent Foreign Benefit Plan_ "), (i) the fair market value of the assets of
each funded Parent Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Parent Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance, or the reserve shown on
the consolidated financial statements of the Parent included in the Parent
SEC Documents for any unfunded Parent Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the projected
benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all current
and former participants in such plan based on reasonable, country-specific
actuarial assumptions and valuations, and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or the Framework Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations or book reserve to be less than such projected benefit
obligations and (ii) if such Parent Foreign Benefit Plan is required to be
registered, it has been registered and has been maintained in good standing
with the appropriate regulatory authorities.

(f) Parent, with respect to employees outside of the United States, (i) is not
under any legal liability to pay pensions, gratuities, superannuation

conditions related thereto, including those relating to the generation,
handling, disposal, transportation or release of hazardous materials
(collectively, " _Environmental Laws_ "), except, in each case, for any
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. With respect to such properties, assets and
operations, including any previously owned, leased or operated properties,
assets or operations, there are no events, conditions, circumstances,
activities, practices, incidents, actions or plans of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that may interfere with or prevent compliance or continued
compliance with applicable Worker Safety Laws and Environmental Laws, other

aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining Contract
or any labor Contract.



 

-19-  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any material
unfair labor practice or material violation of state or local labor wage and
hour or employment Laws with respect to any Persons employed by or otherwise
performing services primarily for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Parent Business Personnel_ "), and there is no unfair labor practice
complaint or grievance against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by the
National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state agency pending or
threatened in writing with respect to the Parent Business Personnel, except

Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries which may interfere with the respective business activities of

proprietary information and intellectual property rights (collectively, "
_Intellectual Property Rights_ ") as are necessary to conduct the business of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or planned to be conducted
by Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except where the failure
to have such Intellectual Property Rights would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates or
violates in any material respect any Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party, except where such infringement, misappropriation or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse

or to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except where such infringement,
misappropriation or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

to cover all of Parents and its Subsidiaries past and current use(s) of
such Intellectual Property Rights and those reasonably anticipated to be
needed in the businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except where
the failure to own such Intellectual Property Rights would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 2.17 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Parent has received the oral
opinion of UBS Securities LLC to be confirmed in writing (with a copy
provided solely for informational purposes to the Company promptly after

complete and correct copy of the Framework Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Framework Agreement has not been amended, supplemented or
modified, in any respect and (ii) except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law), the Framework
Agreement is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, Manchester and the other parties
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, the representations and warranties
of Parent set forth in Section 5 of the Framework Agreement are true and
correct in all material



 

-22-  respects. There are no conditions precedent related to the Coniston
Transaction, other than as set forth in the Framework Agreement. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any
term or condition of the Framework Agreement.

 

(b) _Section 2.23(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true,
complete and correct copies of the executed commitment letter, related term
sheet attached thereto, and the redacted fee letter (collectively, with the
fully executed fee letter, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ ") from J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, UBS
Securities LLC and UBS Loan Finance LLC (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "),
pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject only to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to provide or cause to be provided to Parent
debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for purposes of financing the
Coniston Transaction and related fees and expenses and the other purposes set
forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ").

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or that would permit the Lenders
to cancel or reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date of
this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing, if funded in accordance with the
Debt Financing Commitments, together with available cash, would provide Parent
with financing (i) on the Coniston Closing sufficient for Parent to complete
the Coniston Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses incurred by
Parent or for which Parent is responsible and (ii) on the closing of the
Contingent Repurchase sufficient for Parent to complete the Contingent
Repurchase and to pay related fees and expenses incurred by Parent or for
which Parent is responsible, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions contemplated hereby and thereby. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Debt Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, are legal, valid
and binding obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
Lenders, and (assuming that the Debt Financing Commitments constitutes such
obligation of the Lenders) is in full force and effect, except to the
extent enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at Law).

(d) Immediately following the Coniston Closing, Parent will be Solvent.
Immediately following the Closing and immediately following the Contingent
Repurchase Closing (if Manchester requires Parent to effect the Contingent
Repurchase in accordance with the Framework Agreement), the Combined Company
will be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " when used with
respect to Parent or the Combined Company, as applicable, means that, as of
any date of determination: (i) the assets of Parent or the Combined Company,
as the case may be, at a "fair valuation" will as of such date, exceed the
amount of all of its "liabilities of Parent or the Combined Company, as the
case may be, contingent or otherwise", as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors; (ii) the "present fair saleable
value" of the assets of Parent or the Combined Company, as the case may be,
will, as of such date, be greater than "the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability of Parent or the Combined Company, as the case may
be, on its existing debts as such debts become absolute and 



 

-23-  matured", as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors;
(iii) the remaining assets of Parent or the Combined Company, as the case may
be, as of such date, will not be "unreasonably small" nor constitute an
"unreasonably small capital" in relation to the business or transaction(s) in
which it is engaged or is about to engage, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations
of the insolvency of debtors; and (iv) Parent or the Combined Company, as the
case may be, will be able to pay its debts as they become due. For purposes
of this definition, (A) "debt" means liability on a "claim" and (B) "claim"
means any (1) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (2) right to
an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.

delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), which shall be arranged in
numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in this  _Article III_, and the disclosure of any item in

qualify other sections in this _Article III_ to the extent (and only to the

Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are duly

 



 

-24-  qualified to do business, and are in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of their properties owned or held under lease or the

or, if amended, as of the date of the last

 



 

-27-  amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, at the respective times they

of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in

periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations
and their consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the

other adjustments described therein). Except as required by GAAP, the Company

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are

(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial
and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by

evaluation. Based on the Companys managements most recently completed
evaluation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting prior
to the date of this Agreement, (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) the
Company does not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.

all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

of Labor, the SEC or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any
outstanding Company Plan controversy or audit. Each Company Plan complies in
all material respects with its terms, ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Laws. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates currently maintains, contributes to or has any liability
under or, at any time during the past six (6) years has maintained or

(b) With respect to the Company Plans, no event or set of circumstances has

Material Adverse Effect, other than liabilities for benefits payable in the
normal course. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Action relating to



 

-33-  any Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). All Company Plans
that are intended by their terms to be, or are otherwise treated by the
Company as, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined
by the IRS to be so qualified, or a timely application for such determination
is now pending. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability or obligation under any plan or Contract to provide welfare
benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other
than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or during any severance period.

in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

that would be subject to taxation under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. No
individual is entitled to any additional payment from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on account of any taxes incurred under Section 4999 or 409A
of the Code.

each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance, or the reserve
shown on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents for any unfunded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
projected benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan based on reasonable, country-
specific actuarial assumptions and valuations, and no transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book
reserve to be less than such projected benefit obligations and (ii) if such
Company Foreign Benefit Plan is required to be registered, it has been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with the applicable
regulatory authorities.

(f) The Company, with respect to employees outside of the United States, (i)

circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions or plans of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may interfere with or prevent

Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or

pursuant to _Sections 5.5(b)_ or _5.5(d)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Sections 5.5(c)_ , _5.5(e)_ or _5.5(f)_ and, in order

applicable, for any of the amounts set forth in _Sections 5.5(b)_ , _5.5(c)_ ,
_5.5(d)_ , _5.5(e)_ or _5.5(f)_ , as applicable, the Company shall pay to the

references in such definition to "20%" and "80%" shall be replaced by "50%"
(including with respect to the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" for
purposes of this  _Section 5.5_) and "Parent Acquisition Transaction" shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Article IX_ , except that references in
such definition to "20%," "35%" and "80%" shall be replaced by "50%"

Section 5.6 _Company Stock Plans and Company Stock Purchase Plan_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
shall become and represent an option to purchase the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Substitute Option_ ") (decreased to the nearest full
share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. After the Effective
Time, except as provided above in this _Section 5.6_, each Substitute Option
shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Company Stock Option immediately prior to or at the Effective Time,
subject to any acceleration, lapse or other vesting occurring by operation of
the Merger (either alone or in connection with any other event). Parent and
the Company shall take all necessary action to implement and make effective
the provisions of this _Section 5.6_.

Company Shares in the Merger shall continue to be unvested and subject to the
same Unvested Share Restrictions which applied to such Unvested Company
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any acceleration,
lapse or

 



 

-55-  other vesting occurring by operation of the Merger (either alone or in
connection with any other event). The certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock shall accordingly be marked with appropriate legends
noting such Unvested Share Restrictions. Parent and the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
(or its assignee) shall be entitled to exercise the rights held by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to all Unvested
Share Restrictions.

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Stock Unit shall be adjusted and be
converted into a right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Stock Unit, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. After the Effective
Time, except as provided above in this _Section 5.6(c)_, each Stock Unit
shall be subject to the Stock Unit Terms effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any payment, calculation, acceleration, lapse,
vesting or other impact occurring by operation of the Merger (either alone or
in connection with any other event). Parent and the Company shall take all
necessary action to implement and make effective the provisions of this
_Section 5.6(c)_.

(d) The Company shall cause, and shall amend the Company Stock Purchase
Plan as may be necessary to permit: (i) no new Plan Period (as defined in the
Company Stock Purchase Plan) to commence after the date of this Agreement;
(ii) all options under the Company Stock Purchase Plan outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement to be exercised, to the extent of any accumulated
payroll deductions as of the exercise date, on the last Business Day of the

cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger, the Coniston Transaction (in the case of Parent) and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in the case of
Parent, the Framework Agreement, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all commercially

be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity; (iii) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,

after the date hereof make their respective filings and thereafter make any
other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other in (A) determining whether any filings

with any filings made pursuant hereto and (B) any request by any officials of
any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made

any Law. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made with any Governmental Entity
pursuant hereto, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly
inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. The Company and
Parent shall permit counsel for the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the view of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental

by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate.

(c) Except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, each party shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to not take any action, or enter into any
transaction, which would cause any of its representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or result in a breach of any
covenant made by it in this Agreement.

(d) To the extent necessary in order to accomplish the objectives described

or operation by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of
any portion of the business, properties or assets of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ ; _however_ , that neither
Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall offer,
take, commit to or accept any action, restrictions or limitations of or on
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the other party if such action, restriction or limitation,
individually or in the aggregate would, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in a Substantial Detriment.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will not issue any
press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such
transactions without prior consultation



  

-57-  with the other party, except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or the rules of Nasdaq.

 

Section 5.9 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Laws shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company
and their respective Boards of Directors shall use their commercially

contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent
and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former

Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws or other organizational documents or in any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of no less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiarys certificate
of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents in effect as
of the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers
or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Action. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand
surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor and perform, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 5.10_.

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) each current and
former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such individuals heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any Losses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification) in connection with
any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time. No
Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Action for which indemnification could be
sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless 



 

-58-  Parent consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) cause to be
obtained a "tail" insurance policy with respect to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance as in effect as of the Effective Time (a " _D andO Tail
Policy_"), which DandO Tail Policy (A) shall have a claims period of at least
six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
Indemnified Parties covered by the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as of the
Effective Time and (B) shall contain terms with respect to scope of coverage
and amount no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in the Companys
and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance policies as of the Effective Time, or (ii)
maintain the existing officers and directors liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided
that Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to substitute therefor
policies of at least the same scope of coverage and amount and containing
terms and conditions that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
Indemnified Parties) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time so
long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the existing officers and directors liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies expire, are terminated or cancelled during such six
(6)-year period or require an annual premium in excess of 300% of the current
premium paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Company s Current
Premium_"), then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain
during each year of such six year period as much coverage as can be obtained
for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess of 300% (on an
annualized basis) of the Companys Current Premium. In lieu of the foregoing,
the Company may purchase, prior to, on or after the Effective Time, a six-
year prepaid DandO Tail Policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time covering each of the Indemnified Parties. _Section
5.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the Companys Current
Premium.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in seeking in good faith
to enforce the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
5.10_ (subject to reimbursement if a court of competent jurisdiction
subsequently determines pursuant to a non-appealable order that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this _Section
5.10_).

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all

 



 

-59-  or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and
in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

Section 5.11  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to
Parent, of: (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which it is aware and which would be
reasonably likely to cause (x) any representation or warranty of the notifying
party contained in this Agreement (or the Framework Agreement in the case of
Parent) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any
covenant, condition or agreement of the notifying party contained in this
Agreement (or the Framework Agreement in the case of Parent) not to be
complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any failure of the
notifying party to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder (or
under the Framework Agreement in the case of Parent) or (iii) any
Circumstances which would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, on the notifying party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

 

Section 5.12 _Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements_. Parent agrees that it
will cause the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time to
assume and honor all Company Plans and Company Employee Agreements entered
into by the Company prior to the date hereof and all Company Stock Plans.
Parent further agrees that all employees of the Company who remain in
the active employment of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") shall continue in their existing Company Plans following the
Effective Time until such time as, in Parents sole discretion, an orderly
transition can be accomplished to other employee benefit plans and programs
maintained by Parent or Surviving Corporation for employees; provided that, in
any event, for a period of at least twelve (12) months from the Closing Date,
the Continuing Employees shall receive employee benefits at least
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to either (i) the employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or (ii) the employee
benefits provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in either case equity-based compensation shall be granted
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans and in accordance with Parents policies
and procedures. Such employee benefits shall be provided without any
preexisting conditions limitations or exclusions to the extent no such
limitations or exclusions applied as of the Closing to the Continuing
Employees under the plans of the Company in which such employees participate
immediately prior to the Closing Date and with credit for all annual
deductibles and co-payments made under Company employee benefit plans for the
covered expenses already incurred by the Continuing Employees for the year in
which the Closing occurs. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide
the Continuing Employees with credit for all service with the Company under
all applicable employee benefit plans, programs and policies, including for
purposes of eligibility, waiting periods and vesting (but not benefit
accruals other than for vacation and severance) to the same extent such
service would have been recognized by the Company under comparable plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent such treatment
would result in duplicative benefits. Subject to the foregoing provisions of
this



 

-60-   _Section 5.12_, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting
the power of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any
specific Company Plan or Company Stock Plan or any other individual employee
benefit plan, program, Contract or policy or as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to offer to continue (other than as required by its
terms) any Company Employee Agreement, except that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not terminate the 2010 Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan
for Eligible Company Employees or the 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan for
Specified Officers (together, the " _Company Bonus Plans_ ") prior to payment
of bonuses earned thereunder for 2010; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, (x) the Company Bonus Plans will be
modified to take into account costs and other consequences of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and potential loss, if any,
of an income tax deduction under 162(m) of the Code resulting from any such
modification, and (y) the Company and Parent will cooperate in good faith to
develop prior to the Closing Date appropriate revisions to performance goals
and/or performance levels and/or measures under the Company Bonus Plans for
2010 that reflect a commercially reasonable approach in providing the
incentive compensation awards intended under the Company Bonus Plans. Nothing
in this Agreement shall be interpreted as an amendment or other modification
of any Company Plan or any Parent Plan or any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement or the establishment of any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any Continuing Employee or any other employee of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or to restrict the right of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate or cause to be terminated the employment of any employee at any time
for any or no reason with or without notice. Parent and the Company
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 5.12_
are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, and that nothing in
this _Section 5.12_, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person, including any
employees, former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Parent,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (B) to continued employment with Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or continued
participation in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement.

Section 5.13 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. During the period from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
Termination Date, unless the other party shall otherwise agree in writing,
neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each of Parent and the Company
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, take or fail to take any
action which action or failure would be contrary to the representations in the
Parent Tax Certificate or the Company Tax Certificate, as the case may be, or
to take any action or fail to take any action which would, to its knowledge,
jeopardize the Intended Tax Treatment.

its respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees
and Representatives to cooperate in the defense of such litigation.

 

Section 5.18 _Coniston Transaction_. (a) Parent shall deliver the Launch
Demand in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, Section 2.2(e) of the

therewith to the extent commercially reasonable, (B) without the consent of
the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Parent shall not agree to any material amendment or modification to
the Debt Financing Commitments, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
thereunder, if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy adds new (or
adversely modifies existing) conditions to the consummation of the financings
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or reduces the aggregate amount
of such financing in any material respect (without a corresponding increase
in another portion of such financing); _provided_ that Parent may amend or
modify the Debt Financing Commitments (1) to add lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents or similar entities that had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof or (2) otherwise so long as
the terms would not, taken as a whole, adversely impact the ability of Parent
to consummate the transactions 



 

-64-  contemplated by the Framework Agreement, (C) if any portion of the financing
under the Debt Financing Commitments becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the unavailable portion of
such financing to be provided from alternative sources as promptly as
practicable in an amount sufficient to consummate the Coniston Transactions

terms that, taken as a whole, are less favorable to Parent in any material
respect than those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments and (D)
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably and promptly informed with respect to
all material activity concerning the status of the financing contemplated by

reason, (y) the Lenders notify Parent that they no longer intend to provide

to Parent on the terms set forth therein or (z) for any reason Parent no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on
the terms described therein. Except for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), enter into any
transaction, including any merger, acquisition, Joint Venture, disposition,
lease, Contract or debt or equity financing, which transaction at the time of
such transaction is reasonably expected to materially impair, delay or prevent
consummation of the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments.

 

(c) In the event of _clause (y)_ of _Section 5.18(b)_, until the Effective
Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.1_, (i) Parent shall notify the Company promptly and (ii) Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any

proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments or any
Alternative Financing commitments, as promptly as practicable but in any
event on or before the Outside Date, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") (A) on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative
Financing commitments or (B) on other terms and conditions that (1) are no
less favorable in any material respect to Parent and Merger Sub taken as a
whole than those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (2) do not
impose any new or additional conditions or adversely

 



 

-65-  change any existing conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing as set
