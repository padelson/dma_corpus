C-COR, ARRIS, and the Merger Subsidiary are herein referred to collectively as the " _Parties_ " and each individually as a " _Party_." 

  

W I T N E S S E T H 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of C-COR, ARRIS and the Merger Subsidiary have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders that C-COR, ARRIS and the Merger Subsidiary enter into a business combination under which C-COR will merge with and into the Merger Subsidiary (the " _Merger_ ") and, in connection therewith, to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of C-COR, ARRIS and the Merger Subsidiary have determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals and have each adopted and approved this Agreement and the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall constitute a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 SECTION 1.1  _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (" _Pennsylvania Law_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _Delaware Law_ "), the Merger shall be consummated, whereby C-COR shall be merged with and into the Merger Subsidiary, the separate corporate existence of C-COR shall cease, and the Merger Subsidiary shall continue as the surviving corporation, which shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of ARRIS. The Merger Subsidiary as the surviving corporation after the Merger is herein sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ," and C-COR as the non-surviving corporation after the Merger is herein sometimes referred to as the " _Merged Corporation_." 

  

 SECTION 1.2  _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof and the consummation of the Closing 

   #####

") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the
Merger, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of Pennsylvania Law and Delaware Law, as applicable (the
time of such filing being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.3  _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania Law and Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of C-COR and the Merger Subsidiary shall continue with, or vest in, as the case may be, the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of C-COR and the Merger Subsidiary shall continue to be, or become, as the case may be, the debts, liabilities and duties of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ARRIS. 

  

 SECTION 1.4  _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to continue in, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of either of its constituent corporations acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be directed and authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of such constituent corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 1.5  _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise agreed by C-COR and ARRIS before the Effective Time, at the Effective Time: 

  

 (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation, except that the name of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to " _C-COR Incorporated_ ;" 

  

 (b) the Bylaws of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation and such Bylaws; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) the directors of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to serve as directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of C-COR immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to serve in their respective offices as officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, in each case until their successors are elected or appointed or until their resignation or removal. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist in any office of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided by Delaware Law and the Bylaws of the Merger Subsidiary as the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECT ON STOCK OF THE SURVIVING 
 CORPORATION AND THE MERGED CORPORATION  

  

 SECTION 2.1  _Conversion of Securities_. The manner and basis of converting the shares of common stock of the Merged Corporation at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any of such securities, shall be as hereinafter set forth in this Article II. 

  

 SECTION 2.2 _ Conversion of Shares_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 2.3, each share of C-COR Common Stock (as defined herein) issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (excluding those held in the treasury of C-COR and those owned by ARRIS, referred to herein as the " _Excluded C-COR Shares_ ") and all rights in respect thereof, shall at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of any holder thereof, forthwith cease to exist and be converted into and become exchangeable, at the election of the holder thereof: (i) for each share of C-COR Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.5 (a " _Cash Election_ "), the right to receive in cash from ARRIS, without interest, an amount equal to $13.75 (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (collectively, " _Cash Election Shares_ "); (ii) for each share of C-COR Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive ARRIS Common Stock (as defined herein) has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.5 (a " _Stock Election_ "), the right to receive from ARRIS a portion of a share of ARRIS Common Stock equal to 0.9642 of a share, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.2(b) below, (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of ARRIS Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.2(b) (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "); and (iii) for each share of C-COR Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.5 (" _Non-Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from ARRIS such Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 2.3(b). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration_ " with respect to a given share of C-COR Common Stock shall mean either the Cash Consideration (with respect to a share of C-COR Common Stock representing the right to receive the Cash Consideration) or the Stock Consideration (with respect to a share of C-COR Common Stock representing the right to receive the Stock Consideration). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In the event that the average closing price of the ARRIS Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ ) for the ten trading-day period ending the third trading day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Average Trading Price_ ") is less than $12.83 (a " _Decrease Event_ ") then ARRIS shall increase the amount of the Stock Consideration, which increase in the Stock Consideration, at ARRIS election by notice to the Exchange Agent and C-COR, may be paid as cash or additional shares of ARRIS Common Stock, such that the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration paid per share of C-COR Common Stock for all outstanding shares of C-COR Common Stock (other than Excluded C-COR Shares), calculated using the Average Trading Price (solely for purposes of determining the value of the shares of ARRIS Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration), equals $13.08. If the Average Trading Price is more than $15.69 (an " _Increase Event_ "), then ARRIS shall decrease the amount of the Stock Consideration such that the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration paid per share of C-COR Common Stock for all outstanding shares of C-COR Common Stock (other than Excluded C-COR Shares), calculated using the Average Trading Price (solely for purposes of determining the value of the shares of ARRIS Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration), equals $14.43. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in making the adjustments to the Merger Consideration set forth in this Section 2.2(b), (i) ARRIS shall not be required to use an Average Trading Price of less than $11.41 or more than $17.11, and (ii) in the event of a Decrease Event, ARRIS shall not elect to pay such increase in cash to the extent that such increase in cash would result in counsel to C-COR or counsel to ARRIS being unable to deliver its opinion contemplated by Sections 8.2(d) or 8.3(d), respectively. 

  

 (c) Commencing immediately after the Effective Time, each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of C-COR Common Stock (" _C-COR Shares_ ") shall evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration on the basis hereinbefore set forth, but subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II. 

  

 (d) For all purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, all C-COR Shares held by retirement plans of C-COR subject to the requirements under Section 401(a) of the Code and all C-COR Shares held in non-qualified plans of C-COR (the " _C-COR Retirement Plan Shares_ ") (i) shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding, (ii) shall not be deemed to be held in the treasury of C-COR and (iii) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that all such C-COR Retirement Plan Shares shall be deemed Non-Election Shares for purposes of this Article II. 

  

 SECTION 2.3  _Allocation of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement and subject to ARRISs rights under Section 2.3(b) to increase the Stock Consideration by adding cash instead of ARRIS Common Stock, (i) the number of shares of C-COR Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of C-COR Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) 0.4909 and (ii) all of the other shares of C-COR Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into Cash Consideration (in case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), excluding the Excluded C-COR Shares).

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline (as defined herein) and in any event no more than five business days after the Closing Date (or such other date as C-COR and ARRIS shall agree), ARRIS shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among holders of C-COR Common Stock (other than Excluded C-COR Shares) of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: 

   

 (i) If the aggregate number of C-COR Shares with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares of such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. 

  

 SECTION 2.4  _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Except as provided in Section 2.2(d), at the Effective Time, each share of C-COR Common Stock held in the treasury of C-COR or owned by ARRIS immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and no shares of stock or other securities of ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation shall be issuable, and no payment or other consideration shall be made, with respect thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.5  _Election of Merger Consideration and Exchange of Shares_. Each holder of record of C-COR Common Stock (other than (i) Excluded C-COR Shares and (ii) C-COR Retirement Plan Shares) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: 

  

 (a) Each holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5 (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of C-COR Shares owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of C-COR Shares owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a Cash Election. 

  

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at or prior to the Effective Time, ARRIS and C-COR shall jointly appoint an exchange agent to effect the exchange of C-COR Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of this Article II (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, ARRIS shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash and certificates representing ARRIS Common Stock sufficient to pay all amounts for conversion of C-COR Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 hereof, it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be turned over to ARRIS. Commencing immediately after the Effective Time and until the appointment of the Exchange Agent shall be terminated, each holder of a certificate or certificates theretofore representing C-COR Shares may surrender the same to the Exchange Agent, and, after the appointment of the Exchange Agent shall be terminated, any such holder may surrender any such certificate to ARRIS. Each holder shall be entitled upon such surrender to receive in exchange therefor the Cash Consideration and a certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of the Stock Consideration into which the C-COR Shares theretofore represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall have been converted in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 hereof, together with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 2.7 hereof. All such shares of ARRIS Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration shall be issued at the Effective Time. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding C-COR Shares shall be for all corporate purposes of ARRIS, other than the payment of dividends and other distributions, if any, to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Unless and until any such certificate theretofore representing C-COR Shares is so surrendered, no dividend or other distribution, if any, payable to the holders of record of ARRIS Common Stock as of any date subsequent to the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of such certificate in respect thereof. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6 hereof, upon the surrender of any such certificate theretofore representing C-COR Shares, however, the record holder of the certificate or certificates representing shares of ARRIS Common Stock issued in exchange therefor shall receive from the Exchange Agent or from ARRIS, as the case may be, payment of the amount of dividends and other distributions, if any, that as of any date subsequent to the Effective Time and until such surrender shall have become payable with respect to such number of shares of ARRIS Common Stock (" _Pre-Surrender Dividends_ "). No interest shall be payable with respect to the payment of Pre-Surrender Dividends upon the surrender of certificates theretofore representing C-COR Shares. After the appointment of the Exchange Agent shall have been terminated, any holders of certificates representing C-COR Shares which have not received payment of Pre-Surrender Dividends shall look only to ARRIS for payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 2.5(b), neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be liable to a
holder of C-COR Shares for any Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration, any
dividends or distributions thereon or any cash payment for fractional shares
as contemplated by Section 2.7, delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law or to a
transferee. 

  

 (c) ARRIS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the shareholders of C-COR entitled to vote at the C-COR Stockholders Meeting (as defined herein), at the time that the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is provided to the stockholders of C-COR, a form reasonably acceptable to C-COR (the " _Form of Election_ ") pursuant to which C-CORs stockholders shall be entitled to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline (as defined herein), and shall cause the Exchange Agent to use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of C-COR who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Form of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event shall the initial mailing of the Form of Election to C-CORs stockholders be made less than 20 days prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to act as Exchange Agent under this Agreement, shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed. As used herein, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the date that is the business day prior to the date of the C-COR Stockholders Meeting (or at such other date and time as C-COR and ARRIS shall agree). ARRIS and C-COR shall cooperate to issue a press release announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen business days before, and at least five business days prior to, the Election Deadline (and, if C-COR and ARRIS shall agree to any extension thereof, C-COR and ARRIS shall make a public announcement of any such extension as far as reasonably practicable prior to such new Election Deadline). 

  

 (e) If ARRIS shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any C-COR Shares, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, thereafter timely filed. Any stockholder of C-COR may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised Form of Election. Any stockholder of C-COR may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. 

  

 (f) Each of the Exchange Agent, ARRIS and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of C-COR Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign law related to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or ARRIS, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) will be remitted by ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable governmental entity, and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the share of C-COR Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or ARRIS, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) If any certificate formerly representing C-COR Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by ARRIS, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as ARRIS may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of C-COR Shares represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.5. 

  

 SECTION 2.6  _Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of C-COR shall be closed at the Effective Time and no transfer of any C-COR Shares will thereafter be recorded on any of such stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of ownership of C-COR Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer records of C-COR at the Effective Time, cash and a certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of ARRIS Common Stock into which such C-COR Shares shall have been converted shall be issued to the transferee together with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, in accordance with Section 2.7 hereof, and a cash payment in the amount of Pre-Surrender Dividends, if any, in accordance with Section 2.5(b) hereof, if the certificate or certificates representing such C-COR Shares is or are surrendered as provided in Section 2.5 hereof, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence of payment of any applicable stock transfer tax. 

  

 SECTION 2.7  _No Fractional Share Certificates_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of C-COR Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of ARRIS Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of ARRIS Common Stock multiplied by the Average Trading Price. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any fractional shares. 

  

 SECTION 2.8  _Options to Purchase C-COR Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by C-COR to purchase shares of C-COR Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Assumed Equity Awards_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by ARRIS and converted into an option or warrant to purchase shares of ARRIS Common Stock in such amount and at such exercise price as provided below and otherwise having the same terms, conditions and restrictions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent that such terms, conditions and restrictions may be altered in accordance with their terms as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby): 

   

 (i) the number of shares of ARRIS Common Stock to be subject to the new option or warrant shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of C-COR Common Stock subject to the original option or warrant multiplied by (y) 0.9642 (the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole share; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in the event of a Decrease Event under Section 2.2(b), the Option Exchange Ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $13.08 by the Average Trading Price, and (B) in the event of an Increase Event under Section 2.2(b), the Option Exchange 

   ##### 

  

    

Ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing $14.43 by the Average Trading
Price, in the case of either (A) or (B), rounded down to the nearest whole
share; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that ARRIS shall not be required to use an
Average Trading Price of less than $11.41 or more than $17.11; and 

   

 (ii) the exercise price per share of ARRIS Common Stock under the new option or warrant shall be equal to the result of (x) the exercise price per share of the C-COR Common Stock under the original option or warrant divided by (y) the applicable Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. 

  

 (b) For purposes of Section 4(b) of the C-COR Amended and Restated Incentive Plan (the " _Incentive Plan_ "), the provisions of Section 2.8(a) constitute an adjustment in the number and option price of shares subject to, and the consideration to be issued upon the exercise of, outstanding Options (as defined in the Incentive Plan), as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors of C-COR, as of the Effective Time, and no further action or amendment of the Incentive Plan shall be necessary to implement such adjustment. 

  

 (c) The adjustments provided herein shall, to the extent applicable, be effected in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the Code so as not to be treated as new grants or awards or as a change in the form of payment, and with respect to any options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (d) ARRIS shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of ARRIS Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Assumed Equity Awards assumed in accordance with this Section 2.8. Within ten (10) business days following the Effective Time, ARRIS shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to ARRIS Common Stock subject to such Assumed Equity Awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Assumed Equity Awards remain outstanding. 

  

 (e) As of the Effective Time, ARRIS shall assume the obligations and succeed to the rights of C-COR under the Incentive Plan with respect to the Assumed Equity Awards. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, each warrant granted by C-COR to purchase shares of C-COR Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and no shares of stock or other securities of ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation shall be issuable, and no payment or other consideration shall be made with respect thereto. C-COR will take all steps reasonably necessary to notify the holders of such warrants of the anticipated Effective Time as required by the applicable warrant agreements. 

  

 SECTION 2.9  _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of C-COR Common Stock awarded pursuant to any plan, arrangement or transaction, and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as fully vested and shall be exchanged in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof with respect to such percentage of such award equal to the 

   ##### 

  

    

percentage of the applicable restriction period for such award that has
elapsed as of the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 2.10  _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of C-COR Common Stock or of ARRIS Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, the Exchange Ratio and Option Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of C-COR Common Stock and ARRIS Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or dividend. 

  

 SECTION 2.11  _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. C-COR shall take all actions with respect to the 1992 Stock Purchase Plan (the " _1992 SPP_ ") as are necessary to assure that (i) the 1992 SPP shall be suspended as soon as permitted by the terms of the 1992 SPP and (ii) there shall not be any additional Offering Period (as defined in the 1992 SPP) following the date of this Agreement.

The C-COR Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article IV. Unless otherwise stated therein, if the disclosure of any paragraph lists an item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required in another paragraph reasonably apparent on its face, such disclosure shall qualify and apply to the other paragraph.

carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure
to be in good standing or to have such Approvals would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each of C-COR and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or

A true and complete list of all of C-CORs Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of each

All shares of C-COR Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions 

   #####

The Board of Directors of C-COR has determined that the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of C-CORs stockholders. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by C-COR and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by ARRIS and the Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of C-COR enforceable against C-COR in accordance with its terms.

or encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of C-COR or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,

file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. 

  

 (b) Except as disclosed in Section 4.7(b) of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the C-COR SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of C-COR and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be, material in amount. 

  

 (c) C-COR has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to C-COR and its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by C-COR in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to C-CORs principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of C-COR required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _Sarbanes-Oxley_ ") with respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley. 

  

 (d) C-COR has established and maintains a "system of internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (" _internal controls_ "). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of C-CORs financial reporting and the preparation of C-CORs financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (as defined herein). C-COR has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to C-CORs auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to C-COR in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect C-CORs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information 

   ##### 

  

    

and (ii) any material fraud known to C-COR that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls. C-COR has made
available to ARRIS a summary of any such disclosure regarding material
weaknesses and fraud made by management to C-CORs auditors and audit
committee since July 1, 2005. For purposes of this Agreement, a "significant
deficiency" in controls means an internal control deficiency that adversely
affects an entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or
report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A
"significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of
deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than
inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal controls means a significant
deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in
more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

 (g) To the knowledge of C-COR, except as set forth in Section 4.21(g)-1 of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Owned Intellectual Property.

C-COR Software was developed either by (i) employees of C-COR or its Subsidiaries within the scope of their employment who have executed enforceable confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements, which are with or have been assigned to C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) independent contractors who have assigned their rights to C-COR or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to enforceable written agreements or (iii) acquired pursuant to an enforceable written agreement or assignment.

 (i) Except as set forth on Section 4.21(i)-1 of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, all material Trademarks of C-COR and its Subsidiaries within the Owned Intellectual Property and currently used in the operation of the business of C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries have been in continuous use by C-COR or a Subsidiary of C-COR, as applicable, since the date of their initial use in commerce.

 (j) The Copyrights within the Owned Intellectual Property have been solely (i) created by (A) employees of C-COR and its Subsidiaries within the scope of their employment who have executed the confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreement set forth in Section 4.21(h)-2 of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, or (B) independent contractors who have

as defined under Section 101 of the United States Copyright Act, or pursuant
to enforceable written agreements, or (ii) acquired pursuant to an
enforceable written assignment from the original author(s) or subsequent
assignees. To the knowledge of C-COR, the works covered by such
Copyrights were not copies of, nor derived from, any work for which C-COR or
any of its Subsidiaries does not own the Copyrights. To the knowledge of
C-COR, no other person has any claim to authorship or ownership of any part
of any of the Copyrights within the Owned Intellectual Property.

 (l) C-COR and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to protect their respective rights in material confidential information and trade secrets owned by them or disclosed to them by a third party and used in connection with the conduct of C-CORs business. Without limiting the foregoing, C-COR and its Subsidiaries have enforced a policy of requiring each employee, consultant and contractor to execute proprietary information, invention assignment and confidentiality agreements, as appropriate, substantially consistent with C-CORs standard forms (complete and current copies of which have been delivered or made available to ARRIS). Except under valid and binding confidentiality obligations, there has been no material disclosure by C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries to a third party of any confidential information or trade secrets used in connection with the conduct of C-CORs business. 

  

 (m) C-COR and its Subsidiaries have valid registrations for each of the domain names set forth in Section 4.21(a) of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule. The registration of each such domain name is free and clear of all liens and is in full force and effect. C-COR has paid all fees required to maintain each such registration. Neither C-COR nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any claim asserted against C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries adverse to its rights to such domain names, and, to the knowledge of C-COR, none of C-CORs registrations or uses of the domain names has been disturbed or placed "on hold."

currently employed by C-COR. Except for any components of the source code
licensed in from third parties, C-COR has actual and sole possession of the
complete source code of C-COR Software. Except as set forth on Section
4.21(n) of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, other than C-CORs or any of its
Subsidiaries delivery of C-COR source code to third party escrow agents or
their disclosure of such source code to third parties as part of a software
development kit made available by C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business, no event has occurred, and to the knowledge
of C-COR no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or
lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the
disclosure or delivery to any third party of the source code for C-COR
Software. C-COR Software (as used or distributed by C-COR or
its Subsidiaries) does not contain any "back door," "time bomb," "Trojan
horse," "worm," "drop dead device," "virus" (as these terms are commonly used
in the computer software industry), or other Software routines or hardware
components intentionally designed to permit unauthorized access, to disrupt,
disable or erase software, hardware or data, or to perform any other similar
type of unauthorized activities. 

  

 (o) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(o) of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, none of C-COR Software or any Owned Intellectual Property are, in whole or in part, subject to the provision of any open source or other similar type of license agreement or distribution model that (i) requires the distribution or making available of the source code for C-COR Software to the general public, (ii) prohibits or limits C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries from charging a fee or receiving consideration in connection with sublicensing or distributing any C-COR Software, (iii) except as specifically permitted by law, grants any right to any third party (other than C-COR and its Subsidiaries) or otherwise allows any such third party to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer any C-COR Software, or (iv) requires the licensing of any C-COR Software to the general public for the purpose of permitting others to make derivative works of C-COR Software (any such open source or other type of license agreement or distribution model described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, a " _Limited License_ ").

Except as disclosed in Section 5.7 of the ARRIS Disclosure Schedule, the ARRIS SEC Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the ARRIS Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. 

  

 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the ARRIS SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of ARRIS and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial 

   ##### 

  

    

statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which were not. or are not expected to be, material in amount. 

  

 (c) ARRIS has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to ARRIS and its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by ARRIS in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to ARRIS principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of ARRIS required by Sarbanes-Oxley with respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley. 

  

 (d) ARRIS has established and maintains a "system of internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (" _internal controls_ "). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ARRIS financial reporting and the preparation of ARRIS financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. ARRIS has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to ARRIS auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to ARRIS in the design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect ARRIS ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any material fraud known to ARRIS that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal controls. ARRIS has made available to C-COR a summary of any such disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to ARRIS auditors and audit committee since December 31, 2004. For purposes of this Agreement, a "significant deficiency" in controls means an internal control deficiency that adversely affects an entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A "significant deficiency" may be a single deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal controls means a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

 SECTION 6.2  _No Solicitation by C-COR_. 

  

 (a) C-COR shall not, nor shall it permit or authorize any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, accountant, counsel, financial advisor, agent or other representative of C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _C-COR Representatives_ ") to, on its or any of its Subsidiaries behalf, directly or indirectly, 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate, respond to or encourage, including by way of furnishing non-public information, any inquiries regarding or relating to, or the submission of, any Takeover Proposal (as defined below), 

   

 (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, furnish to any person any information or data relating to C-COR or its Subsidiaries, provide access to any of the properties, books, records or employees of C-COR or its Subsidiaries or take any other action, in each such case regarding or to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, 

   

 (iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement or commitment with respect to any Takeover Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or agree to, approve, endorse or resolve to recommend or approve any Takeover Proposal, except in each case as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.2(b), 

   

 (iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement by any third party who has made a Takeover Proposal, 

   

 (v) take any action to exempt any third party from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Subchapters "C" through "J" of Chapter 25 of Pennsylvania Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or 

   

 (vi) authorize or direct any C-COR Representative to take any such action; 

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.2(a) or any
other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit C-COR or the Board of
Directors of C-COR from (A) taking and disclosing to C-CORs stockholders a
position required by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) making such disclosure to
C-CORs stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of C-COR, after receiving advice from its outside counsel and its financial
advisors, C-COR is required under Pennsylvania Law in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties, or (C) notifying any third party solely of
the existence of, and restrictions under, the provisions of this Section 6.2,
provided that C-COR may not, except as permitted by Section 6.2(b), withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its approval or recommendation
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal, or enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Upon
execution of this Agreement, C-COR shall, and it shall cause C-COR
Representatives and its Subsidiaries to, immediately terminate any existing
activities, discussions, solicitations or negotiations with any third party
conducted previously with respect to any Takeover Proposal and, if requested
by ARRIS, to request the return and/or destruction of any materials
previously provided in connection with any such activities, discussions,
solicitations or negotiations. 

   

 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing restrictions set forth in Section 6.1 or this Section 6.2(a), nothing in this Agreement prevents C-COR or the Board of Directors of C-COR from furnishing (or causing to be furnished), prior to, but not after, the time the vote is taken with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger at the
Meeting of the stockholders of C-COR, information concerning its business,
properties or assets to any third party pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined herein), so long as such information is
contemporaneously provided to ARRIS, and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such third party who has made a bona fide,
written Takeover Proposal, _but only if_ : (w) such Takeover Proposal was
made after the date of this Agreement (it being understood that such
a Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement by a third party
who has made a Takeover Proposal prior to the date of this Agreement is
considered a new Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement);
(x) none of C-COR, its Subsidiaries nor the C-COR Representatives
has solicited, initiated, or knowingly facilitated or encouraged any Takeover
Proposal, or otherwise directly or indirectly violated this Section 6.2
(other than unintentional breaches that (1) have not directly or indirectly
resulted in the making of such Takeover Proposal and (2) otherwise have had
only an immaterial impact on ARRIS rights under this Section 6.2); (y) such
third party has submitted a Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of
C-COR has determined, after receiving advice from its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, either (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) or (ii) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;
and (z) the Board of Directors of C-COR determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from its outside counsel and its financial advisors, that
such action is required to discharge the Board of Directors of C-CORs
fiduciary duties to C-CORs stockholders under Pennsylvania Law. C-COR
shall not release or permit the release of any third party from, or waive or
permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill (other
than to permit the making of a Takeover Proposal) or similar agreement to
which C-COR is a party or under which C-COR has any rights. C-COR shall
promptly (and in any event within one business day) notify ARRIS
telephonically and in writing of the existence of any proposal, discussion,
negotiation or inquiry received by C-COR that is or could reasonably be
expected to constitute or lead to a Takeover Proposal, and C-COR
shall promptly communicate in writing to ARRIS the terms and conditions of
any such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may receive,
and provide a copy of any written proposal (to the extent permissible by the
terms thereof) and the identity of the third party making the same.
C-COR shall inform ARRIS within one business day after any change to the
material terms of any such Takeover Proposal. Within one business day after
any determination by the C-COR Board that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, C-COR shall deliver to ARRIS and Merger Subsidiary a
written notice advising them of such determination, specifying the terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party
making such Superior Proposal, and providing ARRIS and Merger Subsidiary with
a copy of the Superior Proposal to the extent permissible by the terms
thereof. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of C-COR nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to ARRIS or Merger Subsidiary, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of C-COR, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by and in accordance with Section 6.2(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to, but not after, the time the vote is taken with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger at the Meeting of the stockholders of C-COR, the Board of Directors of C-COR may make a Change in C-COR Recommendation in a manner adverse to ARRIS or Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiary (including, for such purpose, a withdrawal of such recommendation
by the Board of Directors of C-COR) (a " _Change in C-COR Recommendation_ ")
and/or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (and, in connection
therewith, take such action as shall be necessary to exempt such Superior
Proposal from any Takeover Statute (as defined herein) and the C-COR
Rights Agreement), and C-COR may enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, in each case if (A) C-COR has received a
Superior Proposal that is pending at the time C-COR determines to take such
action, (B) the C-COR Board has determined in good faith, after receiving
advice from its outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such action
is required to discharge the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
C-COR to C-CORs stockholders under Pennsylvania Law and (C) at least
three business days have passed following ARRIS receipt of an Adverse
Recommendation Notice (as defined below), and ARRIS does not make an offer
within such three business day period that is at least as favorable to
C-CORs stockholders as the Superior Proposal, as concluded by the Board of
Directors of C-COR in its good faith judgment, after receiving advice from
its outside counsel and its financial advisors (it being agreed that the
Board of Directors of C-COR shall convene a meeting to consider any such
offer by ARRIS as promptly as possible following receipt of such offer and
that the Board of Directors of C-COR shall not withhold, withdraw or modify
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of C-COR until the earlier of
the receipt of ARRIS revised offer or three business days after receipt by
ARRIS of the Adverse Recommendation Notice). 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 (i) The term " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ " means a written notice from C-COR advising ARRIS that the Board of Directors of C-COR has received a Superior Proposal that it intends to accept or recommend or advising ARRIS that it intends to make a Change in C-COR Recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the other information required by Section 6.2(a); _provided_ , _however_ , any material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three business day period pursuant to Section 6.2(b) hereof. 

   

 (ii) The term " _Competing Transaction_ " means any transaction, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act) of (A) assets that constitute 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of C-COR and its Subsidiaries or (B) 20% or more (in number or voting power) of any class of equity securities or other capital stock of C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case pursuant to any transaction or series of transactions, including (I) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other business combination (including any so-called merger-of-equals and whether or not C-COR is the entity surviving any such transaction) involving C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries, (II) a sale, issuance, exchange, transfer or other disposition of shares of capital stock of C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries, (III) a sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of assets of C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries or (IV) a tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with 

   ##### 

  

    

respect to either C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries, including any single
or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, which is
structured to permit such third party or another third party to acquire
beneficial ownership of assets that constitute 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of C-COR and its Subsidiaries, or
20% or more of the equity interest in either C-COR or any of its
Subsidiaries. 

   

 (iii) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited written proposal or offer (whether a Takeover Proposal or otherwise) by a third party to acquire (whether by way of merger, acquisition or otherwise), directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the shares of C-COR Common Stock then outstanding (or the effect of which would be that the stockholders of C-COR beneficially own less than 50% of the voting power of the combined or ongoing entity), or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of C-COR and (A) otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of C-COR determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors, and taking into account all terms and conditions of the proposal or offer that it deems relevant (including all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects, including any financing condition and time to consummation), to be more favorable to C-CORs stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, and (B) that, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of C-COR, is reasonably likely to be consummated. 

   

 (iv) The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest (including any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest to its stockholders), whether in writing or otherwise, from a third party that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction. 

  

 SECTION 6.3  _Conduct of Business by ARRIS Pending the Merger_. ARRIS covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated by this Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement, unless C-COR shall otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), ARRIS shall conduct its business and shall cause the businesses of its Subsidiaries to be conducted only in, and ARRIS and its Subsidiaries shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of business and in the manner consistent with past practice; and ARRIS shall use reasonable commercial efforts to preserve substantially intact the business organization of ARRIS and its Subsidiaries, to keep available the services of the present officers, employees and consultants of ARRIS and its Subsidiaries and to preserve the present relationships of ARRIS and its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers and other persons with which ARRIS or any of its Subsidiaries has significant business relations or take any actions which would reasonably be expected to interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise breach this Agreement. By way of amplification and not limitation, except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither ARRIS nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, during the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Merger, directly or indirectly do, or propose to do, any of the following without the prior written consent of C-COR (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld): 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) amend or otherwise change the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or Subsidiary Documents of ARRIS or any of its Subsidiaries; 

  

 (b) (i) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of any of its capital stock, except that a wholly owned Subsidiary of ARRIS may declare and pay a dividend or make advances to ARRIS or (ii) split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock or issue or authorize or propose the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its capital stock; and 

  

 (c) take, or agree in writing or otherwise to take, any of the actions described in Sections 6.3(a) and (b) above, or any action which would make any of the representations or warranties of ARRIS contained in this Agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent ARRIS from performing or cause ARRIS not to perform its covenants hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 6.4  _Recommendation of the Board of Directors of ARRIS_. The Board of Directors of ARRIS shall recommend the approval of the issuance of ARRIS Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement in the Joint Proxy Statement. Neither the Board of Directors of ARRIS nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to C-COR, the ARRIS Board Recommendation.

From and after the Effective Time, ARRIS shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all employment agreements and change in control agreements (including, without limitation, distribution elections under C-CORs Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) listed on Section 4.12 of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule, except in the event the individuals covered under such agreements enter into new agreements with ARRIS, and, for a period of 18 months following the Effective Time, severance plans or agreements listed on Section 4.12 of the C-COR Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding 

   ##### 

  

    

benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by ARRIS or
the Surviving Corporation under which the Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
C-COR or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to its own Employees under
comparable plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, but which shall not
result in the duplication of benefits thereunder. 

  

 (c) In the event that ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation does not elect to continue C-CORs 401(k) savings plan (the " _C-COR Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan_ ") and elects to transfer account balances to ARRIS (or the Surviving Corporations) 401(k) savings plan, outstanding plan loans shall be transferred in kind so as to permit such loans to continue in accordance with their terms without triggering a taxable distribution event. In the event ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation does not choose to continue C-CORs flexible spending account ("FSA") program, it shall nevertheless allow the current coverage periods under such FSAs to continue through March 31, 2008 to permit participants who remain employees to continue to obtain reimbursements for eligible expenses incurred through March 31, 2008 on the same terms and conditions as existed immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) With respect to the welfare benefits plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by ARRIS or the Surviving Corporation in which an Employee may be eligible to participate on the Effective Time, ARRIS shall (i) waive, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee, (ii) to the extent that ARRIS insurance carrier will not provide coverage to an Employee as a result of a preexisting or at-work condition and in the event that such Employee elects continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601 to 608 of ERISA or other similar state laws ("COBRA"), ARRIS shall pay for such continuation coverage to the extent that the cost of the coverage exceeds the amount that the Employee was paying for the benefit coverage immediately prior to the Employees loss of coverage and such payments shall continue until the COBRA period has ended or, if earlier, until the Employee is entitled to coverage under any employer-sponsored group health plan or any government-sponsored health program, (iii) provide credit to each Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee under C-CORs comparable plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time, and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide in-network coverage for State College-based Employees. 

  

 (e) As of the Closing, ARRIS and its affiliates shall assume and be liable for all obligations of C-COR and all of its Subsidiaries in respect of any accrued but unpaid vacation, holiday or similar liability as of the Closing and to provide COBRA continuation coverage to C-COR employees and qualified beneficiaries.

Transaction. C-COR agrees that payment of the ARRIS Termination Fee, if such
fee is actually paid as provided herein, will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of C-COR upon termination of this Agreement. 

   

 ARRIS acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.5(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, C-COR would not enter into this Agreement.
