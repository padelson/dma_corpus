Prior to the Effective Time, ARRIS shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
cash and certificates representing ARRIS Common Stock sufficient to pay all amounts for conversion
of C-COR Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.2 hereof, it being understood that
any and all interest earned on funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be turned over to
ARRIS. Commencing immediately after the Effective Time and until the appointment of the Exchange
Agent shall be terminated, each holder of a certificate or certificates theretofore representing
C-COR Shares may surrender the same to the Exchange Agent, and, after the appointment of the
Exchange Agent shall be terminated, any such holder may surrender any such certificate to ARRIS.
Each holder shall be entitled upon such surrender to receive in exchange therefor the Cash
Consideration and a certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of the Stock
Consideration into which the C-COR Shares theretofore represented by the certificate or
certificates so surrendered shall have been converted in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.2 hereof, together with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, in accordance with
Section&nbsp;2.7 hereof. All such shares of ARRIS Common Stock issued as Stock Consideration shall be
issued at the Effective Time. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding certificate
that, prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding C-COR Shares shall be for all
corporate purposes of ARRIS, other than the payment of dividends and other distributions, if any,
to evidence the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Unless and until any such certificate
theretofore representing C-COR Shares is so surrendered, no dividend or other distribution, if any,
payable to the holders of record of ARRIS Common Stock as of any date subsequent to the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of such certificate in respect thereof. Except as otherwise
provided in Section&nbsp;2.6 hereof, upon the surrender of any such certificate theretofore representing
C-COR Shares, however, the record holder of the certificate or certificates representing shares of
ARRIS Common Stock issued in exchange therefor shall receive from the Exchange Agent or from ARRIS,
as the case may be, payment of the amount of dividends and other distributions, if any, that as of
any date subsequent to the Effective Time and until such surrender shall have become payable with
respect to such number of shares of ARRIS Common Stock (&#147;<U>Pre-Surrender Dividends</U>&#148;). No
interest shall be payable with respect to the payment of Pre-Surrender Dividends upon the surrender
of certificates theretofore representing C-COR Shares. After the appointment of the Exchange Agent

received payment of Pre-Surrender Dividends shall look only to ARRIS for payment thereof.

material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to C-COR and its Subsidiaries
required to be disclosed by C-COR in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to C-COR&#146;s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of C-COR required by Section&nbsp;302 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;<U>Sarbanes-Oxley</U>&#148;) with respect to such reports. For

the reliability of C-COR&#146;s financial reporting and the preparation of C-COR&#146;s financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (as defined herein). C-COR has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to C-COR&#146;s auditors and

required to be disclosed by ARRIS in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and

executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as

reporting&#148; (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (&#147;<U>internal
controls</U>&#148;). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of ARRIS&#146; financial reporting and the preparation of ARRIS&#146; financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. ARRIS has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to ARRIS&#146; auditors and audit committee
(i)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to ARRIS in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect ARRIS&#146;
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii)&nbsp;any material fraud
known to ARRIS that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. ARRIS has made available to C-COR a summary of any such disclosure regarding material
weaknesses and fraud made by management to ARRIS&#146; auditors and audit committee since December&nbsp;31,
2004. For purposes of this Agreement, a &#147;significant deficiency&#148; in controls means an internal
control deficiency that adversely affects an entity&#146;s ability to initiate, authorize, record,
process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A &#147;significant

remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more
than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For purposes of this Agreement, a
