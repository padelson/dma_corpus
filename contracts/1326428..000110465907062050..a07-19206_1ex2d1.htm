# **ARTICLE 2 
 PURCHASE PRICE**

  

## Section 2.1 **_Purchase Price_.** The purchase price for the Interests
(the "Purchase Price") shall be Two Billion Fifty Million dollars
($2,050,000,000) (the "Unadjusted Purchase Price"), adjusted as provided in
Section 2.3.

  

## Section 2.2 **_Allocation of Purchase Price_.**

  

### (a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Shares of
each Company and to the DEPI Additional Assets and to the DOTEPI Additional
Assets as set forth on Schedule 2.2, Part 1 (each an " _Interest Unadjusted
Purchase Price_ "). The adjustments to the

        

### Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 shall be applied to the
Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company, the DEPI
Additional Assets and the DOTEPI Additional Assets based upon the owner of
the specific Lease, Well or other asset to which the adjustment relates, if
determinable.  Any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section
2.3 that are not specific to any Company or Additional Asset group (for
example, general and administrative expense of the EandP Business
under Section 2.3(h)(ii)) shall be applied pro rata to the Interest
Unadjusted Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company, the DEPI Additional
Assets and the DOTEPI Additional Assets, as previously adjusted, in
proportion to the amount of each. Each Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price,
as so adjusted, shall be referred to herein as the " _Interest Purchase
Price_."

  

### (b) Each Seller shall be entitled to the portion of the Purchase Price
equal to the Interest Purchase Price for the various Interests it is selling.

  

### (c) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Target Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best
information available to Sellers, a schedule (the " _Preliminary Section
2.2(c) Schedule_") setting forth the following items:

  

#### (i) the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in
Schedule 2.2 allocated to the Company Assets held by each Company and to the
Additional Assets;

  

#### (ii) the liabilities associated with the Company Assets held by each
Company and to the Additional Assets as of the Closing (as required for the
allocations under clause (iii)); and

  

#### (iii) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under
clause (i) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (ii)
that are includable in the Purchasers tax basis in the Company Assets held
by each Company and the Additional Assets among the classes of the Company
Assets held by each Company and the Additional Assets as of the Closing,
which allocations shall be made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and shall be consistent with the
allocations under Section 2.2(a) and the Allocated Values established
pursuant to Section 3.4.

  

Sellers shall at Purchasers request make reasonable documentation available
to support the proposed allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but
not later than fifteen (15) days following receipt of Sellers proposed
allocation schedule, Purchaser shall deliver to DEPI a written report
containing any changes that Purchaser proposes to be made in such schedule
(and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail). The Parties shall
undertake to agree on a final schedule no later than six (6) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. In the event the Parties cannot reach agreement
by that date, the Sellers allocation, as adjusted to reflect Purchasers
suggested changes to which Sellers agree, shall be used pending adjustment
under the following paragraph.

  

Within thirty (30) days after the determination of the Purchase Price
under Section 8.4(b), but no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (after extension) of filing the Tax Return for the

        

period beginning on or after the Closing Date, the schedule described above
in this Section 2.2(c) shall be amended by Sellers and delivered to Purchaser
to reflect the Purchase Price following final adjustments. Purchaser shall
cooperate with Sellers in the preparation of the amended schedule in a manner
consistent with the provisions of Section 9.4. If neither the Preliminary
Section 2.2(c) Schedule nor the Sellers amendments to the schedule to
reflect the Purchase Price following the final adjustments are objected to by
Purchaser (by written notice to DEPI specifying the reasons therefor in
reasonable detail) within thirty (30) days after delivery of Sellers
adjustments to the schedule, it shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties
and shall constitute the " _Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule_" (herein so
called). In the event that the Parties cannot reach an agreement within
twenty (20) days after Seller receives notice of any objection by Purchaser,
then, any Party may refer the matters in dispute to Ernst and Young LLP (" _EY_
") or another mutually acceptable independent appraiser (the " _Independent
Appraiser_ ") to assist in determining the matters in dispute with respect to
the allocation of the Purchase Price as finally adjusted among the separate
classes of Company Assets or Additional Assets, as the case may be, solely
for the purposes of the allocation described in this Section 2.2(c). Should
EY fail or refuse to agree to serve as Independent Appraiser within twenty
(20) days after written request from any Party to serve, and the Parties fail
to agree in writing on a replacement Independent Appraiser within ten (10)
days after the end of that twenty (20) day period, or should no replacement
Independent Appraiser agree to serve within forty-five (45) days after the
original written request pursuant to this sentence, the Independent Appraiser
shall be appointed by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association.  The Independent Appraiser shall be instructed to deliver to
Purchaser and Sellers a written determination of the valuation and any
revisions to the Preliminary Section 2.2(c) Schedule within thirty (30) days
after the date of referral thereof to the Independent Appraiser. Purchaser
and Sellers agree to accept the Independent Appraisers determinations as to
the matters in dispute and the appropriate adjustments to the schedule to
reflect those determinations, which as so adjusted shall constitute the Final
Section 2.2(c) Schedule. The Independent Appraiser may determine the
issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with Schedule 2.2,
the provisions of this Agreement and the Allocated Values, as it reasonably
deems appropriate in the circumstances and with reference to the amounts
in issue. The Parties do not intend to impose any particular procedures upon
the Independent Appraiser, it being the desire and direction of the Parties
that any such disagreement shall be resolved as expeditiously and
inexpensively as reasonably practicable. The Independent Appraiser shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
aspects of the allocation schedule submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Each
Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and costs of presenting
its case.  DEPI shall bear one half and Purchaser shall bear one half of the
costs and expenses of the Independent Appraiser.

  

The allocations set forth in the Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule shall be
used by Sellers, Purchaser and the Companies as the basis for reporting asset
values and other items. The allocations set forth in the Final Section
2.2(c) Schedule shall also be used by Sellers and Purchaser in preparing
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement (which Form
8594 shall be completed, executed and delivered by such parties as soon as
practicable after the Closing but in no event later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the date such form is required to be filed). Sellers and Purchaser
agree not to assert, and will cause their Affiliates not to assert, in
connection with any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any
asset values or other

        

items inconsistent with the amounts set forth in the Final Section
2.2(c) Schedule unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

  

## Section 2.3 **_Adjustments to Purchase Price_.** The Interest Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted with respect to the Shares of each Company,
the DEPI Additional Assets and the DOTEPI Additional Assets as follows, but
only with respect to matters (i) in the case of Section 2.3(a), for which
notice is given on or before the Title Claim Date, (ii) in the case of
Section 2.3(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g), identified on or before the 180th
day following Closing (the "Cut-Off Date") and (iii) in the case of Section
2.3(h), received or paid on or before the Cut-Off Date:

  

### (a) Increased or decreased, as appropriate, in accordance with Section
3.5;

## Section 2.5 **_Procedures_.**

  

### (a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, (i) liquid hydrocarbons
shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass
through the pipeline flange connecting into the storage facilities located on
the lands subject to the applicable Lease or Unit or, if there

        

### are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the Lease
Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) meters or similar meters at the point of
entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from those lands,
and (ii) gaseous hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to"
the Properties when they pass through the delivery point sales meters or
similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they
are transported from the lands subject to the applicable Lease or Unit.
Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an
allocation of production when exact meter readings are not available.

  

Surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling on or before, or after, the Effective Date, or the Closing
Date, as applicable. Production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of
production, and severance Taxes, shall be prorated based on the amount of
hydrocarbons actually produced, purchased or sold, as applicable, on or
before, and after, the Effective Date **,** or the Closing Date, as
applicable.

  

### (b) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle (and Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with the handling of) all joint interest audits and other audits of
Property Costs with respect to the Assets covering periods for which Sellers
are in whole or in part responsible under Section 2.4, provided that
Purchaser shall not agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for
which Sellers are liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which
Sellers would be entitled, without the prior written consent of DEPI, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall provide DEPI with a
copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by
Purchaser or any Company and relating to periods for which Sellers are
partially responsible.

 TITLE MATTERS**

  

## Section 3.1 **_Company s Title_.** DEPI represents and warrants to

all oil, gas and other minerals produced, saved and marketed from such
Unit or Well, except decreases in connection with those operations in which
the Seller or Company may elect after the date hereof to be a
nonconsenting co-owner, decreases resulting from reversion of interest to co-
owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners elect, after the
date hereof, not to consent, decreases resulting from the establishment or

productive life of such Unit or Well, except as stated in Exhibits B-2 and
D-2 and except increases resulting from contribution requirements with
respect to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or
applicable Law and increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate
increase in the Sellers or Companys (as applicable) net revenue interest;

this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the net revenue interest
of a Seller or Company in any Unit or Well above that shown on Exhibits B-2

working interests above that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 without a
corresponding increase in the net revenue interest;

  

### (b) All leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating
agreements, production sales contracts, division orders and other contracts,
agreements and instruments applicable to the Assets, including provisions for
penalties, suspensions or forfeitures contained therein, to the extent that

net revenue interests below that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 or increase a
Sellers

        

### or Companys working interests above that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2
without a corresponding increase in the net revenue interest;

  

### (c) Rights of first refusal, preferential rights to purchase and similar
rights with respect to the Assets;

  

### (d) Third-party consent requirements and similar restrictions which are

Persons prior to the Closing Date or the appropriate time period for
asserting the right has expired or which need not be satisfied prior to a
transfer;

  

### (e) Liens for current period Taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or,
if delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions;

  

### (f) Materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees, contractors,

release the Assets, or any of them;

  

### (i) Easements, rights-of-way, covenants, servitudes, permits, surface

do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce a Sellers or Companys net
revenue interest below that shown on Exhibits B-2 and D-2 or increase a
Sellers or Companys working interest beyond that shown on Exhibits B-2 and
D-2 without a corresponding increase in net revenue interest or which do not
prevent or unreasonably and adversely affect operations as currently
conducted on the lands covered by the Assets;

  

### (j) Calls on production under existing Contracts;

  

### (k) Any actual or asserted termination of any Sellers or Companys title
to any mineral servitude or any Property held by production as a consequence
of the failure to conduct operations, cessation of production or insufficient
production over any period;

  

### (l) All rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authorities to
control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner or to assess Tax with
respect to the Assets, the ownership, use or operation thereof, or revenue,
income or capital gains with respect thereto, and all obligations and duties
under all applicable Laws of any such Governmental Authority or under any
franchise, grant, license or permit issued by any Governmental Authority;

        

### (m) Any lien, charge or other encumbrance on or affecting the Assets

value of or materially interfere with the use or ownership of the Assets
subject thereto or affected thereby (as currently used or owned) and which
would be accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business
of owning and operating oil and gas properties, including, without
limitation, the absence of any lease amendment or consent by any royalty
interest or mineral interest holder authorizing the pooling of any leasehold
interest, royalty interest or mineral interest and the failure of Exhibits
B-1, B-2, D-1 and D-2 to reflect any lease or any unleased mineral interest
where the owner thereof was treated as a non-participating co-tenant during
the drilling of any well.

  

## Section 3.4 **_Allocated Values_.** Schedule 3.4 sets forth the agreed
allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets for purposes of
DEPIs title representation in this Article 3, consistent with the
allocations among the Shares for each Company, the DEPI Additional Assets and
the DOTEPI Additional Assets under Section 2.2(a). The "Allocated Value" for
any Well or Unit equals the portion of the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price
for the Company Shares or Additional Asset group to which such Well or Unit
is related that is allocated to such Well or Unit on Schedule 3.4, increased
or decreased by a share of each adjustment to the Interest Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 2.3(c),(d),(e),(f),(g) and (h). The share of
each adjustment allocated to a particular Well or Unit shall be obtained by
taking the portion of that adjustment allocated under Section 2.2(a) to the
Shares or Additional Asset group to which the Well or Unit is related and
further allocating that portion among the various Assets related to such
Shares or Additional Asset group on a pro rata basis in proportion to the
Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to each such Asset.  Sellers
have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

  

## Section 3.5 **_Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.**

  

### (a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 3.1, Purchaser
must deliver a claim notice or notices to DEPI on or before a date which is
the later of (1) ten (10) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date or
(2) fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Title Claim
Date_ ").  Each such notice shall be in writing and shall include:

  

#### (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s);

  

#### (ii) the Units or Wells affected;

   

24  

   

#### (iii) the Allocated Values of the Units or Wells subject to the alleged
Title Defect(s);

  

#### (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as
any title attorney or examiner hired by Sellers) to verify the existence of
the alleged Title Defect(s); and

  

#### (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated
Values of those Units or Wells are reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and
the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based.

  

#### Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of Section 3.1 of
which Sellers have not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

  

### (b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title
Claim Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the
Title Claim Date, deliver to DEPI a notice including:

  

#### (i) a description of the Title Benefit;

  

#### (ii) the Units or Wells affected;

  

#### (iii) the Allocated Values of the Units or Wells subject to such Title
Benefit; and

  

#### (iv) the amount by which the Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated
Value of those Units or Wells is increased by the Title Benefit, and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based.

  

Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser
a similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title
Benefit discovered by Sellers. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived
all Title Benefits of which no Party has given notice on or before the Title
Claim Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice which
it was obligated to give under this Section 3.5(b).

  

### (c) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date any Title Defects of which Sellers have been advised by
Purchaser.  No reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with
respect to a Title Defect for purposes of Closing if DEPI has provided notice
at least six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of Sellers intent
to attempt to cure the Title Defect. If the Title Defect is not cured as
agreed by Sellers and Purchaser or if Sellers and Purchaser cannot agree, and
it is determined by the Title Arbitrator that such Title Defect is not cured
at the end of the sixty (60) day post-Closing period, the adjustment required
under this Article 3 shall be made pursuant to Section 8.4(b). Sellers
election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of
Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure,
the Title Defect.

        

### (d) With respect to each Unit or Well affected by Title Defects reported
under Section 3.5(a), the Unit or Well shall, if an Additional Asset, be
assigned at Closing or, if held by a Company, remain in the Company, subject
in each case to all uncured Title Defects, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") equal to the
reduction in the Allocated Value for such Unit or Well caused by such Title
Defects, as determined pursuant to Section 3.5(g). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5(d), no reduction shall be made
in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect for which
DEPI at its election executes and delivers to Purchaser a written
indemnity agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, under which DEPI agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its successors and assigns from any
and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title Defect.

  

### (e) With respect to each Unit or Well affected by Title Benefits reported
under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported under Section
3.5(b)), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the "
_Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for
such Unit or Well caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to
Section 3.5(h), but in no event will the aggregate adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of Title Benefits exceed the aggregate
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price due to Title Defects.

  

### (f) Section 3.5(d) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to DEPIs
breach of its warranty and representation in Section 3.1.  Except as
provided in Section 3.5(d) and the Conveyances, Purchaser releases, remises
and forever discharges Sellers and their Affiliates and all such parties
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings,
claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest or causes of
action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which Purchaser
might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out of,
any Title Defect or other deficiency in title to any Asset.

  

### (g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be
determined as follows:

  

#### (i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

  

#### (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the
appropriate Sellers or Companys interest in the affected Unit or Well;

  

#### (iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net
revenue interest for any Unit or Well and (B) the net revenue interest or
percentage stated on Exhibit B-2 or D-2 (as appropriate), then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Unit or
Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue
interest or percentage ownership decrease and the denominator

        

#### of which is the net revenue interest or percentage ownership stated on
Exhibit B-2 or D-2, provided that if the Title Defect does not affect the
Unit or Well throughout its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount
determined under this Section 3.5(g)(iii) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

  

#### (iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden
or charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Unit or Well of a
type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Unit or Well so affected, the portion of the respective Sellers or Companys
interest in the Unit or Well affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect
of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over
the life of the affected Unit or Well, the values placed upon the Title
Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation;

  

#### (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) an
individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given prior
to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with respect
thereto exceeds One Million dollars ($1,000,000), (B) the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
given Unit or Well shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Unit or Well
and (C) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Title Defects unless and until the aggregate Title Defect Amounts that are
entitled to an adjustment under Section 3.5(g)(v)(A) and for which Claim
Notices were timely delivered exceed Twenty-Five Million dollars
($25,000,000), and then only to the extent that such aggregate Title Defect
Amounts exceed Twenty-Five Million dollars ($25,000,000);

  

#### (vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the
Title Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) or (iv) above shall
not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title
Defect; and

  

#### (vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

  

### (h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product
of the Allocated Value of the affected Unit or Well multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the
denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit B-2 or
D-2, provided that if the Title Benefit does not affect a Unit or Well
throughout the entire life of the Unit or Well, the Title Benefit Amount
determined under this Section 3.5(h) shall be reduced to take into account
the applicable time period only. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Article 3, an individual claim for a Title Benefit which is reported
under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported under Section
3.5(b)) prior to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Benefit
Amount with respect thereto exceeds One Million dollars ($1,000,000).

        

### (i) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts by five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, then
subject to Section 3.5(c), Sellers good faith estimate shall be used to
determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 8.4(a), and the Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.5(i). During the
10-day period following the Closing Date, Title Defect Amounts and Title
Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to a title attorney with at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles in the state in which
the Units or Wells (or majority of Units and Wells) in question are located
as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and DEPI on behalf of Sellers or
absent such agreement during the 10-day period, by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). Likewise, if
by the end of the sixty (60) day post-Closing cure period under Section
3.5(c), Sellers and Purchaser have been unable to agree upon whether any
Title Defects have been cured, or Sellers have failed to cure any Title
Defects which they provided notice that they would attempt to cure, and
Sellers and Purchaser have been unable to agree on the Title Defect Amounts
for such Title Defects, the cure and/or Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall
be submitted to the Title Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall not have
worked as an employee or outside counsel for either Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any
financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held
in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title Arbitrators
determination shall be made within 45 days after submission of the matters in
dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by
the rules set forth in Section 3.5(g) and 3.5(h) and may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to
make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the
arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and petroleum
engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect cures and Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by any Party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator, and DEPI shall be responsible for the remaining one-
half of the costs and expenses.

  

## Section 3.6 **_Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to
Purchase_.**

  

### (a) Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send (i)
notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set
forth on Schedule 4.11 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable
preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on
Schedule 4.11 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting
waivers of such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised
subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8.  The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or

        

### similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered
prior to Closing, provided that Sellers shall not be required to make
payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of
such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers.  Purchaser
shall cooperate, and after Closing shall cause the Companies to cooperate,
with Sellers in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of
preferential rights.

  

### (b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which
a consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is
prohibited or a fee is payable (unless the same has been paid by Purchaser)
without the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a
requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Lease(s) to which the
Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the
unwaived consent requirement, Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract
can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, the Contract
shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay
all amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
performance of any obligations under such Contract to the extent
that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to perform under
such Contract until such consent is obtained.  In cases in which the Asset
subject to such a requirement is a Lease and the third Person consent to the
transfer of the Lease is not obtained by Closing, Purchaser may elect to
treat the unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title Defect and receive the
appropriate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 by
giving DEPI written notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.5(a), except
that such notice may be given up to six (6) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. If an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.5 is
subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b), Sellers shall be reimbursed
in that final adjustment for the amount of any previous deduction from the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Lease, if not previously transferred to
Purchaser under the first sentence of this Section 3.6(b), shall be
transferred, and the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall no longer apply to
such consent requirement.

  

### (c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior
to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for
such Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing if owned
by DEPI or DOTEPI, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from
Exhibits B and/or D to this Agreement, as applicable, for all purposes.

  

### (d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential
right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the
time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the
remaining provisions of this Section 3.6, such Assets shall be included in
the transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase
Price at Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and
Sellers shall, at their sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall
continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith.

  

### (e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise
same (whether before or after Closing), then:

        

#### (i) If the affected Assets are owned by DEPI or DOTEPI, DEPI or DOTEPI
shall convey them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential right provision. If the affected Assets
were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser agrees to
transfer the affected Assets back to the applicable Seller on the terms and
provisions set out herein to permit such Seller to comply with this
obligation (or, if the applicable Seller so requests, shall transfer the
affected Assets directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in
the applicable preferential purchase right provision);

  

#### (ii) If the affected Assets are owned by a Company, the Company shall
transfer them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential purchase right provision. If Closing has already
occurred, Purchaser shall cause the Company to perform this obligation;

  

#### (iii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), the applicable Seller(s) shall credit
Purchaser with the Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to
Section 3.6(e)(i) or (e)(ii) (or, if the transfer of the Asset occurs after
the Cut-Off Date, Sellers shall promptly refund to Purchaser the lesser of
the Allocated Value in respect of such Asset or the amount the applicable
Seller receives from the transferee of such Asset);

  

#### (iv) Such Seller(s) shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such
holder (which shall, if received by a Company after Closing, be paid to such
Seller(s) by such Company or by Purchaser as agent for and on behalf of such
Company);

  

#### (v) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI or DOTEPI and were
previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchase Price adjustments
calculated in the same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3(h) shall be
calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the date of the
reconveyance and the net amount of such adjustment, if positive, shall be
paid by Purchaser to such Seller and, if negative, by such Seller to
Purchaser; and

  

#### (vi) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI or DOTEPI and were
previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, DEPI or DOTEPI, as
applicable, shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser with respect to
such Assets under Section 12.1, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by or arising out of
or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such Asset from the
Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding, however, any such
Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by the actions of, or
implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser or any Company after
Closing, breach of any contract by Purchaser or any Company after Closing, or
gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Purchaser or any Company after
Closing.

  

## Section 3.7 **_Limitations on Applicability_.** The representation and
warranty in Section 3.1 shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date and shall
have no further force and effect thereafter, provided there shall be no
termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section 3.5 with respect
to any bona fide Title Defect or Title Benefit claim properly reported on or
before the Title Claim Date or under the Conveyances.

        

# **ARTICLE 4

and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances, security interests,
options, charges and restrictions of any kind other than restrictions on
transfer that may be imposed by applicable federal or state securities laws
or in the applicable Companys governing instruments.  Other than this
Agreement, and, in the case of the Survivor LPs, their respective partnership

Shares of the Companies that are not Survivor LPs are, and the Shares of the
Survivor LPs at Closing will be, duly authorized and validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid, non-assessable (except, in the case of Companies

rights. Except for the Shares, there are no outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity interests in any Company, or any contractual
arrangements giving any Person a right to receive any benefits or rights
similar to the rights enjoyed by or accruing to the holders of any Shares of
any Company.  Other than pursuant to this Agreement, there are no
outstanding warrants, options, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities
or other commitments pursuant to which any Seller or a Company is or may
become obligated to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests in such Company.

  

### (g) _Subsidiaries_. No Company directly or indirectly owns any capital
stock or other equity interest in any Person, excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any tax partnerships entered into with respect to the Assets.

  

### (h) _Labor Matters_. Other than for Excluded Employees, U.S. Temporary
Employees or consultants, there are no employment agreements with
any individuals who are (x) employed by DEPI or DOTEPI who are rendering
services primarily with respect to the Assets, (y) employed by Dominion
Resources Services, Inc. and who are rendering services primarily with
respect to the Assets or (z) employed by a Company. All Available Employees
are employed by either DEPI or Dominion Resources Services, Inc. DEPI,
DOTEPI, Dominion Resources Services, Inc. and the Companies have no
collective bargaining agreements or other labor agreement with any labor
union, works council or organization relating to the Assets. As of the

or group of the Available Employees has made a demand for recognition or
certification as a union or other labor organization with respect to any of
the Available Employees, and (B) there are no representation or certification
proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently
pending or threatened in writing to be brought or filed with the National
Labor Relations Board or any labor relations tribunal or authority with
respect to any of such employees. To DEPIs knowledge, there are no
organizing activities involving the Available Employees relating to the
Assets.

  

### (i) _Employee Benefits_.

  

#### (i) Schedule 4.2(i)(i) lists all of the Employee Plans.

  

#### (ii) All Employee Plans subject to ERISA and the Code comply with ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable Laws, except such non-compliance as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### (iii) All Employee Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the
Sellers or Companies or any ERISA Affiliate intended to be qualified under
Section 401 of the Code (a) satisfy in form the requirements of such Section
except to the extent

        

#### amendments are not required by law to be made until a date after
the Closing Date, and (b) have filed for or received favorable
determination letters with respect to such qualified status from the Internal
Revenue Service. The determination letter for each such Employee Plan
remains in effect, and, to DEPIs knowledge, any amendment made, or event
relating to such an Employee Plan has not materially and adversely affected
the qualified status of the Employee Plan. No such Employee Plan has
experienced a termination or partial termination within the meaning of
Section 411(d)(3) of the Code.

  

#### (iv) No Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title
IV Plan_ ") or Section 412 of the Code has incurred an accumulated funding
deficiency, whether or not waived, within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and to DEPIs knowledge, no condition exists
which would be expected to result in an accumulated funding deficiency as of
the last day of the current plan year of any Title IV Plan or other Employee
Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code. No proceeding has been
instituted under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate any Title IV Plan and the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan, and no
other event or condition has occurred which might constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of
a trustee to administer, any such Title IV Plan.  The assets of each Title
IV Plan equal or exceed the actuarial present value of the benefit
liabilities, within the meaning of Section 4041 of ERISA, under the Plan,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions and the asset valuation
principles established by the PBGC.

  

#### (v) None of Sellers, the Companies, any other Affiliate of Sellers or
any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred nor do circumstances exist that
may cause any of them to incur any liability for withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan that could result in Purchaser or their Affiliates
incurring any liability.

  

#### (vi) With respect to any employee benefit plan, within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, which is not an Employee Plan but which is sponsored,
maintained, or contributed to, or has been sponsored, maintained, or
contributed to within six years prior to the Closing Date, by any ERISA
Affiliate of the Companies or the Sellers, (A) no withdrawal liability,
within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA, has been incurred that could
result in Purchaser or their Affiliates incurring any liability, (B) no
liability to the PBGC has been incurred by any such ERISA Affiliate
that could result in Purchaser or their Affiliates incurring any liability,
(C) no accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, within the
meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has been
incurred that could result in Purchaser or their Affiliates incurring any
liability, and (D) all contributions (including installments) to such plan
required by Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code have been
timely made.

## Section 4.6 **_Environmental Laws_.** Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.6,
to DEPIs knowledge, each Companys, and DEPIs and DOTEPIs, ownership, use
and operation of its respective Assets is in compliance with all

Asset set forth in Exhibit B-2 or Exhibit D-2.

"Debt Transaction") for the consummation of the

        

## transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser agrees,
in connection with such funding:

  

### (a) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions
to closing (or seek a waiver of any unsatisfied condition to Closing) of each
of the Equity Transaction and the Debt Transaction;

  

### (b) not to terminate voluntarily, or amend in such a manner as would be
reasonably likely to materially impair or delay Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, either the agreements
establishing the Equity Transaction (the " _Equity Instruments_ ") or the
agreements establishing the Debt Transaction (the " _Debt Instruments_ "), or
any partys obligation to advance funds thereunder, provided that
Purchaser may voluntarily terminate either the Equity Instruments (and
Equity Transaction) or Debt Instruments (and Debt Transaction) if they are
before or concurrently with such termination replaced with alternate Equity
Instruments (and Equity Transaction) or Debt Instruments (and Debt
Transaction) from a funding party with comparable or greater credit
capability, provide for equal or greater funding, have equal or lesser
conditions to Closing and do not materially impair Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement when compared to the terminated
instruments and transaction; and

  

### (c) to provide notice of any termination or material amendment of Equity
Instruments or the Debt Instruments, or any known default by any party under
any of them.

  

### In addition, Purchaser represents and warrants that Purchaser
is authorized under the terms of the Equity Instruments and the Debt
Instruments to enter into the amendments contemplated by Section 6.20(d) and
Section 9.9(a) without further consent from the funding parties or their
agents or representatives.

  

## Section 6.20 **_Subco Formation and Assignment_.**

  

### (a) Prior to the Closing (which may be on the day of Closing), (i) DEPI

instruments based upon the form of the Conveyance all the Additional Assets,
except those located in the State of Texas, held by DEPI and (ii) DOTEPI
shall form a single member subsidiary Delaware limited liability company ("
_DOTEPI Subco_ " and, together with DEPI Subco, the " _Subcos_ ") and assign
and transfer to DOTEPI Subco utilizing one or more instruments based upon the
form of the Conveyance all the Additional Assets, except those located in the
State of Texas, held by DOTEPI.  In connection with the assignment of the
Additional Assets to the Subcos, each Subco shall assume and agree to timely
fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be timely fulfilled,
performed, paid or discharged) all of the Assumed Seller Obligations
associated with or with respect to the Additional Interests assigned and
transferred to such Subco.

  

### (b) At the Closing, in lieu of conveying the Additional Assets, except
those located in the State of Texas, to Purchaser, DEPI and DOTEPI shall
assign and transfer to Purchaser at Closing all the outstanding membership
interests in DEPI Subco and DOTEPI

        

### Subco, respectively (the " _Subco Interests_ "). The Subco Interests shall
become Shares for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

### (c) The form of documents to effect the formation of the Subcos shall be
provided by Sellers and shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

  

### (d) At or prior to the Closing, the Parties shall enter into any
amendment of this Agreement necessary to reflect the provisions of this
Section 6.20, including changes from a sale of Additional Assets to a sale of
Subco Interests.

  

### (e) Purchaser shall promptly reimburse DEPI on behalf of Sellers for, and
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller and its Affiliates from and
against, any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, and
administrative fees incurred or suffered by Sellers and their Affiliates
caused by or arising out of or relating to the analysis, structuring and
preparation of documents for the matters described in this Section, the
formation of the Subcos, the assignment of the Additional Assets to the
Subcos, the assumption of the Assumed Seller Obligations by the Subcos and
the assignment of the Subco Interests to Purchaser, including Taxes
(including any fines, penalty or other liability arising from the assignment
of the Additional Assets to the Subcos and transfer of the Subco Interests or
from failure to withhold and remit any Tax related to such assignments and
transfer) which would not have been incurred by Sellers if the Sellers and
Purchaser had engaged in a sale of the Additional Assets as provided in this
Agreement, in each case (i) whether incurred or suffered before or after the
Closing Date and (ii) regardless of whether the Closing occurs.

  

### (f) Purchaser agrees that any failure to have record title transferred
from DEPI or DOTEPI to the Subcos prior to Closing shall not constitute a
Title Defect or breach of any representation or warranty or obligation under
this Agreement provided that the appropriate conveyances as described in
Section 6.20(a) have been executed and delivered to the Subcos prior to the
Closing. In addition, Purchaser agrees that any failure to have permits,
licenses, or other appurtenances, or any Contracts or Records, in the name of
a Subco instead of DEPI or DOTEPI shall not constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty or obligation under this Agreement. Purchaser
agrees after Closing to make any additional filings required with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section.

  

### (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers
shall not be obligated to effect the transactions described in this Section

effect the transaction described in this Section 6.20 no less than forty-five
(45) days prior to the Closing, (ii) a written confirmation agreeing that all
Purchasers conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2 (other than those

written request pursuant to this sentence, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
appointed by the

Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section. The Accounting Arbitrators determination shall be made within
forty-five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the
proper amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of Section 2.3 and may not increase
the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Sellers nor decrease
the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Purchase Price
adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest
(except as expressly provided for in this Section) or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. DEPI shall bear one-half
and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator. Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of
Purchasers sixty (60) day review period without delivery of any written
report by Purchaser or (ii) the date on which the Parties or the Accounting
Arbitrator finally determine the Interest Purchase Prices, (x) Purchaser
shall pay to DEPI on behalf of each Seller the amount by which the portion of
any Interest Purchase Price(s) to which that Seller is entitled exceeds the
portion of the Closing Payment received by that Seller or (y) DEPI on behalf
of each Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the portion of the
Closing Payment received by that Seller exceeds portion of the any Interest
Purchase Price(s) to which that Seller is entitled, as applicable. Any post-
Closing payment pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the Agreed Rate.

  

### (c) Purchaser shall assist Sellers in preparation of the final statement
of the Interest Purchase Prices under Section 8.4(b) by furnishing invoices,

as may be specified by Sellers in writing. All payments made or to be
made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer or immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to
Sellers, for the credit of Purchaser.

  

# **ARTICLE 9 
 TAX MATTERS**

  

## Section 9.1 **_Liability for Taxes_.**

  

### (a) _Taxes with Respect to Additional Assets_. Sellers shall
be responsible for filing any Tax Return (as defined in Section 9.2(a))
with respect to Taxes attributable to the Additional Assets for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and, except with respect to
Sellers income or franchise Tax Returns, Purchaser shall be responsible for
filing any

        

### other Tax Return with respect to the Additional Assets. Subject to
Sections 9.1(e) and 9.1(f), after Closing, DEPI shall be liable for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the Companies from and
against, all Taxes and Tax Related Costs with respect to the Additional
Assets attributable to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, including income Taxes arising as a result of any Sellers gain on the
sale of the Additional Assets as contemplated by this Agreement. From and
after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller and its Affiliates from and against, all such Taxes and
Tax Related Costs attributable to any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date and shall reimburse Sellers or their Affiliates for any such
money paid by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to such Taxes no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days after the Purchasers receipt of notice and
supporting work papers from DEPI of Purchasers liability therefor. If a
taxable period includes the Closing Date, any Taxes and Tax Related Costs
with respect to the Additional Assets allocable to the Pre-Closing Period (as
defined in Section 9.1(b) and determined as described in Section 9.1(d))
shall be the liability of DEPI and any other Taxes and Tax Related Costs with
respect to the Additional Assets shall be the liability of Purchaser.

  

### (b) _Pre-Closing Taxes of Companies_. Subject to Sections 9.1(e) and
9.1(f), from and after Closing, DEPI shall be liable for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser and the Companies from and against, any Taxes and
Tax Related Costs imposed on or incurred by any Company and attributable to
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and the portion,
determined as described in Section 9.1(d), of any such Taxes and Tax Related
Costs for any taxable period beginning on or prior to the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date which is allocable to the portion of such
period occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_
").

  

### (c) _Post-Closing Taxes of Companies_. From and after Closing, Purchaser
shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and
its Affiliates from and against, any Taxes and Tax Related Costs imposed on
or incurred by a Company and attributable to any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date, and the portion, determined as described in Section
9.1(d), of any such Taxes and Tax Related Costs for any taxable period
beginning on or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
which is allocable to the portion of such period occurring after the Closing
Date (the " _Post-Closing Period_ ").

  

### (d) _Straddle Period Taxes_. Whenever it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to determine the portion of any Taxes or earnings and profits
of or with respect to any Company for a taxable period beginning on or prior
to and ending after the Closing Date which is allocable to the Pre-Closing
Period or the Post-Closing Period, the determination shall be made as if each
of the Companies was not a member of its respective Sellers consolidated,
affiliated, combined or unitary group for Tax purposes and, any Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period that are based on or related to income,
gains or receipts will be computed (by an interim closing of the books) as if
such taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date and any other
Pre-Closing Period Taxes (except production Taxes and other Taxes measured by
units of production, and severance Taxes) will be prorated based upon the
number of days in the applicable period falling on or before, or after, the
Closing Date. To the extent necessary, a Seller shall estimate Taxes based on
the Sellers liability for Taxes with respect to the same or similar Tax Item
(as defined in Section 9.2(a)) in the immediately preceding year.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) any franchise Tax paid
or payable with

        

### respect to each Company shall be allocated to the taxable period during
which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such
Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another
taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax and (ii) any
ad valorem or property Taxes paid or payable with respect to the Assets shall
be allocated to the taxable period applicable to the ownership of the Assets
regardless of when such Taxes are assessed. Sellers shall, within sixty (60)
days after the determination of the Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b),
prepare for Purchasers review a pro forma Tax Return for any taxable period
beginning on or before, but ending after, the Closing Date, that shall
include, pursuant to the method described in this Section 9.1(d), the income
Tax liability associated with the Companies for the period beginning on the
first day of such taxable period and ending on the Closing Date. Such pro
forma Tax Return shall, subject to and in accordance with Section 9.2, be
used by Purchaser to prepare a Tax Return for such taxable period. Tax
Related Costs will be allocated consistently with the Taxes to which the Tax
Related Costs relate.

  

### (e) _Period After Effective Date_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event Closing occurs after the Effective
Date, from and after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and its Affiliates from and against,
any Taxes (including Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, but
excluding production Taxes and other Taxes measured by units of production,
and severance Taxes) and Tax Related Costs that are allocable to the period
from but excluding the Effective Date to and including the Closing Date, and
shall reimburse any such Seller or Affiliate for any such amount paid by it
(or paid prior to Closing by any Company) no later than fifteen (15) calendar
days after the Purchasers receipt of notice and supporting work papers from
DEPI of Purchasers liability therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser shall not be obligated under this Section 9.1(e) for any Taxes
attributable to a Sellers gain on the sale of Interests as contemplated by
this Agreement. The amount of Taxes and Tax Related Costs allocable to the
time period described in the previous sentence will be determined in a manner
similar to and consistent with the determination of Pre-Closing Period Taxes
and Tax Related Costs under Section 9.1(d).

  

### (f) _Production Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, production Taxes and other Taxes measured by units of production,
and severance Taxes, shall not be subject to Section 9.1 and responsibility
therefor and payment thereof shall be exclusively addressed by Sections
1.3(xv), 2.3, 2.4 and 8.4.

  

### (g) _Indemnity Regarding Basis Step-Ups_. Sellers agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including following
Closing, the Companies) from and against any and all Taxes,
claims, liabilities, losses, costs, fees, and expenses (i) arising from any
breach of the representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.5(g) or (ii)
resulting from the failure of the Purchaser Holdco immediately following the
merger of the Purchaser Subs into Purchaser Holdco to have a Tax basis that
Purchaser Holdco would have obtained if Sellers had elected to effect the
transaction pursuant to Section 6.15(e) unless such lower Tax basis arises
from any act or omission of Purchaser, Purchaser Holdco, or its Affiliates,
including the failure of Purchaser to cause the Purchaser Subs to timely
merge with and into Purchaser Holdco as contemplated by Section 6.15(d).

        

## Section 9.2 **_Preparation and Filing of Company Tax Returns_.**

  

### (a) With respect to each Tax return, declaration, report, claim for
refund or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including any
schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof (a " _Tax
Return_ ") that is required to be filed for, by or with respect to a Company
with respect to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared in accordance with all
applicable Laws, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit or other items (collectively " _Tax
Items_ ") required to be included therein and shall cause the Company to
timely file (assuming it has authority to do so) such Tax Return with the
appropriate Governmental Authority and shall (subject to any right of
indemnification under Section 9.1) timely pay the amount of Taxes shown to be
due on such Tax Return.

  

### (b) With respect to each Tax Return that is required to be filed for, by
or with respect to a Company with respect to a taxable period beginning on or
before and ending after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause such Tax
Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax
Items required to be included therein, and shall cause each Company to file
timely such Tax Return with the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall
(subject to any right of indemnification under Section 9.1) pay timely the
amount of Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return.

  

### (c) Except with respect to a federal income Tax Return, any Tax Return to
be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9 shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with practices followed in prior years with respect to
similar Tax Returns, except for changes required by changes in Law, subject
to the return preparers ethical and legal obligations under applicable Laws.

  

### (d) If either (i) DEPI or Purchaser may be liable for any material
portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed or
caused to be filed by the other after Closing (or, in the case of Purchaser,
by any Seller) (or any Tax Item reported on such Tax Return is likely to
materially affect the Tax liability of such Party) or (ii) in any case with
respect to any taxable period beginning on or before but ending after the
Closing Date, the Party responsible under this Agreement for filing such
return or causing such return to be filed (the " _Tax Return Preparer_ ")
shall prepare and deliver to the other Party (the " _Tax Payor_ ") a copy of
such return and any schedules, work papers and other documentation then
available that are relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return
for which the Tax Payor is or may be liable under this Agreement not later
than forty-five (45) days before the date on which the Tax Return is due to
be filed (taking into account any valid extensions) (the " _Due Date_ "). The
Tax Return Preparer shall not file such return or cause such return to be
filed until the earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Tax
Payor indicating the Tax Payors consent thereto, or the Due Date.  The Tax
Payor shall have the option of providing to the Tax Return Preparer, at any
time at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Due Date, written instructions
as to how the Tax Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be
liable (or any item that is likely to affect the Tax liability of such party)
reflected on such Tax Return.  The Tax Return Preparer shall, in preparing
such return, but subject to Section 9.2(c), cause the items for which the Tax
Payor is liable under this Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the
Tax Payors instructions if a partner of a nationally recognized law firm
retained by the Tax Payor will opine that complying

        

### with the Tax Payors instructions would more likely than not comply with
applicable provisions of the Code or state, local or foreign Law and, in the
absence of having received such instructions, in accordance with Section
9.2(c).

  

## Section 9.3 **_Allocation Arrangements_.** Effective as of the Closing, any
tax indemnity, sharing, allocation or similar agreement or arrangement (a
"Tax Sharing Agreement") that may be in effect prior to the Closing Date
between or among, a Company, on the one hand, and its Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand, shall be
extinguished in full as the Tax Sharing Agreement relates to such Company,
and any liabilities or rights existing under any such agreement or
arrangement by or with respect to a Company shall cease to exist and shall no
longer be enforceable. The Companies shall not have any obligation under any
Tax Sharing Agreement with respect to Taxes attributable to the period after
the Effective Date.

  

## Section 9.4 **_Access to Information_.**

  

### (a) From and after Closing, each Seller shall grant to Purchaser (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books
and records relating to a Company within the possession of the Seller
(including without limitation work papers and correspondence with taxing
authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client communications
with any of Sellers legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford
Purchaser (or its designees) the right (at Purchasers expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Purchaser (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to
conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions
of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties arising under,
this Agreement.

  

### (b) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Sellers (or Sellers
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books
and records relating to the Companies within the possession of Purchaser or
the Companies (including without limitation work papers and correspondence
with taxing authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client
communications with any of Purchasers legal counsel and personnel files),
and shall afford Sellers (or Sellers designees) the right (at Sellers
expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Sellers (or Sellers designees) to prepare Tax
Returns, to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties
arising under, this Agreement.

  

### (c) Each of the Parties hereto will preserve and retain all schedules,
work papers and other documents within the Partys possession relating to any
Tax Returns of or with respect to Taxes of the Companies or to any claims,
audits or other proceedings affecting the Companies until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to the taxable
period to which such documents relate or until the final determination of any
controversy with respect to such taxable period, and until the final
determination of any payments that may be required with respect to such
taxable period under this Agreement.

        

### (d) At either Purchasers or Sellers request, the other Party shall
provide reasonable access to Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may be, and
their respective Affiliates (including the Companies) personnel who have
knowledge of the information described in this Section 9.4.

  

## Section 9.5 **_Contest Provisions_.**

  

### (a) From and after Closing, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand (the " _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify
the chief tax officer (or other appropriate person) of DEPI or Purchaser, as
the case may be (the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing within
fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of written notice
of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims, examinations,
assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which are likely to
affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the Tax Indemnified
Person fails to give such timely notice to the other party, it shall not be
entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax
Audit if such failure to give notice materially adversely affects the other
partys right to participate in the Tax Audit.

  

### (b) If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only DEPI
would be liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement, DEPI shall have
the option, at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit.  If DEPI does not elect to control the defense and settlement of such
Tax Audit, Purchaser may, at Purchasers expense, control the defense
and settlement of such Tax Audit, provided that DEPI shall pay any Tax for
which it is otherwise liable under this Article 9.  If such Tax Audit
relates solely to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the
Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only Purchaser would be liable under
this Agreement, Purchaser shall, at its expense, control the defense and
settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent that such Tax Audit relates to Tax
Items for which Purchaser is liable to indemnify DEPI under Section 9.1.

  

### (c) If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both DEPI and Purchaser
could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, such Tax
Items will be distinguished and each Party will have the option to control
the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such
Tax Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or
before and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be
identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from
a Tax Item for which the other party is liable, DEPI, at its expense, shall
have the option to control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit,
provided that such party defends the items as reported on the relevant Tax
Return and provided further that no such matter shall be settled without the
written consent of both parties, not to be unreasonably withheld.  If DEPI
does not elect to control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit,
Purchaser may, at Purchasers expense, control the defense and settlement of
such Tax Audit, provided that DEPI shall pay any Tax for which it is
otherwise liable under this Article 9.

  

### (d) Any Party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit
shall be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to
any settlement of such Tax Audit (not to be

        

### unreasonably withheld) to the extent that such settlement would have an
adverse effect with respect to a period for which that party is liable for
Taxes, under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

## Section 9.6 **_Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Seller s
Tax Liability_.**

  

### (a) Except with respect to federal income Taxes, Purchaser shall not and
shall not permit its Affiliates, including the Companies, to take any action
on or after the Closing Date which could reasonably be expected to materially
increase any Sellers liability for Taxes (including any liability of DEPI to
indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under this Agreement).

  

### (b) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall not
and shall not permit its Affiliates, including the Companies, to amend any
Tax Return with respect to a taxable period for which DEPI may be liable to
indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under Section 9.1.

  

## Section 9.7 **_Refunds_.**

  

### (a) Purchaser agrees to pay to DEPI any refund received (whether by
payment, credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any interest thereon)
after the Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including the Companies,
net of any Taxes imposed thereon, in respect of any Taxes for which DEPI is
liable or required to indemnify Purchaser under Section 9.1.  Purchaser
shall cooperate with DEPI and DEPIs Affiliates at DEPIs expense in order to
take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund received by
Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Companies shall be paid to DEPI, net of
any Taxes imposed thereon, within thirty (30) days after such refund is
received. Purchaser agrees to notify DEPI within ten (10) days following the
discovery of a right to claim any such refund if such refund is material and
upon receipt of any such refund. Purchaser agrees to claim any such refund
as soon as possible after the discovery of a right to claim a refund and
to furnish to DEPI all information, records and assistance necessary to
verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

  

### (b) Purchaser shall not make, and shall cause the Companies not to file,
any carryback claims with respect to any Tax Item of such Company arising in
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date with respect to a period
prior to the Closing Date.

  

## Section 9.8 **_Conflict_.** In the event of a conflict between
the provisions of this Article 9 and any other provision of this
Agreement, except Section 13.3 hereof, this Article 9 shall control.

  

## Section 9.9 **_Conversion_.**

  

### (a) Each Seller agrees that it will cause any Company treated as a C
corporation for federal income tax purposes to be converted into a Delaware
or Texas limited liability company (the " _Conversions_ "), such Conversions
to be effective not later than the close of business the day before the
Closing. The form of documents to effect the Conversions and the choice of
Delaware or Texas shall be provided by Purchaser and shall be reasonably
acceptable to Sellers. Upon the occurrence of the Conversions, all references
in this Agreement to any Company shall mean the Company after the Conversions
and the Parties shall enter into any

        

### amendment of this Agreement necessary to reflect the resulting changes in
references to the legal status of the Company after the Conversions.

  

### (b) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller and
its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
costs and expenses, including Taxes in excess of those that would have been
incurred if the Sellers and Purchaser had engaged in a sale of the Shares and
an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code was effected (determined as
if each state respected the hypothetical 338(h)(10) election) and
administrative fees, incurred or suffered by Seller caused by or arising out
of or resulting from the Conversions, whether incurred or suffered before or
after the Closing Date.

  

## Section 9.10 **_Section 754 Election_** **.** Each Seller shall obtain
any consents required to facilitate the elections under Section 754 of the
Code described in Section 4.5(g).

  

# **ARTICLE 10 
 U.S. EMPLOYMENT MATTERS**

  

## Section 10.1 **_Employees_.** "Available Employees" shall mean all those
individuals other than Excluded Employees (i) who, as of the Closing Date are
(x) employed by DEPI, DOTEPI or the Companies who are rendering services
primarily with respect to the Assets or (y) employed by Dominion Resources
Services, Inc. but who are rendering services primarily with respect to the
Assets or (z) individuals who, as of the Closing Date, are employed pursuant
to the college recruiting program of the Companies or their Affiliates
primarily with respect to the Assets, and (ii) who are not U.S. Temporary
Employees.  Seller shall provide Purchaser and its Affiliates not later than
thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement a list of the
Available Employees to whom Purchaser and its Affiliates must offer
employment or continued employment in accordance with Section 10.2, and the
employees on the list shall be the same as those on the list entitled "Census
Data MidCont for Bidders as of 6-8-07" and provided to the Purchaser on June
21, 2007, with changes due only to hirings, terminations and resignations in
the ordinary course, consistent with customary employment practices of DEPI
or Dominion Resources Services, Inc., as applicable.  In no event shall the
number of employees on the list exceed two hundred and two (202) unless
Purchaser approves a higher number in writing. Each Available Employee who
accepts an offer of employment or continued employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date shall be a "Company Onshore Employee." From
the date hereof through a date eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly,
solicit or offer employment to any other employee of any of Sellers or their
Affiliates without the prior written consent of DEPI. A general solicitation
of employment through any advertising medium in the ordinary course of
business by Purchaser or its Affiliates is permitted, but employees of Seller
or its Affiliates may not be employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates without
consent of DEPI. Individuals who are otherwise Available Employees but who
on the Closing Date are not actively at work due to a leave of absence
covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, or due to any other
authorized leave of absence, shall nevertheless be treated as Company Onshore
Employees provided that they accept an offer of employment or continued
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that an individual shall not be considered a Company
Onshore Employee if such individual as of the Closing Date is receiving
benefits under the Dominion Resources, Inc.

        

## Long-Term Disability Plan or has otherwise been on a leave of absence for
more than 180 days and has no legally mandated right to return to Company
employment.

  

## Section 10.2 **_Continued Employment_.**

  

### (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to employ or continue the
employment of Company Onshore Employees for a period of at least twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date (i) at levels of total compensation (base
pay and payroll practices within the meaning of Department of Labor
Regulation Section 2510.3-1(b)) and benefits, including the amounts provided
under Section 10.11, that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the levels of
total compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and benefits provided by
the Companies or their Affiliates to Available Employees under the plans and
programs on Schedule 4.2(i)(i) in effect as of the Closing Date and (ii) at a
work location no more than fifty (50) miles from the individuals work
location as of the Closing Date. In determining comparability for the
twelve (12) month period following the Closing, in no event will the base pay
and annual incentive bonus opportunity for each such employee be less than
his or her base pay and annual incentive bonus opportunity with Seller as of
the Closing Date. In determining comparability, any long term incentive
opportunity, retention plans or retention programs, Six Sigma and Spot Cash
Programs listed on Part II of Schedule 4.2(i)(i), Equity Based Programs
listed on Part III of Schedule 4.2(i)(i) and amounts paid or payable as
retention pursuant to the Transition Plan listed on Part IV of Schedule
4.2(i)(i) or from the Success Pool listed on Part V of Schedule 4.2(i)(i)
shall be excluded.

  

### (b) Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ or continue the
employment of any Excluded Employee effective as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any offer to an Excluded Employee must include
terms and conditions that are equal to or greater than those specified on
Schedule 10.2(c)(ii) for Managing Directors, Schedule 10.2(c)(iii) for Key
Employees or Schedule 10.2(d) for Executives, as appropriate for such
Excluded Employees position. Any such Excluded Employee who accepts such
offer and becomes an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be a
Company Onshore Employee, and Purchaser or its Affiliates will assume
responsibility for, and provide no less than the protections specified on,
Schedule 10.2(c)(ii) for any such Managing Director, Schedule 10.2(c)(iii)
for any such Key Employee and Schedule 10.2(d) for any such Executive.

  

### (c) If the employment of any Company Onshore Employee is terminated,
other than for cause or any Company Onshore Employee resigns by reason of the
relocation, without his or her consent, of his or her work location more than
fifty (50) miles from the individuals work location as of the Closing Date,
in either case within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall provide, or cause to be provided, to such Company
Onshore Employee whichever of the following results in the greater value to
such Company Onshore Employee: (i) salary continuation and health benefits
until the end of the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, or
(ii) severance benefits which are comparable, in the aggregate, to the
severance benefits set out on Schedule 10.2(c)(i) and which, with respect to
salary continuation, health benefits, outplacement services and annual
incentive plan payment are no less than the benefits set out on Schedule
10.2(c)(i).

        

### (d) If an Available Employee (other than a Company Onshore Employee who
becomes an employee of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates on the Closing Date
pursuant to an offer of employment that complies with Section 10.2(a))
receives cash severance or other severance related compensation or benefits
from Sellers or their Affiliates but is subsequently employed by Purchaser or
its Affiliates within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall pay promptly to Sellers an amount equal to the
aggregate of the cash severance and other severance related compensation and
benefits provided by Sellers and their Affiliates to such employee in
connection with the termination of such employees employment with Sellers
and their Affiliates.  If an Executive, Key Employee or Managing Director is
employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates within twenty-four (24) months of the
Closing Date, then Purchaser or its Affiliates shall pay promptly to Sellers
an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash severance and other severance
related compensation and benefits provided to such Executive, Key Employee or
Managing Director by Sellers or their Affiliates, if any, in connection with
the termination of such Executives, Key Employees or Managing Directors
employment with Sellers. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2(c) or
this Section 10.2(d), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no liability
under this Agreement for severance with respect to an Available Employee who
declines an offer of employment from either Purchaser or its Affiliates that
complies with the applicable provisions of Section 10.2(a) or an Executive,
Key Employee or Managing Director who declines an offer of employment from
either Purchaser or its Affiliates that complies with the applicable
provisions of Section 10.2(b) or who is not hired by Purchaser or its
Affiliates within 24 months following the Closing.

  

## Section 10.3 **_Plan Participation_.**  Effective as of the day after the
Closing Date, the Companies shall cease to be participating employers in all
Employee Plans sponsored by Sellers or any of their ERISA Affiliates for
Company Onshore Employees ("Companys U.S. Benefit Plans"), all Company
Onshore Employees shall cease to accrue additional benefits for any periods
after the Closing Date, Company Onshore Employees shall be entitled to such
benefits, if any, from Companys U.S. Benefit Plans provided to similarly
situated employees employed by an entity ceasing to be an ERISA Affiliate of
Sellers (including continued benefits under flexible spending arrangements if
applicable continuation coverage is elected) and Sellers shall, if
applicable, provide all Company Onshore Employees with appropriate notice of
such cessation of participation and accruals in accordance with Section
204(h) of ERISA and Code Section 4980F (and the related regulations), at
least forty-five (45) days in advance of the Closing Date. Except as is set
forth in this Section 10.3, Section 10.2(b), Section 10.2(c), Section
10.2(d), Section 10.4, Section 10.6 and Section 10.9, after the Closing Date,
neither Purchaser and its Affiliates nor the Companies shall have any
liability with respect to any Company U.S. Benefit Plan.

  

## Section 10.4 **_Participation in Purchaser Plans_.** As of the day after
the Closing Date, all Company Onshore Employees shall, if applicable, be
eligible to participate in and, if elected, shall commence participation in
the employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or arrangements (whether
written or unwritten) of Purchaser or its Affiliates covering similarly
situated employees primarily engaged with respect to operations in the United
States (collectively, "Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans"). Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser U.S.
Employee Plan (provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use
reasonable efforts to remove any

        

## restrictions including restrictions in any insurance policy), waive all
limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to such Company Onshore Employees and their spouses and dependents,
if applicable, under the Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans other than, but only
to the extent of, limitations or waiting periods that were in effect with
respect to such employees under the Companys U.S. Benefit Plans that have
not been satisfied as of the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser U.S. Employee Plan
(provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to
remove any restrictions under any Purchaser U.S. Employee Plan or related
insurance policy), provide each such Company Onshore Employee with credit for
any year-to-date co-payments and deductibles paid as of the Closing Date in
satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Purchaser
U.S. Employee Plans.

  

## Section 10.5 **_Service Credit_.**  Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
cause to be provided to each Company Onshore Employee credit for prior
service with Sellers or their Affiliates for all purposes (including vesting,
eligibility, benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all Purchaser U.S.
Employee Plans, including fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick leave
policies, severance plans or policies, and matching contributions under
defined contribution plans, other than for benefit accruals under defined
benefit pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
and retiree medical plans maintained or provided by Purchaser or its wholly-
owned subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such Company Onshore Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Under Purchasers vacation
plan, each Company Onshore Employee initially shall be entitled to vacation
at least equal to the vacation such Company Onshore Employee was entitled to
under Sellers vacation plan.

  

## Section 10.6 **_Vacation and Leave_.**  Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
provide each Company Onshore Employee credit for all of the Company Onshore
Employees earned but unused vacation and sick leave and other time-off as of
the Closing Date as determined under Sellers time-off policies.

  

## Section 10.7 **_Defined Contribution Plan_.**  To the extent allowable by
law, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take any and all necessary action to
cause the trustee of a tax qualified defined contribution plan of Purchaser
or one of its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Company Onshore
Employee, to accept a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such
employees distribution from Sellers tax qualified defined contribution plan
(including plan loans from pre-tax contributions, but excluding securities
and amounts attributable to after-tax contributions); provided, however, that
plan loans may only be rolled over to Purchasers tax qualified defined
contribution plan in accordance with and pursuant to the
procedures established by Purchaser and the third party record keeper for
such plan.

  

## Section 10.8 **_Vesting_.** As of the Closing Date, Sellers shall take all
necessary action to cause the tax qualified defined contribution and defined
benefit pension plans maintained by the Sellers to fully vest the Company
Onshore Employees in their account balances and/or accrued benefits under
such plans.

  

## Section 10.9 **_Welfare Benefit Plans; Workers  Compensation; Other
Benefits_.** With respect to each Company Onshore Employee (including any
beneficiary or the dependent thereof), the Sellers shall retain all
liabilities and obligations arising under any Seller welfare

        

## benefit plans and workers compensation benefits to the extent that such
liability or obligation relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported
or paid) on or prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 10.9,
a claim shall be deemed to be incurred when (i) with respect to medical,
dental, health related benefits, accident and disability (but not including
workers compensation benefits and wage continuation/replacement type
benefits), the medical, dental, health related, accident or disability
services with respect to such claim are performed, (ii) with respect to life
insurance, when the death occurs and (iii) with respect to workers
compensation benefits when the injury or condition giving rise to the claim
occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Section 10.2, with respect
to each Company Onshore Employee receiving workers compensation benefits,
for purposes of this Section 10.9, the Seller or Affiliate employing
such Company Onshore Employee shall be responsible for claims incurred on or
prior to the Closing Date, including payments made after the Closing Date for
such claims. Subject to Section 10.2, with respect to each Company Onshore
Employee receiving wage continuation/replacement benefits for
sickness/disability, for purposes of this Section 10.9, the Seller or
Affiliate employing such Company Onshore Employee shall be responsible for
any payments due on or prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for any payments due after the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller or Affiliate employing such
Company Onshore Employee shall be responsible for providing coverage under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") to any Company
Onshore Employee, his or her spouse or dependent person as to whom a
"qualifying event" as defined in Section 4890B of the Code has occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for providing COBRA coverage to any Company Onshore Employee, his or her
spouse or dependent person as to whom a "qualifying event" occurs after the

for payments and benefits provided by or committed to by Sellers or their
Affiliates to Company Onshore Employees with respect to (i) relocation costs
and reimbursements, (ii) appliance loans, (iii) educational assistance, (iv)

including, without limitation, the payment of all amounts, penalties,
liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are not provided, for a plant
closing or mass layoffs with respect to terminating the employment of Company
Onshore Employees after the Closing Date.

  

## Section 10.11 **_Postretirement Benefits_. ** Sellers shall retain any and
all liabilities, assets and obligations which relate to service of any
Available Employee up to and including the Closing Date and arise under any
Employee Plans that provide for postretirement benefits for periods of

Employee employed by any Seller or its Affiliates that are (i) defined
benefit pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, (ii) defined contribution plans as defined in Section 3(34) of ERISA,
or (iii) which relate to other post-employment benefits for all current

and obligations which relate to any and all employee benefit plans within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that Sellers or

        

## any of their ERISA Affiliates have sponsored, maintained or contributed
to, or to which any of them have an obligation to contribute, on behalf of
any of their employees other than the Company Onshore Employees.  Neither
the Purchaser nor its Affiliates currently sponsor a qualified defined
benefit pension plan, retiree medical plan or retiree life insurance plan,
nor do they intend to implement such plans following the Closing Date.
Therefor, in lieu of such benefits, Purchaser will pay, or will cause its
Affiliates to pay, to each Company Onshore Employee employed by Purchaser or
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date a special one time cash bonus that
equals the sum of A plus B, where: "A" is the product of 12.4% multiplied by
the respective Company Onshore Employees annual base salary as of the
Closing Date, and "B" is the amount necessary to pay the federal, state, and
local income and withholding Taxes on the amount determined in A and B (at
the time payable and based on reasonable assumptions regarding the Company
Onshore Employees tax rates), with the intent that the after-tax amount
received by each Company Onshore Employee from Purchaser or its Affiliates
when paid shall be the amount calculated in A (the "Special Bonus"). One-half
of the Special Bonus will be paid within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date
and the remainder paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the Closing
Date or the termination of such Company Onshore Employee by Purchaser or its
Affiliate without cause. If the Company Onshore Employee is terminated for
cause or the Company Onshore Employee terminates his/her employment prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, then he/she shall forfeit all
rights to any remainder of the Special Bonus.

  

## Section 10.12 **_Annual Incentive Plan_.**  Sellers shall pay, or shall
cause the Companies, as applicable, to pay to each Company Onshore Employee
as part of such individuals final pay from Sellers and their Affiliates a
prorated incentive amount in accordance with the Sellers Annual Incentive
Plan.

  

## Section 10.13 **_Immigration Matters_.**  Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall employ individuals with H-1B immigration status under terms and
conditions such that (i) Purchaser or its Affiliates qualify as a "successor
employer" under applicable United States immigration laws and (ii) "green
card portability" applies to such employees in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall retain all immigration
related liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such individuals
arising from acts or omissions which occur on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

# **ARTICLE 11 
 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT**

  

## Section 11.1 **_Termination_. ** This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to Closing: (i) by the mutual prior written consent of Sellers
and Purchaser; or (ii) by either Sellers or Purchaser, by written notice,
if Closing has not occurred on or before November 1, 2007; provided,
however, that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under Section 11.1(ii) if the Closing has failed to occur because such
Party negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in any material
respect its covenants and agreements hereunder.

  

## Section 11.2 **_Effect of Termination_.** If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further
force or effect (except for the

        

## provisions of Sections 1.2, 4.12, 5.10, 6.3, 6.6, 6.20(e), 9.9(b), 11.1,
11.2, 13.1, 13.2, 13.4, 13.8, 13.9, 13.15, 13.16, 13.17, 13.18 and 13.19 and
of the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall continue in full
force and effect). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1 shall not
relieve any Party from liability (including liability for consequential
damages) for any willful or negligent failure to perform or observe in any
material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein that are
to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing. In the event this
Agreement terminates under Section 11.1(ii) and any Party has willfully or
negligently failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed at or prior to Closing, then the other Party shall be entitled to
all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be entitled to recover
court costs and attorneys fees in addition to any other relief to which such
Party may be entitled.

  

# **ARTICLE 12 
 INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS**

  

## Section 12.1 **_Assumption_.** Without limiting Purchasers rights
to indemnity under this Article 12, on the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall assume and hereby agrees to timely fulfill, perform, pay and discharge
(or cause to be timely fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) all of
the obligations and liabilities of Sellers and their Affiliates, known or
unknown, with respect to the Interests, regardless of whether such
obligations or liabilities arose prior to or after the Closing Date,

proceedings relate (except as provided in clause (b) below), and continuing
obligations under any agreements pursuant to which the Sellers or
their Affiliates (including without limitation the Companies) purchased
Assets prior to the Closing or pursuant to which Sellers or their Affiliates
(including without limitation the Companies) sold assets from the
Midcontinent Area prior to the Closing (all of said obligations and
liabilities, subject to the exclusions of the proviso below, herein being
referred to as the "Assumed Seller Obligations"); provided, however, that
Purchaser does not assume any obligations or liabilities to the extent that
they are (collectively, the "Retained Seller Obligations"):

  

### (a) attributable to or arise out of the Excluded Assets;

  

### (b) directly attributable to interests held or formerly held by DEPI,
DOTEPI or any of the Companies outside of the Midcontinent Area;

        

### (c) required to be borne by Sellers under Section 2.3 or Section 2.4(c);

### (g) obligations owed by any Seller or its Affiliates to a third Person

which such actions, suits or proceedings relate.

  

## Section 12.2 **_Indemnification_.**

  

### (a) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers and their current and former Affiliates (other than the
Companies) and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents ("
_Seller Group_ ") from and against all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller
Group:

  

#### (i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the Assumed Seller
Obligations,

  

#### (ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or
operation of the Assets, whether before or after the Closing Date,

  

#### (iii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Purchasers breach
of any of Purchasers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6, or

  

#### (iv) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.3(d),

  

 **even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person** , but excepting in each case Damages against which
DEPI would be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section 12.2(b) at the
time the claim notice is presented by Purchaser.

  

### (b) From and after Closing, DEPI shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, its current and former Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents (" _Purchaser Group_ ")
against and from all Damages incurred or suffered by Purchaser Group:

  

#### (i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Sellers breach of any
of Sellers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6,

  

#### (ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by DEPI contained in Article 4 of this
Agreement, or in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.2(j); or

        

#### (iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Retained Seller
Obligations.

  

 **even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person.**

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
from and after Closing, Sellers and Purchasers exclusive remedy against
each other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 4, 5 and 6
(excluding Section 6.6, which shall be separately enforceable by Sellers
pursuant to whatever rights and remedies are available to it outside of this
Article 12) and the affirmations of such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in the certificates delivered by each
Party at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(j) or 8.3(d), as applicable, is set
forth in this Section 12.2. Except for the remedies contained in this
Section 12.2 and Section 11.2, and any other remedies available to the
Parties at law or in equity for breaches of provisions of this Agreement
other than Articles 4, 5 and 6 (excluding Section 6.6), Sellers and Purchaser
each release, remise and forever discharge the other and their or its
Affiliates and all such Persons stockholders, officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and representatives from any and all suits, legal
or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs,
liabilities, interest, or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in equity,
known or unknown, which such Parties might now or subsequently may have,
based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Sellers,
Companys ownership, use or operation of the Assets, or the condition,
quality, status or nature of the Assets, including rights to contribution
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980, as amended, breaches of statutory and implied warranties,
nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights
of contribution, any rights under insurance policies issued or underwritten
by the other Party or Parties or any of its or their Affiliates and any
rights under agreements between the Companies and the Sellers or any other
Affiliate of the Companies, **even if caused in whole or in part by the
negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other
legal fault of any released Person** , but excluding, however, any remaining
balance owed by DEPI, DOTEPI or any Company to any other Affiliate at the end
of the Closing Date for provision of goods or services, or employment-related
costs, or other ordinary course of business expenses, with respect to the
ownership or operation of the Assets or the Companies. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentence, Purchaser agrees that from and
after Closing its only remedy with respect to any Sellers breach of its
covenants and agreements in Article 6 shall be the indemnity of DEPI
in Section 12.2(b), as limited by the terms of this Article 12.

  

### (d) " _Damages_ ," for purposes of this Article 12, shall mean the amount
of any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment
incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting
from the indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or
death, property damage, contract claims, torts or otherwise, including
reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other
agents and experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and
the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs
of enforcement of the indemnity; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that "Damages"
shall not include any adjustment for Taxes that may be assessed on payments
under this Article 12 or for Tax benefits received by the Indemnified Person
as a consequence of

        

### any Damages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Sellers shall
not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 12.2 for, and Damages
shall not include, (i) loss of profits, whether actual or consequential,
or other consequential damages suffered by the Party claiming
indemnification, or any punitive damages (other than loss of profits,
consequential damages or punitive damages suffered by third persons for which
responsibility is allocated between the Parties), (ii) any liability, loss,
cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the extent resulting from or
increased by the actions or omissions of any Indemnified Person after the
Closing Date or (iii) except with respect to claims for any Retained Seller
Obligations or breach of Sections 6.8, 6.9, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13 and 6.15, any
liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment that does not
individually exceed One Million dollars ($1,000,000).

  

### (e) Any claim for indemnity under this Section 12.2 by any current or
former Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified
Person other than Sellers and Purchaser shall have any rights against either
Sellers or Purchaser under the terms of this Section 12.2 except as may
be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, pursuant
to this Section 12.2(e). Each of the Sellers and Purchaser may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section on behalf
of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion
and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any
action or inaction under this Section.

  

### (f) This Section 12.2 shall not apply in respect of title matters, which
are exclusively covered by Article 3, Tax matters other than Section 4.5,
which are exclusively covered by Article 2 and Article 9, or claims for
Property Costs, which are covered exclusively by Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 8.4.

  

### (g) Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any
material remediation operations with respect to any claimed Damages relating
to a breach of DEPIs representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.6 or
any Claim relating to the subject matter of such representation or warranty
without first giving Sellers notice of the remediation with reasonable detail
at least forty five (45) days prior thereto (or such shorter period of time
as shall be required by any Governmental Authority). Sellers shall have the
option (in their sole discretion) to conduct (or have conducted on their
behalf) such remediation operations.  If Sellers shall not have notified
Purchaser of their agreement to conduct such remediation operations within
such specified period, then Purchaser may conduct (or have conducted on its
behalf) such operations. Purchaser and Sellers agree that any remediation
activities undertaken with respect to the Assets, whether conducted by
Purchaser or Sellers, for which DEPI may have responsibility shall
be reasonable in extent and cost effective and shall not be designed
or implemented in such a manner as to achieve the least stringent
permanent risk-based closure or remediation standard applicable to the
property in question under Environmental Laws, subject to the approval of any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such remediation activities,
and as necessary to permit the continued use of the affected property in the
same manner and for the same purposes for which it was being used at the
Closing Date. All remediation activities conducted by Sellers under this
Agreement shall be conducted by qualified personnel or contractors in a
professional and workmanlike manner and, to the extent reasonably possible,
so as not to substantially interfere with Purchasers operation of the
Assets.

        

### (h) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under
this Article 12 as an adjustment to the applicable Interest Purchase Price(s)
in the same manner as provided in Section 2.2(a).

  

## Section 12.3 **_Indemnification Actions_.** All claims for indemnification
under Section 12.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  

### (a) For purposes of this Article 12, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having
an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Damages pursuant to this Article 12, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ "
when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this
Article 12 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified
in Section 12.2(e)).

  

### (b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 12.2, an
Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim,
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of
the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect
to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give
notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 12.3 shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 12.2 except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise
prejudices the Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Claim. In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

  

### (c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article 12.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified
Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying
Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it
shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

  

### (d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the
Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person).
The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or

        

### settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to
this Section 12.3(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final
resolution of the Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Claim
(including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of
the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim)
or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other
than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

  

### (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits
its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person
is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to
the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying
Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such
notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with
respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the
defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement.
If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of the
Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its
obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the
Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to
indemnity therefor.

  

### (f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim,
the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation
to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder.

  

## Section 12.4 **_Casualty and Condemnation_.** If, after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is
destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless
be required to close. In the event that the amount of the costs and expenses
associated with repairing and/or restoring all Assets affected by such
casualty or the Allocated Value, determined in the same manner as a Title
Defect in accordance with Section 3.5(g), for all Units and Wells taken in a
condemnation or pursuant to right of eminent domain exceeds Twenty Million
Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($20,500,000), Sellers must elect by written
notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected
by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers sole cost, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date), (ii) to indemnify Purchaser through a document reasonably acceptable
to Sellers and Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser
reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any casualty or
(iii) to treat the costs and expenses associated with repairing or restoring
the Assets affected by such casualty or taking

        

## the Allocated Value for any Unit or Well taken as a breach of
DEPIs representation under Section 3.1, but without regard to the
limitations in Section 3.5(g) (other than Section 3.5(g)(v)(B)). In each
case, Sellers shall retain (or, if applicable, receive an assignment from the
Company owning the affected properties of) all rights to insurance and other
claims against third Persons with respect to the casualty or taking except to
the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

  

## Section 12.5 **_Limitation on Actions_.**

  

### (a) The representations and warranties of DEPI and Purchaser in Articles
4 and 5 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 6,
(excluding Section 6.6) and the corresponding representations and warranties
given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(i)
and 8.3(d), as applicable, shall survive the Closing until May 31, 2008
except that the representations and warranties of DEPI in Sections 4.2(e)
[Title to Shares] and 4.2(f) [The Shares] shall survive the Closing without
time limit, the representations and warranties of the Sellers in Section 4.5
(Taxes and Assessments) shall survive Closing until the applicable statute of
limitations closes the taxable year to which the subject Taxes relate, and
the representations and warranties of DEPI in Sections 4.14 [Operation of
the EandP Business] and 4.18 [Absence of Certain Changes] shall terminate
at Closing.

  

The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit
except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein.  Representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect
after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no
termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to
its expiration date.

  

### (b) The indemnities in Sections 12.2(a)(iii), 12.2(a)(iv), 12.2(b)(i) and
12.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on
or before such termination date. The indemnities in Sections
12.2(a)(i), 12.2(a)(ii), 12.2(b)(iii) (to the extent related to Sections
12.1(a), 12.1(b), 12.1(d) 12.1(e), 12.1(f) or 12.1(g)) and 12.4 shall
continue without time limit. The indemnities in Sections 12.2(b)(iii) (to
the extent related to Sections 12.1(c), shall terminate on the Cut-Off Date,
except in each case at to matters for which a specific written claim for
indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such
termination date.

  

### (c) DEPI shall not have any liability for any indemnification under
Section 12.2 until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all
Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds Twenty
Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($20,500,000), and then only to the
extent such Damages exceed Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars
($20,500,000).  This Section shall not limit (i) indemnification for breach
of those representations and warranties that survive without time limit under
the first sentence of Section 12.5(a), (ii) indemnification for breach of
those covenants contained in Sections 6.8, 6.9, 6.12, and 6.13, and (iii)
indemnification for the Retained Seller Obligations nor shall Damages for
those matters count toward the Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars
($20,500,000).

   

78  

   

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, DEPI shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
Article 12 for aggregate Damages in excess of Two Hundred Five Million
($205,000,000); _provided_ , _however,_  that this Section 12.5(d) shall not
limit DEPIs liability with respect to breaches of (i) those representations
and warranties that survive without time limit under the first sentence of
Section 12.5(a), (ii) those covenants contained in Sections 6.8, 6.9, 6.12
and 6.13 and (iii) the Retained Seller Obligations.

  

### (e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnity under this Article 12 shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified
Person or its Affiliates).

Either Party may change its address for notice by notice to the other in the
manner set forth above. All notices shall be deemed to have been duly given
at the time of receipt by the Party to which such notice is addressed.

  

## Section 13.3 **_Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and
Fees_. ** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 9, Purchaser
shall bear any sales, use, excise, real property transfer, registration,
documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes, recording fees and similar Taxes and
fees incurred and imposed upon, or with respect to, the property transfers to
Purchaser or other transactions contemplated hereby. Should any Seller,
Company or Affiliate of any of them pay prior to Closing, or should Seller or
any continuing Affiliate of Seller pay after Closing, any amount for which
Purchaser is liable under this Section 13.3, Purchaser shall, promptly
following receipt of Sellers invoice, reimburse the amount paid. If such
transfers or transactions are exempt from any such taxes or fees upon
the filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of exemption,
Purchaser shall timely furnish to Sellers such certificate or evidence.

  

## Section 13.4 **_Expenses_.** Except as provided in Section 6.7 and
in Section 13.3, all expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with
or related to the authorization, preparation or execution of this Agreement,
and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters
related to the Closing, including without limitation, all fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants and financial advisers employed by Sellers, shall be
borne solely and entirely by Sellers, and all such expenses incurred by
Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

  

## Section 13.5 **_Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_.**
The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, posted by Sellers or any other Affiliate of the Companies
(except the Companies) with any Governmental Authority or third Person and
relating to the Companies or the Assets are to be transferred to Purchaser.
On or before Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the
name of Purchaser, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, and shall cause, effective as of the Closing, the cancellation or
return to Sellers of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted

        

## by Sellers and such Affiliates. Purchaser may also provide evidence that
such replacements are not necessary as a result of existing bonds, letters of
credit or guarantees that Purchaser has previously posted as long as such
existing bonds, letters of credit or guarantees are adequate to secure the
release of those posted by Sellers. Except for bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees related primarily to the Excluded Assets, Schedule 13.5 identifies
the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by Sellers or any other
Affiliate of the Companies (except the Companies) with respect to the EandP
Business as of the date noted on such schedule.

  

## Section 13.6 **_Records_.**

  

### (a) Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Purchaser any Records that are in the possession of
Sellers or its Affiliates, subject to Section 13.6(b).

  

### (b) Sellers may retain the originals of those Records relating to Tax and
accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, with copies of such
Records that pertain to (i) non-income Tax matters solely related to the
Companies or the Additional Assets; or (ii) non-unitary state income Tax
Returns to the extent such Tax Returns are reasonably necessary to satisfy
Purchasers Tax Return filing obligations under Section 9.2. Sellers may
retain copies of any other Records.

  

### (c) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing,
(and subject to Purchasers additional obligations under Section 9.4) shall:

  

#### (i) retain the Records,

  

#### (ii) provide Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives with access to the Records during normal
business hours for review and copying at Sellers expense and

  

#### (iii) provide Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives with access, during normal business hours, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to

  

##### (A) Sellers obligations under Article 9 (including to prepare Tax
Returns and to conduct negotiations with Tax Authorities), or

  

##### (B) any claim for indemnification made under Section 12.2 of this
Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client
communications with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser
under this Agreement)

  

for review and copying at Sellers expense and to the Companies and their
Affiliates personnel for the purpose of discussing any such matter or claim.

  

## Section 13.7 **_Name Change_. ** On the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall make the filings required in each Companys jurisdiction of
organization to eliminate the name "Dominion" and any variants thereof from
the name of each Company. As promptly as practicable, but in any

        

## case within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall (i) make all other filings (including assumed name filings)
required to reflect the change of name in all applicable records of
Governmental Authorities and (ii) eliminate the use of the name "Dominion"
and variants thereof from the Assets and the EandP Business, and, except with
respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to any Seller or
any of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any direct
or indirect costs or expenses resulting from the change in use of name, and
any resulting notification or approval requirements.

  

## Section 13.8 **_Governing Law and Venue_.** This Agreement and the legal
relations between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to
principles of conflicts of Laws that would direct the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

  

## Section 13.9 **_Dispute Resolution_.** Each Party consents to personal
jurisdiction in any action brought in the United States federal courts
located in the State of Texas (or, if jurisdiction is not available in the
United States federal courts located in the State of Texas, to personal
jurisdiction in any action brought in the state and federal courts located in
the State of New York) with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, and
each of the Parties hereto agrees that any action instituted by it against
the other with respect to any such dispute, controversy or claim (except to
the extent a dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to
or in connection with the allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), the determination of a Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit
Amount pursuant to Section 3.5(i) or the determination of Purchase Price
adjustments pursuant to Section 8.4(b) is referred to an expert pursuant to
those Sections) will be instituted exclusively in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (or,
if jurisdiction is not available in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, then exclusively in the
state or federal courts located in the State of New York). The Parties hereby
waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any
Party against another in any matter whatsoever arising out of or in relation
to or in connection with this Agreement.

  

## Section 13.10 **_Captions_.** The captions in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect
the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

  

## Section 13.11 **_Waivers_.** Any failure by any Party to comply with any
of its obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived
by the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the
Party to whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but
not in any other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

  

## Section 13.12 **_Assignment_.** No Party shall assign or otherwise
transfer all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any
of its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the
other Party and any transfer or delegation made without such consent

        

## shall be void; provided, however, that Purchaser shall be entitled
to assign its rights (but not its obligations) to purchase specific portions
of the Interests under this Agreement to one or more directly or
indirectly wholly-owned Affiliates of Purchaser that satisfy the requirements
of Section 5.11. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

## Section 13.13 **_Entire Agreement_.** The Confidentiality Agreement, this
Agreement and the documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,

Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

modified only by an agreement in writing signed by Sellers and Purchaser and

## Section 13.15 **_No Third-Person Beneficiaries_.** Nothing in this

expressly provided to the Persons described in Section 6.6 and Section
12.2(e).

  

## Section 13.16 **_Guarantees_.** Simultaneously with execution of
this Agreement, Sellers have caused DRI to deliver to Purchaser a guarantee

other agreements executed pursuant to this Agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit "G."

exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of
the transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement is the result of

## Section 13.19 **_Limitation on Damages_.** Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, none of Purchaser, Sellers or any of their

Sellers, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby expressly waives
any right to special or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.
