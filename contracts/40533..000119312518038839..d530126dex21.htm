as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of the Schedule TO,
the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation

to the Company Board Recommendation not having been withdrawn or modified in
accordance with Section 6.4(d) or Section 6.4(e)) and (ii) cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required
by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish the Company with all

after the receipt of such comments (and shall give Parent prompt telephonic

(c)  _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub (x) promptly (and in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
and (y) from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent, with a list of
its stockholders and mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date and of those
persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies
of all lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files
and all other information in the Companys possession regarding the beneficial
owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the holders of Shares (the date of the list used to determine
the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Subject to applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to communicate the Offer to the
holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives (i) shall
hold in confidence such lists, files and information and will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and (ii)
following the termination of this Agreement, shall promptly either deliver to
the Company or destroy, and shall cause their Representatives to deliver to
the Company or destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries of such
information then in their possession or control and notify the Company that
all such material has been so returned or destroyed. Unless the Company has
received after the date hereof and prior to the date of mailing a
Company Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Company Superior Proposal (as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
6.4_), the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to coordinate
the mailing of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 so they can be
included together in a joint mailing to the holders of the Shares.

 

Section 2.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) After the Offer Closing, and at all times thereafter, subject to
compliance with applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the
NYSE, Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant
to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. After the Offer Closing, the Company shall, upon Merger Subs
request, promptly take all actions as are necessary to enable Merger Subs
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board, including
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board (including by
amending the bylaws of the Company if

  



18  necessary to increase the size of the Company Board) or, subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_, promptly securing the resignations of such number of its
incumbent directors, and shall cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected
or designated at such time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the Companys Chief Executive Officer be required to resign from the Company
Board pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_. After the Offer Closing, the
Company shall also, upon Merger Subs request, promptly cause the directors
elected or designated by Merger Sub to the Company Board to serve on and
constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on
the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board
of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii)
each committee (or similar body) of each such board (or similar body), in
each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of the
NYSE. After the Offer Closing, the Company shall also, upon Merger Subs
request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled
company" as defined by NYSE Rule 303A and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
2.3(a)_ are in addition to any rights that Parent or its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, may have as a record holder or beneficial
owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Merger Subs designees to the Company
Board pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ shall be subject to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, including
mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) any information
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Merger Subs designees to
be elected or designated to the Company Board at the time or times
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. Merger Sub shall supply or cause to
be supplied to the Company in writing, and be solely responsible for, any
information with respect to the Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates and proposed designees to the
Company Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after Merger
Subs designees are elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of,
the Company Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, until the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least three
directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each of
whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by NYSE Rule 303A.02 and
eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and
NYSE rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions
thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or
resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a
committee of the Company Board) so that the remaining Continuing Director or
Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person
that satisfies the foregoing independence requirements to fill such vacancy,
and such Person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of
this Agreement. After Merger Subs designees are elected or designated to,
and constitute a majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, in addition to any approvals of the
Company Board or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the
Companys Organizational Documents or applicable Law, the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required (i) for the Company
to terminate or amend this Agreement, (ii) for the Company to exercise or
waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies under this Agreement,
(iii) to amend the Companys Organizational Documents, (iv) to extend the time
for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Parent or
Merger Sub, (v) to authorize any agreement between the Company and any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, on the other hand, or (vi) to grant consent or to take any other
action of the

 



19  Company with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of such actions
specified in clauses (iii) and (v), only if such action would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the Company or the
holders of Shares (other than the Parent or Merger Sub); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of
such Persons deaths, disabilities or resignations, then such actions may be
effected by majority vote of the entire Company Board. The Continuing
Directors shall have, and the Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to
have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company or the Company Board) and other advisors at the expense of the
Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Companys rights hereunder, in each case until the
Closing. Following the Offer Closing and prior to the Effective Time, unless
required by applicable Law or applicable fiduciary duties or for removal for
cause, neither the Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to remove or
request the resignation of any Continuing Director.

 

Section 2.4 _The Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) _Top-Up_. The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an option
(the " _Top-Up Option_") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-
issued Shares (such newly-issued shares, the " _Top-Up Option Shares_") equal
to the lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of
Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Fully Diluted
Company Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all
Shares subject to the Top-Up Option or (ii) the aggregate number of Shares
that the Company is authorized to issue under its articles of incorporation
but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or
otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

 

(b) _Exercise of the Top-Up_. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or
Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the Offer Expiration
Time, in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of
the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (i)
immediately following the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares
owned in the aggregate by Parent and Merger Sub constitutes at least one share
more than 90% of the number of Fully Diluted Company Shares that would be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Top-Up Option Shares and
(ii) the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied. The Parties shall
cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished consistent with applicable Law (other than any Law that requires
stockholder approval for the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares).

 

(c) _Top-Up Closing_. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option
Shares by the Per Share Amount. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or
Merger Sub, at its election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in
cash of the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and payment of the
balance by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (with
full recourse to Parent) having a principal amount equal to such purchase
price (the " _Promissory Note_ ") or (iii) any combination thereof. The
Promissory Note shall bear simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty; _provided_ ,
_however_ , upon any default under the Promissory Note, all principal and
accrued interest thereunder shall immediately become due and payable. The
Promissory Note shall have no other material terms.

 



20 (d) _Top-Up Notice_. In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the
Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Parent or Merger
Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in
which Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price and
(iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up
Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to
Parent or Merger Sub (as the case may be) a Certificate or Certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at Parents or Merger Subs request
or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares,
the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may include any legends required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that
Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"Accredited Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being
and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act.

(f) _No Effect on Dissenter s Rights_. The Top-Up Option, the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares or the payment by Merger Sub to the Company of any
consideration, including the Promissory Note, for the Top-Up Option Shares
shall not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value (as
defined in Section 92A.320 of the NRS) of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to
NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive (if applicable), and none of the
Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceedings
commenced pursuant to NRS 92A.490, in each case only to the extent such
dissenters rights are applicable to the Transactions.

 

(g) _No Assignment_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, the right
to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_
shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or
otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _
2.4(g)_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 2.5 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the NRS, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Nevada as the surviving entity (the
Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger, being sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving_ _Corporation_ "), such that following the Merger,
the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent.

 



21 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer by Merger Sub,
the number of actually outstanding Shares owned by Merger Sub, together with
any outstanding Shares owned by Parent and Parents other affiliates, shall
collectively represent at least 90% of the actually outstanding Shares (the "
_Short-Form Merger Threshold_ ") (including through the exercise of the Top-Up
Option), then Parent shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable without a meeting
of the holders of Shares in accordance with NRS 92A.180.

 

(c) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, in the event that (i) the Offer
Termination shall have occurred or (ii) following Parents or Merger Subs
purchase of the Shares and the expiration of the Offer, Parent holds in the
aggregate a number of Shares less than the Short-Form Merger Threshold, the
Parties hereto agree to take all action required to cause the Merger to
become effective in accordance with the NRS as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions to the Merger set forth in
_ARTICLE VII_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing agreement, the Company agrees that it shall, acting through the
Company Board in accordance with applicable Law, take the actions specified in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ hereto to effect the Merger.

practicable after, and in any event no later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on a date that is two (2) Business Days following the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver in accordance with this

information as is required by Chapter 78 and Chapter 92A of the NRS (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and (b) on or after the Closing
Date duly make all other filings and recordings required by the NRS in order
to effectuate the Merger.

 

(c) The Merger shall become effective at such time the Articles of Merger have
been duly filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Nevada, or at such later date and time as shall be agreed upon in writing by
Parent and the Company and specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the NRS (such date and time being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 2.7 _Effect of the_ _Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the NRS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,

vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of Merger Sub and the Company

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any securities
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

(i) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of no par value of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall
represent one validly issued fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of no par value of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ ") and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, if
any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(ii) _Conversion of Capital Stock of the Company_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _ARTICLE III_ , each Share issued and outstanding

_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(iii)_), including for the avoidance of doubt any

 



23  Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time whose prior
restrictions have lapsed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, shall be converted
automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive from Parent the
Per Share Amount in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without any
interest thereon and subject to any withholding Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_. All such Shares, when so
converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and cease to exist. Each holder of any such share of Company Common Stock that
was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

(iii) _Company, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and held by the Company or any of the Companys
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, and each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub (including Shares acquired pursuant
to the Offer and Shares acquired as a result of the exercise of the Top-Up
Option) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc_. In the event of any change in the number of
Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares (including options to purchase Company Common Stock) issued and
outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior the Effective Time by
reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the Per Share Amount and the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any party
to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other
provision of this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plan or the Director Stock Plan) shall adopt
such resolutions as may be required to effect the following:

 

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options, whether vested
or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be fully vested, canceled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum
cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B)
the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option, which shall be
paid as promptly as practicable following, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after, the Effective Time;

 

(ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company RSUs (other than the Company
2018 RSUs) as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such
Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in
full and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, for each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, the Merger
Consideration, which shall be paid as promptly as practicable following, but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after, the Effective Time;

 



24 (iii) with respect to each Company 2018 RSU, provide that such Company 2018
RSU shall be converted into, and shall constitute, as applicable, restricted
stock units subject to Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Company 2018 RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, with respect to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined
by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company 2018 RSU by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio;

 

(iv) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company PSUs as necessary to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each such Company PSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall vest at the target level of vesting and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such then-vested Company PSU, the
Merger Consideration, which shall be paid as promptly as practicable
following, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after, the
Effective Time;

 

(v) adjust the terms of all outstanding Director RSUs as necessary to provide
that, at the Effective Time, each such Director RSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Director RSU, the Merger Consideration, which shall be paid as
promptly as practicable following, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after, the Effective Time;

(vi) distribute all Accumulated Dividend Equivalents to the applicable
holders of Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Director RSUs, which shall be paid
as promptly as practicable following, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after, the Effective Time; and

(vii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plan or the Director Stock
Plan as the Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to
the Merger.

With respect to any amount payable under this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_
that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause
the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this
Agreement and the terms of the corresponding award that will not result in the
imposition of such Tax or penalty.

 

(b) All payments described in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ (other than with respect
to Director RSUs) shall be paid through the payroll system or payroll
provider of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment cannot be made through such
payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation or
its applicable Affiliate will issue a check for such payment promptly
following the Closing Date. Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds at or promptly following the Effective Time, the
amount of any such payments to the extent that the Surviving Corporations or
its applicable Affiliates cash as of the Effective Time is insufficient to
fund such payments.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained or filed
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate
form) registering (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the

 



25  number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the restricted stock
units of Parent Common Stock as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(iii)_.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as any such restricted stock units of Parent
Common Stock remain outstanding. The Company shall cooperate with, and assist
Parent in the preparation of, such registration statement.

 

Section 3.3 _Payment for Securities_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive
the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the
Articles of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in
exchange for Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent solely in (i) direct short-term
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, (iv) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, (v) in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or (vi) a combination of any of the foregoing, provided that,
in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three
months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Shares pursuant to
this Agreement shall be returned to Parent in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.3(d)_. No such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by
this _ARTICLE III_ or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Common Stock, and to the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
payment under this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, Parent shall promptly provide
additional cash to the Paying Agent to add to the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under this _Section_ __
_ 3.3(a)_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares
for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from
investment of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to
deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(A) an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-_

 



26   _Entry Shares_ "), a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and which
shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, and
such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to promptly receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the number of shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate or
such Book-Entry Share. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
or on any unpaid dividends and other distributions payable in respect of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Shares, it shall
be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Shares, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation (subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_) to pay any dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized by
the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) _Termination Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of and in exchange for Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation to be closed
immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares previously represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares evidencing Shares described in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(iii)_),
without any interest thereon.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent
for payment of their claim for such amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law,

 



27  escheat law or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not
been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at
which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing Shares described in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(iii)_)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, without any interest thereon.

(g) _Dissenter s Rights_. No holder of any Shares will have or be entitled
to assert dissenters rights or any other rights of appraisal, pursuant to the
NRS or otherwise, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
it is determined that such right to dissent is not eliminated by operation of
any applicable Laws, including NRS 92A.390, Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded
payment of fair value (as defined in NRS 92A.320) for such Shares in
accordance with the requirements of the NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by NRS 92A.300
through 92A.500, inclusive. If any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to demand payment of fair
value in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to NRS 92A.300 through
92A.500, inclusive, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)(ii)_. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for
appraisals or payment of fair value in respect of Shares and any withdrawals
of such demands, as well as copies of any instruments or documents served
pursuant to the NRS and received by the Company with respect to such demands,
and the Parent shall have the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares
who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares under the
provisions of the NRS will receive payment thereof from the Surviving
Corporation and as of the Effective Time such Shares will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist.

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from
the amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or holder
of equity or equity-based awards under the Company Stock Plan pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payments under applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be treated

 



28  for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Stock or holder of the equity or equity-based awards in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. As of the date hereof, to
the Knowledge of the Parent, there is no such withholding obligation (other
than any deduction or withholding with respect to any payments constituting
compensation for services). If the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent determine that any amounts are required to be deducted or withheld
(other than any deduction or withholding with respect to any
payments constituting compensation for services), the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, prior to
deducting or withholding such amounts, notify the holder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding is to be made and shall reasonably cooperate
in good faith to establish or obtain any exemption from or reduction in the
amount of any withholding that otherwise would be required.

Securities Act and that, as of the date of this Agreement, has not been so
filed;

Company Subsidiary to compete in any business or with any Person in any
geographical area, (B) requires the Company or any Company Subsidiary to

provisions that are not material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole;

 

(iii) each Contract under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary licenses
or sublicenses Intellectual Property from or to any third party (other than
generally commercially available, off-the-shelf software programs and non-
exclusive licenses to customers in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), in each case, solely to the extent such Contract provides
for fees in excess of $5,000,000 in the fiscal year ending March 30, 2018;

 

(iv) each Company Government Contract that is reasonably likely, based solely
on revenue as of December 29, 2017, to result in revenue to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary in an amount in excess of $35,000,000 in the fiscal year
ending March 30, 2018;

(v) each Contract that constitutes a commitment relating to Indebtedness for
borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property by the Company or

any asset) in excess of $10,000,000, other than Contracts solely between or
among the Company or any Company Subsidiary;

(vi) each Contract under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is the
landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant or occupant with respect to any

42 (vii) each material partnership, joint venture or operating or limited
liability company agreement or other similar equity investment agreements
that involves a sharing of profits with a third party;

(viii) each Contract that (A) would or would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Transactions, or (B) upon the consummation of the Merger, would (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events, including the
passage of time) result in any payment or benefit (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due, or the acceleration or vesting of any right to any
payment or benefits, from Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer, director, consultant or employee of
any of the foregoing; and

(ix) each Contract to or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or bound entered into in connection with the settlement or other
resolution of any Proceeding involving the future performance of material
obligations by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. 

The Contracts of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries of the type referred
to in clauses (i) through (ix) above (whether in effect on the date of this
Agreement or entered into following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date), together with the Filed Company Contracts and the Company
Government Contracts, are collectively referred to herein as a " _Company
Specified Contract_."

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, each of the Company Specified Contracts
is valid, binding and enforceable by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party
thereto, and is in full force and effect (i) except for such failures to be
valid, binding or enforceable or to be in full force and effect as would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) except insofar as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, or by
principles governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is in default under any Company Specified Contract, nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, does any condition exist that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries party thereto, except in each case as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company Specified
Contract is in default thereunder, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, does
any condition exist that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a default by any such other party thereunder, except in each case as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice of
termination or cancellation under any Company Specified Contract or granted
to any third party any rights that would constitute a breach of any Company
Specified Contract, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.16 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
claim, suit, action, investigation or proceeding of any nature, civil,
criminal or regulatory, in law or equity, by or before any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to,

 



43  individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any Judgment outstanding against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, as of the date of this Agreement, no officer or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a defendant in any material Proceeding
in connection with his or her status as such.

Section 4.17 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section_ __
_ 4.9_), environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section_ __ _
4.18_), government contract matters (which are provided for in _Section_ __ _
4.13_) and export control matters (which are provided for in _Section_ __ _
4.14_), each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is, and since
January 1, 2016 has been, in compliance with all, and is not in default under
or in violation of any applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default
or violation that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received any written communication since December 31,
2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement from a Governmental Entity that
alleges that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not in compliance with
or is in default or violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary is pending or
threatened, other than those the outcome of which has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate
their assets and properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they
are being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such
Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all such
Company Permits, except where such suspension, cancellation or noncompliance
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.18 _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) Except for matters that would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect: 

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and since the Distribution
Date have been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, which compliance
has included obtaining and complying with all Environmental Permits required
for the operation of the business;

(ii) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity or other Person alleging the actual or
potential violation of or liability under any Environmental Law or any
Environmental Permit, in each case which remains pending or unresolved;

 



44 (iii) There are no Proceedings or Judgments pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened by a Governmental Entity or other Person against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that allege a violation of or liability
under any Environmental Law or any Environmental Permit;

 

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has treated, stored,
disposed of, arranged for the disposal of, transported, handled, or Released
any Hazardous Material so as to give rise to any liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to Environmental Laws; and

(v) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has provided an indemnity
with respect to, or otherwise assumed by Contract, any liability of any other
Person relating to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Materials.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent and Merger Sub all non-privileged
material environmental reports, audits and assessments and all other material
documents bearing on material environmental, health or safety liabilities, in
each case in the possession or reasonable control of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 

Section 4.19 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) To the Knowledge of the Company, all material issued patents, registered
trademarks and registered copyrights owned by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary are valid, enforceable, and in full force and effect. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all Intellectual
Property used or held for use in the operation of the businesses of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted (collectively,
the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all Liens except
for Permitted Liens, except where the failure to own or have the right to use
such Intellectual Property would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts to protect the
Company Intellectual Property, except where the failure to do so would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, upon the Closing, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries will continue to have the right to use
the Company Intellectual Property on substantially the same terms and
conditions as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately
prior to the Closing.

(b) The use of the Company Intellectual Property by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted does not infringe upon or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except as would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened challenging or seeking to deny or
restrict the rights of the Company and Company Subsidiaries in the Company
Intellectual Property or alleging that the use of the Company Intellectual
Property in the operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as presently conducted infringes upon or misappropriates any
Intellectual Property of any other Person, except as would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing upon or
misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, except for such matters that would not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



45 (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the computers, systems
and IT assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate and perform
in a manner that permits the Company and each Company Subsidiary to conduct
its business as currently conducted, (ii) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with
industry standards, to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of
their computers, systems and IT assets (and the information stored thereon)
against unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or corruption,
and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such unauthorized use, access,
interruption, modification or corruption has occurred and (iii) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all publicly
posted privacy policies of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and all
applicable Laws, in each case relating to privacy, data protection and the
collection of personal information and user information, and no claims have
been asserted or threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary
alleging any violation thereof.

 

Section 4.20 _Insurance_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain,
or are entitled to the benefits of, insurance, underwritten by financially
reputable insurance companies, in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as is customary for the industries in which the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries operate. With respect to each of the legal proceedings
set forth in the Filed Company SEC Documents, no such insurer has informed the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries of any denial of coverage, except for such
denials that would not be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(a) all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and all
premiums due on such policies have been paid and (b) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and provisions of all
insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
breach or default under, or has taken any action that would permit termination
or material modification of, any material insurance policies. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of cancellation
of any of the insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, except for such cancellations as would not
be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All
appropriate insurers under the insurance policies maintained by or on behalf
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have been timely notified of
all material pending litigation and other potentially insurable material
losses that the Company has Knowledge of, and all reasonably appropriate
actions have been taken to timely file all claims in respect of such insurable
matters, except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the limits for any such policy currently in force have been
exhausted or materially reduced.

 

Section 4.21 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Evercore Group L.L.C. and
Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
the Company, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Affiliates.

 



46 Section 4.22 _Opinions of Financial Advisor_ _s_. The Company Board has
received the opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C. and the opinion of Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc., each dated the date the Company Board approved this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered in
connection with the preparation of such opinions, the consideration to be paid
to the holders of Company Common Stock other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective affiliates in the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Agreement
is fair to such holders from a financial point of view. The Company will make
a true and complete copy of each such opinion available to Parent for
informational purposes only promptly following the receipt thereof and
execution of this Agreement and it is agreed and understood that such opinions
may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company has heretofore
delivered to Parent a correct and complete copy of the Companys engagement
letters with Evercore Group L.L.C. and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., which
letters describe all fees payable to Evercore Group L.L.C. and Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc. in connection with the Transactions, all agreements under
which any such fees or any expenses are payable and all indemnification
agreements related to the engagements of Evercore Group L.L.C. and Macquarie
Capital (USA) Inc. (the " _Engagement Letters_ ").

 

Section 4.23 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as disclosed in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is

executive officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (b)
beneficial owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
5% or more of any class of equity of the Company or (c) Affiliate, "associate"
or member of the "immediate family" (as such terms are respectively defined in

to any actual or proposed loan, lease or other Contract with or binding upon
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or owns or has any interest in any of
their respective properties or assets, in each case as would be required to be
disclosed by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 4.24 _Takeover Laws_. Assuming the representations and warranties set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are true and correct, the Company and the
Company Board have taken all action necessary (including granting all
necessary approvals) to render any and all Takeover Laws (including, without
limitation, Sections 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, and Sections 78.411 to
78.444, inclusive, of the NRS) and any limitations on mergers, business
combinations and ownership of shares of the Company Common Stock as may be set
forth in the Companys Organizational Documents to be inapplicable to the
Transactions, including the Top-Up Option.

Section 4.25  _No Rights Plan_. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison
pill" antitakeover plan or similar device or Contract in effect to which the
Company is a party or otherwise bound.

 

Section 4.26 _No Other Representations or Warranties; Reliance Disclaimer_.
Except for the representations and warranties set forth in this _ARTICLE IV_
, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person makes or

Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their

warranties or other information provided to them by Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or any other Person except

actions, a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ that any such Divesture
Actions are conditioned upon and become effective only from and after the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall anything in
this Agreement require, or be construed to require, the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates to take, or agree to take, any Divestiture
Action with respect to assets or businesses of (x) Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or (y) the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,

preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions.

provision or similar provision that has the effect of prohibiting the
counterparty thereto from making a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and shall cause its directors,
officers and its financial advisors engaged in connection with the
Transactions, and will use its reasonably best efforts to cause its other
Representatives, to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third
party or its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect

prior to the earlier of the Offer Closing and receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (which Company Acquisition Proposal was made after the

respect of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_), and the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Representatives may, subject to compliance with this _Section_
__ _ 6.4_, do any or all of the following: (i) furnish any information

party or (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or discussions with the
Person or group making such Company

 



57  Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ _that_ , prior to participating or engaging
in any such negotiations or discussions, the Company provides Parent written
notice of its intent to participate or engage in such negotiations or
discussions.

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, neither the Company

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the earlier of (x) if the subsequent adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders is not required under this Agreement
and applicable Law, the Acceptance Time and (y) receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Change in
Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event and the Company may
subsequently terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ if
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law, (ii) (A) the Company shall have provided Parent four (4)
Business Days written notice prior to making any such Company Change in
Recommendation, which notice shall describe the Company Intervening Event in

such four (4) Business Day period after providing such notice, negotiate in
good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent so that a Company Change in Recommendation would no longer

the foregoing clause (ii), if any, after consultation with financial advisors
and outside counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith

Company Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt,
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ shall also apply to any
material change in the event, occurrence or fact relating to such Company
Intervening Event and require a new notice from the Company pursuant to

including the identity of the Person who made such Company Superior Proposal,
and (y):

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested in writing by
Parent in good faith, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this
Agreement intended by Parent to cause such Company Acquisition Proposal to no
longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the " _Parent Proposed
Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth
(4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel) that the Company Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if such Parent Proposed Changed Terms
were to be given effect, and that the failure to make the Company Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board under applicable Law.

For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of
a Company Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to a Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Company
Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to
Parent a new Company Superior Proposal Notice, except that the references to
four (4) Business Days in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(f)_ shall be deemed to be
three (3) Business Days for such purposes.

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the close of
business on the first (1st) Business Day after receipt) advise Parent in
writing in the event that the Company receives any Company Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the third party making any such Company
Acquisition Proposal) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status
and material terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including, prior
to furnishing any information or to participating in any discussions or
negotiations pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_, advising Parent of any
determination by the Company Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_) and
any discussions and

 



59  negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the
close of business on the first (1st) Business Day after receipt) any written
indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material that
constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreements.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their
respective Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is
required by applicable Law; _provided_ that this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(h)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Change in
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ _ 
(f)_.

 

Section 6.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to Parent and Merger Sub as the Company may reasonably request for
the purpose of including such data and information in the Proxy Statement and
any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain Company
Stockholder Approval, and Parent and Merger Sub shall otherwise assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare in preliminary form and cause to
be filed with the SEC a Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company will advise Parent promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response
and shall consider in good faith all of Parents comments or suggestions prior
to filing the Proxy Statement or exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto
or any response to any comments from the SEC, including any comment
letters from the SEC.

(c) The Company agrees that as of the date of mailing to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy
Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of
the information supplied by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement (which shall be deemed to be all information
set forth in the Proxy Statement, except for information provided by Parent
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement), will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger
Sub agree that none of the information supplied by either of them or any of
their Affiliates for inclusion in (A) the Proxy Statement at the time such
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time such stockholders vote on
approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and (B) any Company Disclosure

 



60  Letter other than the Company Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing
with the SEC of such Company Disclosure Letter or any supplement or amendment
thereto, and, at the time of any distribution or dissemination thereof to the
Companys stockholders, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the Other Party and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

(d) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable
blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

Section 6.6 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required under applicable Law, either after the Acceptance Time or after the
Offer Termination, the Company shall have the right, at any time after the
latest of (i) the Initial Offer Expiration Time and (ii) three (3) Business
Days after the Proxy Clearance Date, to (and Parent and Merger Sub shall
have the right, at any time beginning three (3) Business Days after the Proxy
Clearance Date, to request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of
such written request, the Company shall), as promptly as reasonably
practicable, take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and
the Organizational Documents of the Company to establish a record date for,
and as soon as practicable after the earlier of the Acceptance Time or the
Offer Termination, call, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of Shares as of the record date
established for the Company Stockholders Meeting. If the Offer Closing shall
have occurred, the record date for determining eligibility to vote at the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall be after the date on which Merger Sub shall
have purchased and paid for, and been recognized by the Company as the record
owner of, the Shares duly tendered in, and not validly withdrawn prior to the
expiration of, the Offer. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by _Section_
__ _ 6.4_, if the Company Stockholder Approval is required by the NRS to
consummate the Merger, the Company shall (i) through the Company Board,
recommend, including through a recommendation in the Proxy Statement, that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement,
and (ii) solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement (except for the sentence immediately following this
sentence), the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Shares
represented (either

 



61  in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date
that is more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the
meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist,
and such Company Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); 
_provided_ , _further_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to
the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second
Business Day after the expiration of the periods contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 6.4(d)_. Subject to the earlier occurrence of the Acceptance Time or the
Offer Termination, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Companys obligations to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission of any Company Superior Proposal or
Company Acquisition Proposal, or by any Company Change in Recommendation. If
requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting that have been
prepared by the Company or the Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor or
other Representatives.

(b) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent agrees (i) not to,
and not to permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of any Shares or interest in
Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer and (ii) to cause all Shares acquired
pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares owned by Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the Merger.

(c) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the written consent of
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, duly approving this Agreement and
the Transactions, in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational
Documents of Merger Sub shall have become effective, and Parent shall deliver
to the Company evidence of such action by written consent so approving this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable prior notice,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to afford
to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours and in a manner that shall not unreasonably interfere with
the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
all of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries officers, properties,
Contracts, books and records. The Company shall promptly furnish, or shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to promptly furnish to Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to
the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other relevant
information concerning its and the Company Subsidiaries business, properties
and personnel, in each case, as Parent may reasonably request in connection
with the Merger and this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_, the Company shall not be required to, or to
cause any of the Company Subsidiaries to, grant such access if the Company
reasonably determines that it would (A) constitute a violation of any Contract
with respect to confidentiality or non-disclosure 

 



62  obligations owing to a third party (including any Governmental Entity) to
which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, (B)
constitute a violation of any applicable Law, (C) result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets or other confidential business information or (D) result in
a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No investigation, or information
received, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Parties.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 13, 2017 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all
information furnished thereunder or hereunder.

 

Section 6.8 _Public Statements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will not, and
each of the foregoing will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other
public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the
prior consent of the Other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Party
or its Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public
disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such
Partys or its parent entitys capital stock is traded; _provided_ that such
Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity
to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable
comments regarding same, (b) a Party or its Representatives may issue any
public announcement or make other public disclosure that is consistent with
prior public announcements issued or public disclosures made in compliance
with the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ without the prior
consent of the Other Party and (c) the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ shall not apply with respect to a public announcement in connection with
the receipt and existence of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the
publication of any press release or announcement with respect to a Company
Change in Recommendation made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

Section 6.9 _Takeover Laws_. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will
take any action that would cause this Agreement or the Transactions to be
subject to requirements, limitations, restrictions or prohibitions imposed by
any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) this Agreement and
the Transactions from any Takeover Laws that purport to apply to this
Agreement or the Transactions so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such antitakeover Law on
such transactions.

 

Section 6.10 _Third-Party Approvals_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries will
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities and third
parties necessary to consummate the Transactions and to comply with the terms
and conditions of such permits (including Environmental Permits), consents,
approvals and authorizations and to cause the Transactions to be consummated
as expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company has the right
to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with
the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Entities in connection with the
Transactions. In

 



63  exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and promptly. Each Party hereto agrees that it will consult with
the Other Party with respect to the obtaining of all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions, and each Party
will keep the Other Party apprised of the status of material matters relating
to completion of the Transactions. This _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall not apply
to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Proxy
Statement.

 

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions or (b) any Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or the Knowledge of Parent, as the case may be, threatened against,
relating to, involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, that relate to the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.11_ shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other
provision of this Agreement, (y) limit the remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (z) result in any disclosure by the Company to be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an
acceptance of any exception to any representation or warranty.

 

Section 6.12 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Companys Organizational Documents,
or, if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents, from
and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and also
with respect to any such Person, in such Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other Benefit Plan
or enterprise (regardless of whether such other entity or enterprise is
affiliated with the Company) serving at the request of or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to
the fullest extent the Company would have been authorized or permitted by, and
subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in, applicable Law in
connection with any Proceeding and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, Indemnification Expenses, Judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the Indemnified
Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any
Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in
each case without the requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the payment of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by an
Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall
be made only upon delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so paid in advance
if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_

 



64  extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and
any Proceeding relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Proceeding
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be
a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date
of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such persons heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify
the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a
party from any obligations that it may have under this _Section_ __ _
6.12(a)_, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such partys
position with respect to such claims). As used in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_:
(x) the term " _Indemnification Expenses_ " means reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses and all other
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations
(including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is required to be provided
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, including any Proceeding relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party; and (y) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the NRS that
authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise,
or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the NRS,
and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or
replacements of the NRS adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors, officers,
trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity
in which any Indemnified Party serves; _provided_  that any amendment,
alteration or repeal of the NRS that adversely affects any right of any
Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any Judgment in any actual or
threatened Proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
Judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys
Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents
will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporations Organizational Documents and each Company
Subsidiarys Organizational Documents will contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are
set forth in the Companys Organizational Document and such Company
Subsidiarys Organizational Documents, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective

 



65  Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties,
unless such modification is required by Law, and then only to the minimum
extent required by Law; _provided_ , ___however_ _,_ that any such
modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
modification; _provided_ , _further_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Proceeding made within such period continue until
the disposition of such Proceeding.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will
(subject to the next sentence) maintain in full effect the current directors
and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering
the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution
does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters
occurring on or before the Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor
prior to the date of this Agreement and will purchase the maximum amount of
coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(d)_ would cost in excess of that amount. The Company
may, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the
Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such
Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such in coverage and amount no
greater than the policies currently in place so long as the total premiums
paid would not exceed the maximum aggregate amount of premiums contemplated
to be paid under the previous sentence for such 6-year period; _provided_ that
(i) the Company shall give Parent a consultation right in the selection of
such "tail" policy and the Company shall give good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent with respect thereto, and (ii) if such tail policy is
so purchased, Parent will be relieved of its obligations under the previous
sentence.

 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

(g) This _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ survives the consummation of the Merger and
is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

Section 6.13 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act. Prior to taking the actions required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, the
Company will provide Parent copies of any resolutions or other documentation
with respect to such actions and the Company shall give consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.

 



66 Section 6.14 _New York Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the listing of the Company Common Stock on the NYSE and the
registration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act, in each case,
until the Effective Time, and (b) cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act promptly
after the Effective Time. 

Section 6.15 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year after the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who is an
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, any such employees who are on
disability or other approved leave), other than an employee whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement,
the terms and conditions of which shall be respected by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Continuing Employee_ "), for so long as the
Continuing Employee is employed by the Surviving Corporation during the
Continuation Period, (i) base salary or wages that are no less favorable than
the base salary or wages provided to each such Continuing Employee by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) annual cash bonus or other short-term or long-term cash or equity
incentive compensation opportunities, as applicable, that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the annual cash bonus or other short-term or
long-term cash or equity incentive compensation opportunities provided to each
such Continuing Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits that are no
less favorable than those that would have been provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (iv) employee benefits (except to the extent
otherwise covered by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(b) To the extent that participants in the Companys 2018 annual cash bonus
plans (the " _MIPS_ ") have not been paid their 2018 annual bonus at the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause the Parent Subsidiaries to pay, in
cash on or before June 1, 2018, to each Qualified Continuing Employee (as
defined below) who is a participant in the MIPS the Qualified Continuing
Employees actual bonus for 2018 as calculated based on the Companys
performance through March 30, 2018. A " _Qualified Continuing Employee_ "
means each Continuing Employee who is employed as of the 2018 annual bonus
payment date, and each Continuing Employee whose employment with the Surviving
Corporation is terminated by the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time and prior to such payment date for a reason other than "cause"
or who terminated employment with the Surviving Corporation for "good reason"

Affiliates. To the extent Parent causes a Continuing Employee to cease to be
eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan and instead provides for
such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a Benefit Plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates (the "
_Replacement Plans_ "), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan,
Parent shall credit (or cause to be credited) such Continuing Employee, for

comparable Company Benefit Plan. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their
Affiliates, and the Replacement Plans shall recognize each Continuing
Employees years of service and level of seniority with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer
that was recognized by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes
of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination
(but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or
eligibility for any retiree health or welfare benefit) under the Replacement
Plans. Parent shall cause each Replacement Plan to waive any preexisting
condition exclusion or restriction with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to a Continuing Employee to the extent such exclusion
or restriction did not apply with respect to such employee under
the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor their respective obligations under
all employment, severance, change in control, bonus and other agreements and
plans, and to assume any such agreements and plans that require or contemplate
assumption by their terms by an acquirer or successor, but subject to any
provisions thereof related to termination or amendment of such agreements and
plans.

(e) Parent or its applicable Affiliate will assume and honor all vacation and
other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by each
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any benefit or compensation plan, program, Contract,
arrangement or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary), other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

77 Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the Other Party, except that (a) Merger Sub may assign, in each
entitys sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, (b) Parent may
assign any of its rights (but not delegate any of its obligations) under this
Agreement to one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent but, in each
case, no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations
hereunder and (c) the Company may assign any of its rights (but not delegate
any of its obligations) under  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ to one or more wholly
owned Subsidiaries, but no such assignment shall relieve the Company of any of
its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment not permitted under this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be null and void.

Section 9.5 _Entire Understanding: No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents
and instruments executed pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the matters therein and herein
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings on such matters. The
provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, their respective
successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors except,
(i) following the Effective Time as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ (which
will be to the benefit of the Persons referred to in such Section), (ii)
following the Effective Time the rights of holders of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration and (iii) following the Effective Time the
rights of holders of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and
Director RSUs to receive such amounts as provided for in _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,
(iv)  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.12_, which, to the extent applicable to the Debt Financing
Sources (or any of their respective Affiliates or their or their respective
Affiliates Representatives), are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by,
the Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective Affiliates or their or
their respective Affiliates Representatives).

Section 9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions of
this Agreement in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision
of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.
If a final Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any
term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term
or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 



78 Section 9.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws
of the State of Nevada (without giving effect to choice of law principles
thereof) shall govern (i) the Merger (including the consummation and effects
thereof) to the extent the application of Nevada law is required and (ii) the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board.

(b) The Parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in
the State of Delaware, in connection with any dispute that arises in respect
of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement or in
respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for interpretation or enforcement
hereof or any such document that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said
courts or that venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or
any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and each Party
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such action, suit or
proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively by such a Delaware state
or federal court and that it will not bring any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the documents referred to in
this Agreement or the Transactions in any other court. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with such action, suit or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and each Party
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from such court; _provided_ that each
Partys consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _
9.7(b)_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7(b)_
and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to such courts or a
submission to such courts other than for such purpose.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parties, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, will bring, or support, any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, anywhere other than in (i) any New York State court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or (ii) the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, and it is acknowledged and agreed that
the provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.7(d)_ relating to the waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim, counterclaim or third-party claim.

 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR

 



79  ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

Section 9.8 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney or Representative of any Party hereto has any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by the Parties. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks
jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance and further agrees not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law
or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each Party
further agrees that neither the Other Party nor any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.9_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

Section 9.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger shall be paid
by the Surviving Corporation when due.

 

Section 9.11 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as
of the Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time.
The covenants and agreements of the Parties (including the Surviving
Corporation) shall survive the Effective Time without limitation (except
for those which, by their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period).

Section 9.12 _Debt Financing Sources Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have
any liability to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing or otherwise, whether at Law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and the Company shall not have any rights or claims against any
Debt Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.

Conditions of the Offer

 

The obligation of Merger Sub to and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger
Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in clauses "(a)" through "(i)" below. Accordingly,
notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement to the contrary,
Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Exchange Act Rule
14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered
Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for,
and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to such rules and
regulations, the payment for, any tendered Shares and, if permitted by the
Merger Agreement, may terminate the Offer: (i) if the Merger Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_; or (ii) at any
scheduled Offer Expiration Time (as the Offer may have been extended pursuant
to, and subject to any requirements to extend the Offer pursuant to, _Section_
__ _ 2.1(c)_ of the Merger Agreement), if, with respect to clause (ii) only:
(A) the Minimum Condition or the Termination Condition shall not be satisfied
by the Offer Expiration Time; or (B) any of the additional conditions set
forth below shall not be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waived in writing by Parent:

 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn that number of Shares that when added to the number of Shares owned
by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole as of such scheduled
Offer Expiration Time would represent one (1) Share more than fifty percent
(50%) of the Fully Diluted Company Shares at such date (not assuming
the issuance of any Top-Up Option Shares) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(b) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn that number of Shares that when added to the number of Shares owned
by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole as of such scheduled
Offer Expiration Time would represent, when added to the number of Shares
authorized and available for issuance and sale by the Company to Merger Sub in
connection with an exercise of the Top-Up Option, one (1) Share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Company Shares (assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares);

 

(c) the waiting period applicable to the Transactions under the HSR Act shall
have expired or been terminated, and any approvals, consent or clearance
required in connection with the Transactions shall have been obtained, in each
case, under or in relation to the HSR Act;

(d) no Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any Party shall have
issued any order (whether preliminary, temporary or permanent) or taken any
other action, in each case restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions nor any Law shall be in effect that makes
consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited;

(e) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall not have occurred a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

(f) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in (i) the
Merger Agreement (other than those representations and warranties referenced
in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ of the Merger
Agreement) are true and correct as of the Offer Expiration Time, as if made
as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date), except where the failure of such representations
and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving  effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" set forth in any such representation or warranty) would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) _ Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_, and
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_ (Capital Structure) of the Merger Agreement are true
and correct as of the Offer Expiration Time, as if made as of such time
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date), except for any immaterial inaccuracies, and (iii) _ Section_
__ _ 4.8(a)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) are true and correct in
all respects as of the Offer Expiration Time, as if made as of such time; and
(iv) _ Section_ __ _ 4.4_ (Authority; Execution and Delivery;
Enforceability), _Section_ __ _ 4.24_ (Takeover Laws) and _Section_ __ _
4.25_ (No Rights Plan) shall be true and correct in all material respects, in
each case, as of the Offer Expiration Time, as if made as of such time
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date);

 

(g) each and all of the agreements and covenants of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to be performed and complied with pursuant to
the Agreement on or prior to the Offer Expiration Time have been duly
performed and complied with in all material respects;

(h) Parent shall have received a certificate of the Company signed by an
executive officer of the Company, dated the date on the which the Offer
expires, certifying that the conditions specified in clauses _(e)_ , _(f)_ and
_(g)_ of this _Annex A_ have been satisfied; and

(i) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition and the condition
set forth in clause (b) of this _Annex A_ have been satisfied, Parent and
Merger Sub shall exclude for purposes of determination thereof shares tendered
in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
received.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition (each of
which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the Company), may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject
in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law. Any
reference in this _Annex A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not
be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this _Annex A_ is attached. _Exhibit B _

_ARTICLE VI _

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

 

Notwithstanding Article V above and without derogation of the provisions
thereof, the following provisions shall be in effect through the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time (as defined in that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of February 9, 2018, by and between the Corporation,
General Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Red Hawk
Enterprises Corp., a Nevada corporation (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), and then only to the minimum extent required by Law:

 



2 (a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed
to become a director or officer of the Corporation or is serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
or by reason of actions alleged to have been taken or omitted in such
capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer. The
indemnification of directors and officers by the Corporation shall be to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as such law
exists or may hereafter be amended (but only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than permitted prior to the amendment). The indemnification of directors and
officers shall be against all loss, liability and expense (including
attorneys fees, costs, damages, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement
and ERISA excise taxes or penalties) actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of a director or officer in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding, including any appeal; provided, however, that with respect to any
action, suit or proceeding initiated by a director or officer, the Corporation
shall indemnify such director or officer only if the action, suit or
proceeding was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation, except
with respect to a suit for the enforcement of rights to indemnification or
advancement of expenses in accordance with Section (c) hereof.

 

(b) The expenses of directors and officers incurred as a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative shall be paid by the Corporation as
they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit
or proceeding; provided, however, that if applicable law so requires, the
advance payment of expenses shall be made only upon receipt by the
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it is ultimately determined by
a final decision, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction that
the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses
under this Article VI.

 

(c) Any director or officer may enforce his or her rights to indemnification
or advance payments for expenses in a suit brought against the Corporation if
his or her request for indemnification or advance payments for expenses is
wholly or partially refused by the Corporation or if there is no determination
with respect to such request within 60 days from receipt by the Corporation of
a written notice from the director or officer for such a determination. If a
director or officer is successful in establishing in a suit his or her
entitlement to receive or recover an advancement of expenses or a right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, he or she shall also be indemnified by
the Corporation for costs and expenses incurred in such suit. It shall be a
defense to any such suit (other than a suit brought to enforce a claim for the
advancement of expenses under Section (b) of this Article VI where the
required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the NRS. Neither the
failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the director or officer is
proper in the circumstances because the director or officer has met the
applicable standard of conduct nor a determination by the Corporation that the
director or officer has not met such applicable standard of conduct shall be
a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the director or officer has
not met the applicable standard of conduct. In a suit brought by a 

 



3  director or officer to enforce a right under this Section (c) or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the burden of proving that a director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified or is not entitled to an advancement of expenses under this
Section (c) or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.

 

(d) The right to indemnification and to the payment of expenses as they are
incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or
proceeding shall not be exclusive of any other right to which a person may be
entitled under these articles of incorporation or any bylaw, agreement,
statute, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. The
right to indemnification under Section (a) hereof shall continue for a person
who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of
his or her heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators and legal
representatives.

 

(e) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
loss, liability or expense, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such loss, liability or expense under
the NRS. 

(f) The Corporation shall not be obligated to reimburse the amount of any
settlement unless it has agreed to such settlement If any person shall
unreasonably fail to enter into a settlement of any action, suit or proceeding
within the scope of Section (a) hereof, offered or assented to by the opposing
party or parties and which is acceptable to the Corporation,
then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, the
indemnification obligation of the Corporation in connection with such action,
suit or proceeding shall be limited to the total of the amount at which
settlement could have been made and the expenses incurred by such person
prior to the time the settlement could reasonably have been effected.

(g) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation or to any director,
officer, employee or agent of any of its subsidiaries to the fullest extent
of the provisions of this Article VI subject to the imposition of any
conditions or limitations as the board of directors of the Corporation may
deem necessary or appropriate.

brought before the meeting pursuant to these Amended and Restated Bylaws (as
amended from time to time, these " _Bylaws_ ").

Section 2.2 _Special Meetings_.

 

(a) Subject to any rights of stockholders set forth in the articles of
incorporation of the Corporation (as amended from time to time, the "
_Articles of Incorporation_ "), special meetings of the stockholders may be
called only by the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer, or,
if there be no chairman of the board and no chief executive officer, by
the president, and shall be called by the secretary upon the written request
of at least a majority of the Board of Directors or the holders of not less
than a majority of the voting power of the Corporations stock entitled to
vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

(b) No business shall be acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders
except as set forth in the notice of the meeting.

Section 2.3 _Place of Meetings_. Any meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation may be held at the Corporations registered office in the State
of Nevada or at such other place in or out of the State of Nevada and the
United States as may be designated in the notice of meeting. A waiver of
notice signed by all stockholders entitled to vote thereat may designate any
place for the holding of such meeting. The Board of Directors may, in its sole
discretion, determine that any meeting of the stockholders shall be held by
means of electronic communications or other available technology in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.10_. Section 2.4 _Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice_.

 

(a) The chief executive officer, if any, the president, any vice president,
the secretary, an assistant secretary or any other individual designated by
the Board of Directors shall sign and deliver or cause to be delivered to the
stockholders written notice of any stockholders meeting not less than ten
(10) days, but not more than sixty (60) days, before the date of such
meeting. The notice shall state the place, date and time of the meeting, the
means of electronic communication, if any, by which the stockholders or the
proxies thereof shall be deemed to be present and vote and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The
notice shall be delivered in accordance with, and shall contain or be
accompanied by such additional information as may be required by, the Nevada
Revised Statutes (" _NRS_ "), including, without limitation, NRS 78.379,
92A.120 or 92A.410.

(b) In the case of an annual meeting, any proper business may be presented
for action, except that (i) if a proposed plan of merger, conversion or
exchange is submitted to a vote, the notice of the meeting must state that the
purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of
merger, conversion or exchange and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or
summary of the plan; and (ii) if a proposed action creating dissenters rights
is to be submitted to a vote, the notice of the meeting must state that the
stockholders are or may be entitled to assert dissenters rights under NRS
92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, and be accompanied by a copy of those sections.

 

(c) A copy of the notice shall be personally delivered or mailed postage
prepaid to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting (unless
the NRS requires delivery to all stockholders of record, in which case such
notice shall be delivered to all such stockholders) at the address appearing
on the records of the Corporation. Upon mailing, service of the notice is
complete, and the time of the notice begins to run from the date upon which
the notice is deposited in the mail. If the address of any stockholder does
not appear upon the records of the Corporation or is incomplete, it will be
sufficient to address any notice to such stockholder at the registered office
of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing and in addition thereto, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to Chapters 78 or 92A
of the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, may be given
pursuant to the forms of electronic transmission listed herein, if such forms
of transmission are consented to in writing by the stockholder receiving such
electronically transmitted notice and such consent is filed by the secretary
in the corporate records. Notice shall be deemed given (i) by facsimile when
directed to a number consented to by the stockholder to receive notice, (ii)
by electronic mail when directed to an e-mail address consented to by the
stockholder to receive notice, (iii) by posting on an electronic network
together with a separate notice to the stockholder of the specific posting on
the later of the specific posting or the giving of the separate notice or
(iv) by any other electronic transmission as consented to by and when directed
to the stockholder. The stockholder consent necessary to permit electronic
transmission to such stockholder shall be deemed revoked and of no force and
effect if (A) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission
two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with the
stockholders consent and (B) the inability to deliver by electronic
transmission becomes known to the secretary, assistant secretary, transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation responsible for the giving of notice.

 



2 (d) The written certificate of an individual signing a notice of meeting,
setting forth the substance of the notice or having a copy thereof attached
thereto, the date the notice was mailed or personally delivered to the
stockholders and the addresses to which the notice was mailed, shall be prima
facie evidence of the manner and fact of giving such notice and, in the
absence of fraud, an affidavit of the individual signing a notice of a meeting
that the notice thereof has been given by a form of electronic transmission
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.

(e) Any stockholder may waive notice of any meeting by a signed writing or by
transmission of an electronic record, either before or after the meeting.
Such waiver of notice shall be deemed the equivalent of the giving of such
notice.

Section 2.5  _Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

(a) For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to (i) notice of
and to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, (ii)
receive payment of any distribution or the allotment of any rights, or (iii)
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may
fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days
nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, if applicable.

 

(b) The Board of Directors may adopt a resolution prescribing a date upon
which the stockholders of record entitled to give written consent must be
determined. The date set by the Board of Directors must not precede or be more
than ten (10) days after the date the resolution setting such date is adopted
by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors does not adopt
a resolution setting a date upon which the stockholders of record entitled to
give written consent must be determined and

 

(i) no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the NRS, then the
date shall be the first date on which a valid written consent is delivered to
the Corporation in accordance with the NRS and these Bylaws; or

(ii) prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the NRS, then the
date shall be the close of business on the date that the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution.

 

(c) If no record date is fixed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, the record date for determining stockholders: (i)
entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) for any other purpose shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any postponement of any meeting of stockholders to a date not more than sixty
(60) days after the record date or to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting and must fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned
to a date more than 60 days later than the date set for the original meeting.

 



3 Section 2.6 _Quorum; Adjourned Meetings_.

 

(a) Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different proportion,
stockholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the
Corporations capital stock, represented in person or by proxy (regardless of
whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), are necessary to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting. If, on any
issue, voting by classes or series is required by the laws of the State of
Nevada, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at least a majority of
the voting power, represented in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the
proxy has authority to vote on all matters), within each such class or series
is necessary to constitute a quorum of each such class or series.

(b) If a quorum is not represented, a majority of the voting power
represented or the person presiding at the meeting may adjourn the meeting
from time to time until a quorum shall be represented. At any such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be represented, any business may be
transacted which might otherwise have been transacted at the adjourned meeting
as originally called. When a stockholders meeting is adjourned to another
time or place hereunder, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. However, if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each stockholder
of record as of the new record date. The stockholders present at a duly
convened meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the departure of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum of the voting power.

Section 2.7 _Voting_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation or any
resolution providing for the issuance of preferred stock adopted by the Board
of Directors pursuant to authority expressly vested in it by the provisions of
the Articles of Incorporation, each stockholder of record, or such
stockholders duly authorized proxy, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for
each share of voting stock standing registered in such stockholders name at
the close of business on the record date or the date established by the Board
of Directors in connection with stockholder action by written consent.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, all votes with respect to shares
(including pledged shares) standing in the name of an individual at the close
of business on the record date or the date established by the Board of
Directors in connection with stockholder action by written consent shall be
cast only by that individual or such individuals duly authorized proxy. With
respect to shares held by a representative of the estate of a deceased
stockholder, or a guardian, conservator, custodian or trustee, even though the
shares do not stand in the name of such holder, votes may be cast by such
holder upon proof of such representative capacity. In the case of shares
under the control of a receiver , the receiver may vote such shares even
though the shares do not stand of record in the name of the receiver but only
if and to the extent that the order of a court of competent jurisdiction
which appoints the receiver contains the authority to vote such shares. If
shares stand of record in the name of a minor, votes may be cast by the duly
appointed guardian of the estate of such minor only if such guardian
has provided the Corporation with written proof of such appointment.

 



4 (c) With respect to shares standing of record in the name of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity on
the record date, votes may be cast: (i) in the case of a corporation, by such
individual as the bylaws of such other corporation prescribe, by such
individual as may be appointed by resolution of the board of directors of
such other corporation or by such individual (including, without limitation,
the officer making the authorization) authorized in writing to do so by the
chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, if any, the
president or any vice president of such corporation; and (ii) in the case of a
partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity, by an individual
representing such stockholder upon presentation to the Corporation of
satisfactory evidence of his or her authority to do so.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and except for
the Corporations shares held in a fiduciary capacity, the Corporation shall
not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own stock owned or held by it,
and such shares shall not be counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares entitled to vote.

(e) Any holder of shares entitled to vote on any matter may cast a portion of
the votes in favor of such matter and refrain from casting the remaining
votes or cast the same against the proposal, except in the case of elections
of directors. If such holder entitled to vote does vote any of such
stockholders shares affirmatively and fails to specify the number of
affirmative votes, it will be conclusively presumed that the holder is casting
affirmative votes with respect to all shares held.

 

(f) With respect to shares standing of record in the name of two or more
persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint
tenants, tenants in common, husband and wife as community property, tenants
by the entirety, voting trustees or otherwise and shares held by two or more
persons (including proxy holders) having the same fiduciary relationship in
respect to the same shares, votes may be cast in the following manner:

(i) If only one person votes, the vote of such person binds all.

 

(ii) If more than one person casts votes, the act of the majority so voting
binds all.

 

(iii) If more than one person casts votes, but the vote is evenly split on a
particular matter, the votes shall be deemed cast proportionately, as split.

(g) If a quorum is present, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these
Bylaws, the NRS, or other applicable law provide for a different proportion,
action by the stockholders entitled to vote on a matter, other than the
election of directors, is approved by and is the act of the stockholders if
the number of votes cast in favor of the action exceeds the number of votes
cast in opposition to the action, unless voting by classes or series is
required for any action of the stockholders by the laws of the State of
Nevada, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in which case the
number of votes cast in favor of the action by the voting power of each such
class or series must exceed the number of votes cast in opposition to the
action by the voting power of each such class or series.

 



5 (h) If a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast.

 

Section 2.8 _Actions at Meetings Not Regularly Called; Ratification and
Approval_.

 

(a) Whenever all persons entitled to vote at any meeting consent, either by:
(i) a writing on the records of the meeting or filed with the secretary, (ii)
presence at such meeting and oral consent entered on the minutes, or (iii)
taking part in the deliberations at such meeting without objection, such
meeting shall be as valid as if a meeting were regularly called and noticed.

(b) At such meeting any business may be transacted which is not excepted from
the written consent or to the consideration of which no objection for want of
notice is made at the time.

(c) If any meeting be irregular for want of notice or of such consent,
provided a quorum was present at such meeting, the proceedings of the meeting
may be ratified and approved and rendered likewise valid and the irregularity
or defect therein waived by a writing signed by all parties having the right
to vote at such meeting. 

(d) Such consent or approval may be by proxy or power of attorney, but all
such proxies and powers of attorney must be in writing.

 

Section 2.9 _Proxies_. At any meeting of stockholders, any holder of shares
entitled to vote may designate, in a manner permitted by the laws of the
State of Nevada, another person or persons to act as a proxy or proxies. If a
stockholder designates two or more persons to act as proxies, then a majority
of those persons present at a meeting has and may exercise all of the
powers conferred by the stockholder or, if only one is present, then that one
has and may exercise all of the powers conferred by the stockholder, unless
the stockholders designation of proxy provides otherwise. Every proxy shall
continue in full force and effect until its expiration or revocation in a
manner permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.

Section 2.10  _Meetings Through Electronic Communications_. Stockholders may
participate in a meeting of the stockholders by any means of electronic
communications, videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other available
technology permitted under the NRS (including, without limitation, a
telephone conference or similar method of communication by which all
individuals participating in the meeting can hear each other) and utilized by
the Corporation. If any such means are utilized, the Corporation shall, to
the extent required under the NRS, implement reasonable measures to (a) verify
the identity of each person participating through such means as a stockholder
and (b) provide the stockholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to communicate, and to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting
in a substantially concurrent manner with such proceedings. Participation in a
meeting pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ constitutes presence in person
at the meeting.

Section 2.11 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to
be taken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting if,
before or after the action, a written consent thereto is signed by the holders
of the voting power that would be required to

 



6  approve such action at a meeting. A meeting of the stockholders need not be
called or noticed whenever action is taken by written consent. The written
consent may be signed in multiple counterparts, including, without
limitation, facsimile counterparts, and shall be filed with the minutes of the
proceedings of the stockholders.

 

Section 2.12 _Organization_.

 

(a) Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chairman of the
board, or, in the absence of the chairman, by the vice chairman of the board,
if any, or if there be no vice chairman or in the absence of the vice
chairman, by the chief executive officer, if any, or if there be no chief
executive officer or in the absence of the chief executive officer, by the
president, or, in the absence of the president, or, in the absence of any of
the foregoing persons, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or,
in the absence of such designation by the Board of Directors, by a chairman
chosen at the meeting by the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the
votes which all stockholders present in person or by proxy are entitled to
cast. The secretary, or in the absence of the secretary an assistant
secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the
secretary and any assistant secretary the chairman of the meeting may appoint
any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The order of business at each
such meeting shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting.
The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as
are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including,
without limitation, (i) the establishment of procedures for the maintenance
of order and safety, (ii) limitation on participation in the meeting to
stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman of the meeting
shall permit, (iii) limitation on the time allotted for consideration of each
agenda item and for questions or comments by meeting participants, (iv)
restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the
commencement thereof and (v) the opening and closing of the voting polls. The
Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting, in his
or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be
cast by written ballot.

(b) The chairman of the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of
elections. The inspector or inspectors may (i) ascertain the number of shares
outstanding and the voting power of each; (ii) determine the number of shares
represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies or ballots; (iii) count
all votes and ballots; (iv) determine any challenges made to any
determination made by the inspector(s); and (v) certify the determination of
the number of shares represented at the meeting and the count of all votes and
ballots.

 

Section 2.13 _Absentees  Consent to Meetings_. Transactions of any meeting of
the stockholders are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after
regular call and notice if a quorum is represented, either in person or by
proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons
entitled to vote, not represented in person or by proxy (and those
who, although present, either object at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting has not been lawfully called
or convened or expressly object at the meeting to the consideration of matters
not included in the notice which are legally or by the terms of these Bylaws
required to be included therein), signs a written waiver of notice and/or
consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.
All such waivers, consents, and 

 



7  approvals shall be filed with the corporate records and made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called, noticed or convened and except that attendance
at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of
matters not properly included in the notice, to the extent such notice is
required, if such objection is expressly made at the time any such matters are
presented at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor
the purpose of any regular or special meeting of stockholders need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or consent, except as otherwise
provided in these Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE III

_DIRECTORS_

 

Section 3.1 _General Powers; Performance of Duties_. The business and affairs
of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 78 of the NRS or the
Articles of Incorporation.

 

Section 3.2 _Number, Tenure, and Qualifications_. The number of directors may
be established and changed from time to time by resolution adopted by the
Board of Directors or the stockholders without amendment to these Bylaws or
the Articles of Incorporation, and in no case shall be less than one (1)
individual. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor shall
be elected or appointed and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
retirement, disqualification, resignation or removal. No reduction of the
number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to
the expiration of his or her term of office. No provision of this _Section_
__ _ 3.2_ shall restrict the right of the Board of Directors to fill
vacancies or the right of the stockholders to remove directors as is
hereinafter provided. 

Section 3.3 _Chairman of the Board_. The Board of Directors may elect a
chairman of the board from the members of the Board of Directors, who shall
preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and stockholders at which he
or she shall be present and shall have and may exercise such powers as may,
from time to time, be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors, these
Bylaws or as provided by law. If no chairman of the board is appointed or if
the chairman is absent from a Board meeting, then the Board of Directors may
appoint a chairman for the sole purpose of presiding at any such meeting. If
no chairman of the board is appointed or if the chairman is absent from any
stockholder meeting, then the president shall preside at such stockholder
meeting. If the president is absent from any stockholder meeting, the
stockholders may appoint a substitute chairman solely for the purpose of
presiding over such stockholder meeting.

Section 3.4 _Removal and Resignation of Directors_. Subject to any rights of
the holders of preferred stock, if any, and except as otherwise provided in
the NRS, any director may be removed from office with or without cause by the
affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the
voting power of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors (voting as a single class),
excluding stock entitled to vote only upon the happening of a fact or event
unless such fact or event shall have occurred. Any director may resign
effective upon giving written notice, unless the notice specifies a later time
for effectiveness of such resignation, to the chairman of the board, if any,
the president or the secretary, or in the absence of all of them, any other
officer of the Corporation.

 



8 Section 3.5 _Vacancies; Newly Created Directorships_. Subject to any rights of
the holders of preferred stock, if any, any vacancies on the Board of
Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification,
removal from office, or other cause, and newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled by a
majority vote of the directors then in office or by a sole remaining director,
in either case though less than a quorum, and the director(s) so chosen shall
hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders
and when their successors are elected or appointed, at which the term of the
class to which he or she has been elected expires, or until his or her earlier
resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting
the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent directors.

Section 3.6 _Annual and Regular Meetings_. Immediately following the
adjournment of, and at the same place as, the annual or any special meeting of
the stockholders at which directors are elected, the Board of Directors,
including directors newly elected, shall hold its annual meeting without call
or notice, other than this provision, to elect officers and to transact such
further business as may be necessary or appropriate. The Board of Directors
may provide by resolution the place, date, and hour for holding
regular meetings between annual meetings, and if the Board of Directors so
provides with respect to a regular meeting, notice of such regular meeting
shall not be required.

 

Section 3.7 _Special Meetings_. Subject to any rights of the holders of
preferred stock, if any, and except as otherwise required by law, special
meetings of the Board of Directors may be called only by the chairman of the
board, if any, or if there be no chairman of the board, by the chief executive
officer, if any, or by the president or the secretary, and shall be called
by the chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, if any,
the president, or the secretary upon the request of at least a majority of the
Board of Directors. If the chairman of the board, or if there be no chairman
of the board, each of the chief executive officer, the president, and the
secretary, fails for any reason to call such special meeting, a special
meeting may be called by a notice signed by at least a majority of the Board
of Directors.

 

Section 3.8 _Place of Meetings_. Any regular or special meeting of the Board
of Directors may be held at such place as the Board of Directors, or in the
absence of such designation, as the notice calling such meeting, may
designate. A waiver of notice signed by the directors may designate any place
for the holding of such meeting.

 

Section 3.9 _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __
_ 3.6_, there shall be delivered to each director at the address appearing
for him or her on the records of the Corporation, at least twenty-four (24)
hours before the time of such meeting, a copy of a written notice of any
meeting (i) by delivery of such notice personally, (ii) by mailing such
notice postage prepaid, (iii) by facsimile, (iv) by overnight courier, (v) by
telegram, or (vi) by electronic transmission or electronic writing, including,
without limitation, e-mail. If mailed to an address inside the United States,
the notice shall be deemed delivered two (2) business days following

 



9  the date the same is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid.
If mailed to an address outside the United States, the notice shall be deemed
delivered four (4) business days following the date the same is deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid. If sent via overnight courier, the
notice shall be deemed delivered the business day following the delivery of
such notice to the courier. If sent via facsimile, the notice shall be deemed
delivered upon senders receipt of confirmation of the successful
transmission. If sent by electronic transmission (including, without
limitation, e-mail), the notice shall be deemed delivered when directed to
the e-mail address of the director appearing on the records of the Corporation
and otherwise pursuant to the applicable provisions of NRS Chapter 75. If the
address of any director is incomplete or does not appear upon the records of
the Corporation it will be sufficient to address any notice to such director

the Corporation may be a party, be issued in such manner, at such times, upon
such conditions and for such consideration as shall be prescribed by the
Board of Directors.

Section 5.2 _Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares_.

 

(a) Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be entitled to have a
certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by (i) the chief
executive officer, if any, the president or a vice president, and (ii) the
secretary, an assistant secretary, the treasurer or the chief financial
officer, if any, of the Corporation (or any other two officers or agents
so authorized by the Board of Directors), certifying the number of shares of
stock owned by him, her or it in the Corporation; provided that the Board of
Directors may authorize the issuance of uncertificated shares of some or all
of any or all classes or series of the Corporations stock. Any such issuance
of uncertificated shares shall have no effect on existing certificates for
shares until such certificates are surrendered to the Corporation, or on the
respective rights and obligations of the stockholders. Whenever any such
certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or
a transfer clerk and by a registrar (other than the Corporation), then a
facsimile of the signatures of any corporate officers or agents, the transfer
agent, transfer clerk or the registrar of the Corporation may be printed or
lithographed upon the certificate in lieu of the

 



14  actual signatures. In the event that any officer or officers who have

certificates for stock cease to be an officer or officers because of death,
resignation or other reason, before the certificate or certificates for stock
have been delivered by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates may
nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as
though the person or persons who signed the certificate or certificates, or
whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon, had not ceased
to be an officer or officers of the Corporation.

 

(b) Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written
statement certifying the number and class (and the designation of the series,
if any) of the shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation and any
restrictions on the transfer or registration of such shares imposed by
the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any agreement among stockholders
or any agreement between the stockholders and the Corporation, and, at least
annually thereafter, the Corporation shall provide to such stockholders of
record holding uncertificated shares, a written statement confirming the
information contained in such written statement previously sent. Except as
otherwise expressly provided by the NRS, the rights and obligations of the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be identical whether or not their
shares of stock are represented by certificates.

(c) Each certificate representing shares shall state the following upon the
face thereof: the name of the state of the Corporations organization; the
name of the person to whom issued; the number and class of shares and the
designation of the series, if any, which such certificate represents; the par
value of each share, if any, represented by such certificate or a statement
that the shares are without par value. Certificates of stock shall be in such
form consistent with law as shall be prescribed by the Board of Directors. No
certificate shall be issued until the shares represented thereby are fully
paid. In addition to the foregoing, all certificates evidencing shares of the

stock, shall be canceled and no new certificate shall be issued until the
former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been canceled,
except that in case of a lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate, a
new one may be issued therefor. However, any stockholder applying for the
issuance of a stock certificate in lieu of one alleged to have been lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall, prior to the issuance of a replacement,
provide the Corporation with his, her or its affidavit of the facts
surrounding the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation and, if required by the
Board of Directors, an indemnity bond in an amount not less than twice the
current market value of the stock, and upon such terms as the treasurer or
the Board of Directors shall require which shall indemnify the Corporation
against any loss, damage, cost or inconvenience arising as a consequence of
the issuance of a replacement certificate.

 



15 Section 5.4 _Replacement Certificate_. When the Articles of Incorporation are
amended in any way affecting the statements contained in the certificates for
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation or it becomes desirable
for any reason, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, including,
without limitation, the merger of the Corporation with another Corporation or
the conversion or reorganization of the Corporation, to cancel any outstanding
certificate for shares and issue a new certificate therefor conforming to the
rights of the holder, the Board of Directors may order any holders of
outstanding certificates for shares to surrender and exchange the same for new
certificates within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Board of Directors.
The order may provide that a holder of any certificate(s) ordered to be
surrendered shall not be entitled to vote, receive distributions or exercise
any other rights of stockholders of record until the holder has complied with
the order, but the order operates to suspend such rights only after notice
and until compliance.

Section 5.5 _Transfer of Shares_. No transfer of stock shall be valid as
against the Corporation except on surrender and cancellation of any
certificate(s) therefor accompanied by an assignment or transfer by the
registered owner made either in person or under assignment. Upon receipt of
proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated
shares, such uncertificated shares shall be cancelled and issuance of new,
equivalent uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the
stockholder entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded on the
transfer books of the Corporation. Whenever any transfer shall be expressly
made for collateral security and not absolutely, the collateral nature of the
transfer shall be reflected in the entry of transfer in the records of the
Corporation.

 

Section 5.6 _Transfer Agent; Registrars_. The Board of Directors may appoint
one or more transfer agents, transfer clerks and registrars of transfer and
may require all certificates for shares of stock to bear the signature of such
transfer agents, transfer clerks and/or registrars of transfer.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification of Directors and Officers._

 

(i) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , (A) " _Indemnitee_ " shall mean each
director or officer who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a
party to, or is otherwise involved in, any Proceeding (as hereinafter
defined), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation (or was a director, officer, partner, member, manager or
managing member of its predecessor entity, if any), or is or was serving in
any capacity at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent, partner, member, manager or fiduciary of, or in any other
capacity for, another corporation or any partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust, or other enterprise; and (B) " _Proceeding_ " shall
mean any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding
(including, without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the
right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative.

 

(ii) Each Indemnitee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation
to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada against
all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, taxes, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by the Indemnitee in
connection with any Proceeding; provided that such Indemnitee either is not
liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner such
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation and, with respect to any Proceeding that is criminal in
nature, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not, of
itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee is liable pursuant to NRS
78.138 or did not act in good faith and in a manner in which he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, or that, with respect to any criminal proceeding, he or she
had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee for any claim, issue or matter
as to which the Indemnitee has been adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction,

 



17  after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation
or for any amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation, unless and only to
the extent that the court in which the Proceeding was brought or other court
of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the
circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such amounts as the court deems proper. Except as so ordered by
a court and for advancement of expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
indemnification may not be made to or on behalf of an Indemnitee if a final
adjudication establishes that his or her acts or omissions involved
intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law and was material
to the cause of action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
these Bylaws, no director or officer may be indemnified for expenses incurred
in defending any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding
(including without limitation, an action, suit or proceeding by or in the
right of the Corporation), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, that such director or officer incurred in his or her capacity
as a stockholder.

(iii) Indemnification pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Corporation (or director, officer, partner, member, manager or managing member
of its predecessor entity, if any), or a director, officer, employee, agent,
partner, member, manager or fiduciary of, or to serve in any other capacity
for, another corporation or any partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, or other enterprise and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors and administrators.

(iv) The expenses of Indemnitees must be paid by the Corporation or
through insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation or through
other financial arrangements made by the Corporation, as such expenses are
incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding, upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay the
amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. To the
extent that an Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any Proceeding, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
the Corporation shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including
attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred in by him or her
in connection with the defense.

(b) _Indemnification of Employees and Other Persons_. The Corporation may, by
action of its Board of Directors and to the extent provided in such action,
indemnify employees and other persons as though they were Indemnitees.

(c) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification provided in
this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors,
or otherwise.

(d) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or make
other financial arrangements on behalf of any Indemnitee for any liability
asserted against him or her and liability and expenses incurred by him or her
in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, managing
member or agent, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation has the authority to indemnify him or her against such
liability and expenses.

 



18 (e) _Other Financial Arrangements_. The other financial arrangements which may
be made by the Corporation may include the following: (i) the creation of a
trust fund; (ii) the establishment of a program of self-insurance; (iii) the
securing of its obligation of indemnification by granting a security interest
or other lien on any assets of the Corporation; and (iv) the establishment of
a letter of credit, guarantee or surety. No financial arrangement made
pursuant to this subsection may provide protection for a person adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom,
to be liable for intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of law,
except with respect to advancement of expenses or indemnification ordered by a
court.

 

(f) _Other Matters Relating to Insurance or Financial Arrangements_. Any
insurance or other financial arrangement made on behalf of a person pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ may be provided by the Corporation or any other
person approved by the Board of Directors, even if all or part of the other
persons stock or other securities is owned by the Corporation. In the
absence of fraud, (i) the decision of the Board of Directors as to the
propriety of the terms and conditions of any insurance or other financial
arrangement made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and the choice of the
person to provide the insurance or other financial arrangement is conclusive;
and (ii) the insurance or other financial arrangement is not void or voidable
and does not subject any director approving it to personal liability for his
action; even if a director approving the insurance or other financial
arrangement is a beneficiary of the insurance or other financial arrangement.

 

Section 8.2 _Amendment_. The provisions of this _Article VIII_ relating to
indemnification shall constitute a contract between the Corporation and each
of its directors and officers which may be modified as to any director or
officer only with that persons consent or as specifically provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws
relating to their amendment generally, any repeal or amendment of this
_Article VIII_ which is adverse to any director or officer shall apply to such
director or officer only on a prospective basis, and shall not limit the
rights of an Indemnitee to indemnification with respect to any action or
failure to act occurring prior to the time of such repeal or amendment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws (including, without
limitation, _Article X_ ), no repeal or amendment of these Bylaws shall
affect any or all of this _Article VIII_ so as to limit or reduce the
indemnification in any manner unless adopted by (i) the unanimous vote of the
directors of the Corporation then serving, or (ii) by the stockholders as set
forth in _Article X_ ; provided that no such amendment shall have a
retroactive effect inconsistent with the preceding sentence.

 

ARTICLE IX

_CHANGES IN NEVADA LAW_

References in these Bylaws to the laws of the State of Nevada or the NRS or to
any provision thereof shall be to such law as it existed on the date these
Bylaws were adopted or as such law thereafter may be changed; provided that
(i) in the case of any change which expands the liability of directors or
officers or limits the indemnification rights or the rights to advancement of
expenses which the Corporation may provide in _Article VIII_ , the rights to

 



19  limited liability, to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
provided in the Articles of Incorporation and/or these Bylaws shall continue
as theretofore to the extent permitted by law and (ii) if such change permits
the Corporation, without the requirement of any further action by stockholders
or directors, to limit further the liability of directors or limit the
liability of officers or to provide broader indemnification rights or rights
to the advancement of expenses than the Corporation was permitted to provide
prior to such change, then liability thereupon shall be so limited and the
rights to indemnification and the advancement of expenses shall be so
broadened to the extent permitted by law.

ARTICLE X

 

 _AMENDMENT OR REPEAL_

 

Section 10.1 _Amendment of Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Board of Directors_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to amend
