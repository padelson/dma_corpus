(c) _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a notice (an
"Adjustment Notice"), which shall include a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Proposed Balance Sheet"
and, in its final and binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant
to this _Section 2.04_, the "Final Balance Sheet") setting forth its
calculation of (i) the actual Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "Proposed
Net Working Capital", and, in its final and binding form after resolution of
any disputes pursuant to this _Section 2.04_, the "Final Net Working
Capital"); and (ii) the actual Cash Amount of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Proposed Cash Amount", and, in its
final and binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant to this
_Section 2.04_, the "Final Cash Amount"), together with supporting
calculations and work papers to the extent reasonably available and utilized
in the preparation of the Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working
Capital, and Proposed Cash Amount. Seller shall have a period of thirty (30)
days (the "Objection Period") after receipt of the Adjustment Notice in which
to provide written notice to Buyer of any objections thereto (the "Objection
Notice"), and such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the item of
the Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital, or Proposed Cash
Amount to which each such objection relates and the basis for each such
objection and the dollar

 



16  amount of any dispute so asserted, together with Sellers calculation of
each disputed item and supporting calculations and information. If Seller
provides any such Objection Notice within the Objection Period, then Seller
and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute concerning the
item(s) subject to such Objection Notice. If Seller and Buyer do not resolve
any dispute arising in connection with or relating to the Proposed Balance
Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital, or Proposed Cash Amount within thirty
(30) days after the date of delivery of the Objection Notice, which 30-day
period may be extended by written agreement of Seller and Buyer (such period,
as it may be extended, the "Initial Resolution Period"), such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.04(d)_.
The Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital, and Proposed Cash
Amount shall be deemed to be accepted by Seller, and shall become final and
binding on the parties hereto on the earlier of (x) the expiration of the
Objection Period without delivery to Buyer of an Objection Notice or (y) the
date on which all objections provided for in a timely delivered Objection
Notice have been resolved by the parties or the Reviewing Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Seller does not deliver to Buyer an Objection Notice
within the Objection Period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital, and Proposed Cash Amount
without any further action on the part of Seller or Buyer, and the
Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital, and Proposed Cash
Amount delivered by Buyer in accordance with this _Section 2.04(c)_ shall be
the Final Balance Sheet, Final Net Working Capital and Final Cash Amount.

 

(d) _Dispute Resolution Mechanism_. If Seller and Buyer have been unable to
resolve the matters set forth in the Objection Notice within the Initial
Resolution Period, either party may submit such remaining disputed matters to,
and such remaining disputed matters shall be fully, finally, and exclusively
resolved by Duff and Phelps (the "Independent Accountant"), or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act, any nationally or regionally recognized
independent accounting firm as reasonably agreed to by Seller and Buyer (the
"Alternate Accountant"). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
or the Alternate Accountant (as the case may be, the "Reviewing Party")
incurred in the resolution of the disputed matter(s) set forth in the
Objection Notice shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. In the event of
a dispute involving an Objection Notice, the Reviewing Party shall determine
(and written notice thereof shall be given to Seller and Buyer) as promptly as
practicable following the date on which the Proposed Balance Sheet and other
items required in connection therewith as specified in _Section 2.04(c)_
above are delivered to the Reviewing Party, based solely on written
submissions detailing the disputed items and forwarded to it, only with
respect to the disputed items submitted to the Reviewing Party, whether and
to what extent (if any) the Proposed Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working
Capital, or Proposed Cash Amount require adjustment, and provide a written
explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment, including
the basis therefor. The Reviewing Party shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the parties and its decision for each disputed item must be
in the range of values assigned to each such item by Seller and Buyer at the
time of the retention of the Reviewing Party. The procedures of this _Section
2.04(d)_ are exclusive and the determination of the Reviewing Party shall be
final and binding. The decision rendered pursuant to this  _Section 2.04(d)_
may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 



17 (e) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_. In the event that: (i)(A) the
Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then
the Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount
equal to such deficit, or (B) the Final Net Working Capital is greater than
the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be increased
on a dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount equal to such surplus; and (ii)(A)
the Final Cash Amount is less than the Estimated Cash Amount, then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount
equal to such deficit, or (B) the Final Cash Amount is greater than the
Estimated Cash Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount equal to such surplus. The net amount of
the adjustments to the Purchase Price under this  _Section 2.04(e)_ shall be
the "Purchase Price Adjustment Deficit" if the net amount of the adjustments
would, in the aggregate, reduce the Purchase Price hereunder, or the "Purchase
Price Adjustment Surplus" if the net amount of the adjustments would, in the
aggregate, increase the Purchase Price hereunder.

(f) _Payment Regarding Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Within three (3)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Balance Sheet, Final Net
Working Capital, and Final Cash Amount in accordance with this _Section
2.04_, (i) if there is a Purchase Price Adjustment Deficit, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to such Purchase Price Adjustment Deficit or (ii) if there is a Purchase
Price Adjustment Surplus, Buyer shall make payment to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, of an amount equal to the Purchase
Price Adjustment Surplus. Any amount that is paid pursuant to this _Section
2.04(f)_ shall be treated by the parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment of
the Purchase Price.

Section 2.05 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis time,
on the date that is the later of (i) the date that is three (3) Business Days
after the last of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have
been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to waive such conditions (to
the extent permissible under Law) (other than conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permissible under Law) of such
conditions by the party entitled to waive such conditions at the Closing) and
(ii) the earlier of (A) the date that is three (3) Business Days following
the last day of the Marketing Period and (B) the date on which Buyer delivers
written notice to Seller waiving this clause (ii) (which waiver may be subject
to consummation of the Debt Financing;  _provided_ , that any such waiver
shall in no way extend the period of time set forth in clause (ii)(A) above)
(but, in any event, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permissible under Law) by the party entitled to waive such conditions of the
conditions set forth in in _Article VI_ at the Closing), at the offices of
Briggs and Morgan, P.A., 2200 IDS Center, 80 South Eighth Street, Minneapolis,
MN 55402, or at such other time or on such other date or at such other place
as Seller and Buyer may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the
Closing takes place being the "Closing Date").

 

Section 2.06 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made to Seller or
any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net of any
Taxes required by applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment
and (b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be
remitted to the applicable taxing authority and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller or its Affiliates.

 



18 Section 2.07 Direct Foreign Purchases.

 

(a) Buyer shall have the right to elect to separately purchase prior to the
Closing from the Company and its Subsidiaries the stock or other equity
interests of one Subsidiary of the Company selected by Buyer that is organized
in each of the following jurisdictions: Canada, France, United Kingdom and
Australia (for a total of four such Subsidiaries) (each, a "Non-US Entity")
and may assign such right to any, or multiple, of its Subsidiaries. If Buyer
makes such election, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the aggregate
amounts paid for the Non-US Entities by Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Any
such purchase shall be for an amount that the parties mutually agree
represents the fair market value of such Non-US Entities. Notwithstanding any
exercise of such right by Buyer, the Non-US Entities shall nonetheless be
deemed to be Subsidiaries of the Company for purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (other than the
reduction set forth above in this Section 2.07) and Articles III through VIII.

 

(b) Prior to Closing, Seller will (and will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to) and Buyer will work together in good faith to reasonably
estimate and ultimately agree upon the incremental costs that would be
incurred by Seller, if any, if the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries exercise
the election described in _Section 2.07(a)_, or any relevant portion
thereof. Seller will (and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) and
Buyer will also work together in good faith to reasonably estimate and
ultimately agree upon the amount of cash in addition to the Purchase Price
required to be paid by Buyer to Seller so that if Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries exercise the election in _Section 2.07(a)_, or any portion
thereof, Seller shall be in a net after Tax position following such exercise
that is no less favorable than it would have been in if the election, or
relevant portion thereof, were never made (the "Gross Up"). If Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries make the election, or any portion thereof, described in
_Section 2.07(a)_ then Buyer shall be required to pay or cause to be paid
the Gross Up (or relevant portion thereof) to Seller at Closing. In the event
Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the amount of the incremental cost of the
Gross UP described herein, the differences shall be resolved in accordance
with the method set forth in _Section 2.04(d)_ hereof.

(c) Buyer and Seller will work together in good faith to approve a budget for
the reasonable out-of-pocket legal, accounting, consulting, and other similar
costs that Seller will incur to perform any analysis and document any of the
transactions required by this _Section 2.07_ and Buyer will reimburse Seller
for such costs.

with their related documentation. To Sellers Knowledge, the IT Systems owned
by the Company and its Subsidiaries do not contain any Malware that would
reasonably be expected to interfere with the ability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to conduct the Business. In the past three (3) years,

information and protected health information. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have implemented reasonable back-up measures and business continuity measures
to aid the continued operation of their business in the event of a disaster

Disclosure Schedules lists each Insurance Policy. There is no material claim
by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company pending
under any Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied

Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to any access or information provided pursuant to this _Section
5.02_.

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in any
event on or before August 31, 2015, or, if earlier, within 2 Business Days
following receipt by the Company), Seller will furnish or cause to be
furnished to Buyer a copy of the Companys audited combined financial
statements consisting of the balance sheet of the Company as of April 25, 2015
and the related combined statements of income, net parent investment and cash
flows for the year then ended (the "2015 Audited Financial Statements").

 

Section 5.03 Supplement to Disclosure Schedules. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto with respect to any
matter hereafter arising or of which it becomes aware after the date hereof
promptly after it obtains awareness thereof (each a "Schedule Supplement").
Any disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have
cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.02_ have been satisfied; _provided, however_ , that
if the disclosure made in such Schedule Supplement gives Buyer the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ and Seller irrevocably
states in such Schedule Supplement that the supplement or amendment contained
therein gives Buyer the unilateral right to terminate this Agreement and Buyer
does not elect to terminate this Agreement within ten Business Days of its
receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such
matter and, further, shall have irrevocably waived its right to
indemnification under _Section 7.02_ with respect to such matter.

 

Section 5.04 Resignations. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
written resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and
directors of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries requested by Buyer at
least five Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

Section 5.05 Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and thereafter, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company to, comply with the terms of the Company Benefit
Plans. During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date
which is twelve (12) months from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of an
Employees termination of employment with the Company 

 



36  or its Subsidiaries), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to provide
each Employee who remains employed, and each employee of Seller who becomes
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries, immediately after the Closing
("Company Continuing Employee") with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which
are not materially less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) severance benefits that are
not materially less favorable than the practice, plan or policy in effect for
such Company Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; provided,
that for those Company Continuing Employees who are represented by a union or
a works council as of the Closing Date, the compensation and benefits will be
subject in all respects to the applicable collective bargaining, works council
or similar agreement and not the other commitments provided in this _Section
5.05(a)_.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in which any Company
Continuing Employee will participate effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries to, recognize all
service of the Company Continuing Employees with Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Buyer,
for vesting and eligibility purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan; _provided,
however_ , such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits, (y) such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan or (z) it relates to
vesting of future equity awards.

 

(c) This _Section 5.05_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
5.05_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.05_.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or limit the Companys or the Companys Subsidiaries ability to amend, modify
or terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement;
_provided_ that Buyer otherwise meets its obligations under _Section 5.05(a)_
and _Section 5.05(b)_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this _Section 5.05_ shall not create any right in any
Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

(d) Seller, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries shall take such actions
prior to the Closing Date as are necessary to comply with applicable works
councils, collective bargaining agreements or other labor contracts and other
labor Laws applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall use reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with copies of
any communications or notices provided to or responses received from any such
works councils or unions.

Section 5.06 Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. At the Closing, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a true and correct list, by date and location, of all
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose employment is
terminated (other than for cause) in the 90-day period immediately preceding
the Closing Date. For a period of 90 days immediately following the Closing,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
not to, take any action following the Closing that could result in WARN Act
liability for Seller.

 



37 Section 5.07 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to carry the
Insurance Policies through the Closing, and Seller shall not amend or modify
the Insurance Policies or allow any breach, default or cancellation (other
than expiration and replacement of policies in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices) of such Insurance Policies to occur or exist.
Except as otherwise provided by this _Section 5.07_, Buyer acknowledges that
from and after the Closing none of Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have coverage under any of Sellers insurance policies.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that with respects to acts, omissions, events
or circumstances relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing that are covered by Insurance
Policies that are occurrence-based policies or claims known or reported to
insurers covered by Insurance Policies that are claims-made policies under
which policies any of the Company or its Subsidiaries is an insured on or
prior to Closing, the Company or such Subsidiary may make claims under such
policies subject to the terms and conditions of such policies and this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to make claims or seek
coverage under the Insurance Policies for any covered claims incurred prior
to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall remain responsible,
without recourse to the Company and its Subsidiaries or Buyer, for the
deductible or self-insured retention amount for any pre-close insurance
claims (regardless of when the claim is presented) covered under any Seller
insurance policy.

(b) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries now existing in
favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, as provided in the charter
or by-laws of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect on the date hereof, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect
on the date hereof set forth on _Section 5.07(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(c) Buyer shall cause the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to, obtain
effective as of the Closing Date pre-paid directors and officers liability
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date and providing coverage for claims arising out of or relating to
events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), with at least the same
coverage and limits, and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries, as the directors and officers liability insurance policy in
place immediately prior to the Closing Date and covering such directors and
officers; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for
such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_
"). The Maximum Premium is set forth on _Schedule 5.07(c)_. If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than
the Maximum Premium, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries shall obtain,
and Buyer shall cause them to obtain, that amount of pre-paid directors and
officers liability "tail" insurance policies obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



38 (d) The obligations of Buyer, the Company, and the Companys Subsidiaries
under this  _Section 5.07_ shall not be terminated or modified in any manner
as to adversely affect any director or officer to whom this _Section 5.07_
applies without the consent of such affected director or officer (it being
expressly agreed that the directors and officers to whom this _Section 5.07_
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.07_, each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this  _Section 5.07_).

(e) In the event Buyer, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Buyer, the Company, or the Companys Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.07_.

Section 5.08 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and shall continue
in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time it shall
automatically terminate and, in addition, covenants and agrees to keep
confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section 5.08_
shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with the
terms thereof. Until the second anniversary of the Closing Date: (i) Seller
shall, and shall cause its respective controlled Affiliates and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries related to Sellers
ownership of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and (ii)
Buyer shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and Representatives
to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other information of or
relating to Seller (other than information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries) related to Buyers ownership of the Company and
its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, except, in each case, to the
extent that the applicable party is required to disclose such information by
judicial or administrative process or pursuant to applicable Law or such
information can be shown to have been in the public domain through no fault
of the applicable party.

Section 5.09 Governmental Approvals and Other Third-party Consents.

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party
shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Representatives and
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees not take any action that is
reasonably likely to have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. Each
party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act and
any applicable foreign antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within five Business Days after the date hereof
(including a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act) and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

 



39 (b) Without limiting the generality of Buyers undertaking pursuant to this 
_Section 5.09_, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible. In addition, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the consummation of the Closing.

 

(c) Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, all analyses,
appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of either
party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including, any interactions
between Seller, the Company, or the Companys Subsidiaries with Governmental
Authorities in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
or any disclosure which is not permitted by Law) shall be disclosed to the
other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it
being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other
party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact.

 

(d) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to give all notices to, and
obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in  _Section
3.05_ of the Disclosure Schedules. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that
are described in _Section 4.02_ of the Disclosure Schedules;  _provided,
however_ , that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration
therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested.

 

Section 5.10 Books and Records.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,
for a period of three years after the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing in a
manner reasonably consistent with the prior practices of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries; and

 



40 (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Seller
reasonable access (including the right to make, at Sellers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer or the Company after the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose, for a period of three years following the Closing, Seller
shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of Seller which
relate to the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and their operations for
periods prior to the Closing; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer or the
Company reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

 

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this _Section 5.10_ where such access would (x) jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege; or (y) contravene any applicable Law.

 

Section 5.11 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
party hereto shall, and Seller shall cause the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ hereof that are for the benefit of the other party.

Section 5.12 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a release
mutually agreed to by Seller and Buyer; provided that, if Seller and Buyer
cannot agree on a press release, either party may make such press release and
disclose such information as it reasonably deems necessary to timely comply
with applicable Law, the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or the stock exchange requirements to which it is subject.
Thereafter, each of Buyer and Seller agree that it will make no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except such release or
announcement as may be required by applicable Law, the rules or regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the stock exchange requirements
to which it is subject, and Buyer may disclose such information as it
reasonably deems necessary and appropriate to its and its Affiliates current
and prospective direct and indirect investors.

Section 5.13 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances,
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



41 Section 5.14 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at
its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Transfer Taxes (and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with respect
thereto as necessary). 

Section 5.15 Lease Guarantees. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
pursuant to the Lease Guarantees, Seller has guaranteed Patterson Medical
Supply, Inc.s obligations under the Guaranteed Leases. Seller and Buyer
hereby covenant and agree that they will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (a) terminate each Lease Guarantee or (b) have Seller removed as a
party to each Lease Guarantee (either outcome with respect to a Lease
Guarantee, a "Lease Guarantee Termination"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall not be required to incur any Indebtedness or obligations or out-
of-pocket costs or expenses or pay or deposit any consideration to or with any
Person in connection with any Lease Guarantee Termination.

Section 5.16 Seller Financing Cooperation. Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives (including independent public accountants and
attorneys) (with appropriate seniority and expertise) to use their reasonable
best efforts to, provide on a timely basis all such reasonable assistance and
cooperation in connection with the Financing (which for purposes of this
_Section 5.16_ includes any Alternate Financing) as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer, which shall include the actions set forth on Exhibit D.
The Seller (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby consents to and
authorizes (i) the use of the Required Information, and as of the date hereof,
the Seller and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any limitation on the use of
such financial statements required by Ernst and Young LLP or its Affiliates and
(ii) the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos, trademarks and
trade names in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters; _provided_ , that such logos, trademarks and trade names
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to,
harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.17 Non-Competition. Seller agrees that for the period from the
Closing Date until the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall
not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in a
business competitive to the Business anywhere in the world (each, a
"Competitive Activity"); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit
Seller or any of its Affiliates from collectively owning up to an aggregate of
five percent of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of any
Person that engages in any Competitive Activity (a "Competing Person") so
long as neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has any participation in the
management of such Competing Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.18_ shall prohibit Seller or
any of its Affiliates from acquiring the whole or any part of a Person or
business which engages in any Competitive Activity or the whole or any part of
a business which includes any Competitive Activity; _provided_ that where
such Competitive Activities of such Person or business represent greater than
25% of the revenues of such Person or business acquired as set out in the
latest available annual financial statements of that Person or business,
Seller and/or its Affiliates shall divest such Person, business or portion
thereof to the extent engaging in such Competitive Activity within six months
after the consummation of such acquisition.

 



42 Section 5.18 Non-Solicitation. Seller agrees that from and after the date of
this Agreement until the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit
for employment or hire any Person who is at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply (i)
to solicitations made by job opportunity advertisements and headhunter
searches directed to the general public rather than targeting any employees
of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) with respect to any employee who has been terminated by
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

Section 5.19 Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on a timely basis (taking
into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) on terms and
conditions not less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the applicable
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions that are contained in the Fee Letter), including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the applicable Commitment Letters
(subject to Buyers right to replace, restate, supplement, modify, assign,
substitute or amend the Commitment Letters in accordance herewith), (ii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on
conditions no less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (including any such "market flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letter), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis
(taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) or obtain
the waiver of all conditions applicable to Buyer contained in the applicable
Commitment Letters (or any definitive agreements related thereto) that are
within Buyers control and (iv) consummate the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter substantially concurrently with the
Closing. Buyer shall keep Seller informed upon request on a reasonable basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice upon having knowledge of
any material breach by any party of any of the Commitment Letters or any
termination of any of the Commitment Letters.

(b) Other than as set forth in _Section 5.19(c)_, prior to Closing, Buyer
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, amend, modify,
supplement or waive any provision of the Commitment Letters or the Fee Letter
to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Commitment
Letters below an amount that, when combined with Buyers other sources of
funds, will be sufficient for Buyer to perform its obligations hereunder or
(ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend or modify any of
the conditions, to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (A) make the funding of the Financing (or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or (B) materially delay the Closing; provided that Buyer may amend,
supplement, or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, or similar entities (or
titles with respect to such entities) (it being understood that the aggregate
commitments of the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter prior to such
amendment, supplement or modification may be reduced in the amount of such
additional partys commitments). Upon any such amendment, supplement or
modification of the Equity Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with this _Section 5.19_, the term "Equity Commitment Letter" or
"Debt Commitment Letter", as applicable thereto, shall mean such Commitment
Letter as so amended, supplemented or modified.

 



43 (c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions that are contained in the Fee Letter)
(other than as a result of Sellers breach of any material provision of this
Agreement, or failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_
or _Section 6.02_), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from
alternative sources, which may include one or more of a senior secured debt
financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and
sale of other debt securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount such
that the aggregate funds that would be available to Buyer at the Closing,
when combined with Buyers other sources of funds, will be sufficient to
perform its obligations hereunder ("Alternative Financing"); provided that
Buyer shall not be required to arrange or obtain any Alternative Financing
having terms and conditions (including "market flex" provisions) less
favorable to Buyer in any material respect than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. In such event, the term "Debt
Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Financing (and consequently the term "Financing" shall include the
Equity Financing and the Alternative Financing), and the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the
commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Financing. In addition to
and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, as promptly as practicable, the Required Information.

(d) At or immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i)
payoff letters or other instruments of discharge or release reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer (including releases and discharges of any Encumbrances
relating thereto) that release the Company, its Subsidiaries,
their respective assets and the Shares from the Existing Company Debt, (ii)
the originals of the pledged collateral in the possession of any counterparty
to any such Indebtedness and (iii) any and all officers certificates required
for the unconditional delivery of such payoff letters or other instruments of
discharge or release (it being understood and agreed that the Existing Company
Debt will remain outstanding following the Closing Date with respect to Seller
and certain of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)).

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller (on behalf
of itself and each of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and Seller (on behalf of itself
and each of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
offices, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to commence (and
if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any Action against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any Action relating to the Debt Financing or
the Debt Commitment Letters). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability for any claims, losses, settlements, damages, costs,
expenses, fines or penalties to Seller (or any of its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



44 Section 5.20 Foreign Cash. At and prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
the Companys non-U.S. Subsidiaries not to loan or advance any amounts to the
Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries and any repatriation of funds to the Company
or its U.S. Subsidiaries shall only be accomplished through the repayment of
existing intercompany loans or the payment of dividends by non-U.S.
Subsidiaries of the Company and shall to be done in accordance with all
applicable Laws and agreements. With respect to any Dollars not held in the
U.S. by the Company or a U.S. Subsidiary of the Company, (i.e., one organized
and resident in the United States) as of the Closing (the "Pre-Closing Foreign
Cash"), from and after the Closing and until the date that Buyer delivers the
Adjustment Notice to the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to repatriate any Pre-Closing Foreign Cash to
the United States and will include such cash (to the extent not already
included in the Cash Amount) to the extent actually repatriated by such time
(net of any costs or Taxes related to such repatriation) in the calculation of
the Proposed Cash Amount; _provided_ that the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to repatriate any amounts required to be held by the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company by applicable contract or Law.

Section 5.21 Exclusivity. From and after the date hereof, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (a) initiate,
solicit, facilitate, encourage, discuss, negotiate or accept any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to (i) the acquisition, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, of any of the outstanding
shares of any class or series of equity securities or debt securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any interests therein, (ii) the
acquisition (or any lease, license, long-term supply agreement or other
arrangement having the same economic effect as an acquisition), in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, of a material portion of the
assets and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or interests
therein (on a consolidated basis), (iii) the merger, consolidation or
combination of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) the
recapitalization, restructuring, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each of the foregoing in clauses (i) through (iv),
an "Acquisition Transaction"), or (b) enter into any contract or agreement
concerning or relating to an Acquisition Transaction, in each case with a
party other than Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. In the event that
Seller receives an inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, or obtains
information that such an inquiry, proposal or offer is likely to be made,
Seller shall provide Buyer with immediate notice thereof, which notice shall
include the terms of, and the identity of the person or persons making, such
inquiry, proposal or offer. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
immediately terminate any and all discussions or negotiations with any third
party with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Transaction. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall not transfer,
dispose of or put an Encumbrance on the equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.22 Intercompany Accounts. Prior to the Closing, on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, Seller shall release, cancel,
terminate or otherwise settle all intercompany Indebtedness and accounts owed
by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) as of immediately prior to the

 



45  Closing, and Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to release,
cancel, terminate or otherwise settle all intercompany Indebtedness and
accounts owed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
its Subsidiaries) to the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior
to Closing. The purchase price related calculations in Article II shall be
made after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the prior
sentence. Effective upon the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), hereby forever fully
and irrevocably waives, releases and discharges the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Representatives from any and all claims, liabilities,
obligations or agreements of any kind or nature whatsoever (except obligations
arising following the Closing under the agreements to be entered into pursuant
to this Agreement that are attached as exhibits hereto).

Section 5.23 Transition Matters. From the date hereof until the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
at Buyers request, cooperate and reasonably assist Buyer and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives in connection with transition
preparations and planning related to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including those matters to be transitioned as contemplated by the Transition
Services Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B, and Buyer shall reimburse
Seller at the Closing for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with such cooperation and assistance. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives may identify and engage in
discussions with appropriate candidates to serve in permanent or
interim management positions with the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer may
request in writing that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries hire any such
person and, following receipt of written consent from Seller to such hiring,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Seller shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to hire any such candidates as promptly as
practicable on terms and conditions established by Buyer; provided that if the
Company or a Company Subsidiary hires, commits to hire or otherwise incurs
any obligation with respect to the hiring of any such candidate prior to the
Closing in accordance with Buyers written instructions, (i) if the Closing
occurs, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or the
Company or a Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing in connection with the
hiring and employment of such persons (the "New Executive Costs") shall be
added as a current asset at Closing of the Company for purposes of
determining Closing Date Net Working Capital or (ii) if this Agreement
terminates in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing and the
Termination Fee is not due, Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly following
such termination for such New Executive Costs and any severance payments
(which were consented to by Buyer in writing) paid to such candidates if they
are terminated by the Company within five Business Days of the termination of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 7.01 Survival. The party making a claim under this _Article VII_ is
referred to as the "Indemnified Party" and the party against whom such claims
are asserted under this _Article VII_ is referred to as the "Indemnifying
Party". Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, all
representations and warranties contained herein or in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto and covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement to the extent required to be performed prior to Closing shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date
that is fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date. Each of the covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms contemplate
performance at or after the Closing shall survive the Closing for the period
contemplated by their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the Indemnified Party to
the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration date of the survival period
shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the survival period and
such claims shall survive until finally resolved. The parties hereby agree and
acknowledge that the survival period set forth in this _Section 7.01_ is a
contractual statute of limitations and any claim brought by any party pursuant
to this _Article VII_ must be brought or filed prior to the expiration of the
survival period.

 



48 Section 7.02 Indemnification By Seller. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _Article VII_ , Seller shall indemnify Buyer, its
Affiliates, and any of their respective officers, directors, employees, or
agents (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold
the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses
of, incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
based upon, arising out of, relating to, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement to which Seller is a party;

(b) any breach, non-fulfillment of or failure to observe any covenant,
agreement or obligation to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) (i) any Indemnified Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except to the extent such Indemnified Taxes were included in the calculation
of Final Net Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 2.04_) and (ii) any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing (except to the extent included in the Final Net Working
Capital);

 

(d) any actual fraud committed by Seller, the Company or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or

(e) any Seller Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Liabilities.

 

Section 7.03 Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this _Article VII_ , Buyer shall indemnify Seller, its
Affiliates and any of their respective officers, directors, employees, and
agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and shall
hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all
Losses of, incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnified
Parties based upon, arising out of, relating to, with respect to or by reason
of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
this Agreement to which Buyer is a party;

(b) any breach, non-fulfillment of or failure to observe any covenant,
agreement or obligation to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;
or

(c) any claim by a lessor against Seller under a Lease Guarantee for payment
in accordance with the terms thereto with respect to which a Lease Guarantee
Termination has not occurred prior to the Closing Date.

 



49 Section 7.04 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided in  _Section
7.02_ and _Section 7.03_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.03(a)_ (other than in
respect of the Fundamental Representations) until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.03(a)_ exceeds 1.00% of the Base Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), in which
event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or only be liable
for Losses in excess of the Deductible.

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to  _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_ (other than for a
claim for indemnification under _Section 7.02(d)_ or for breach of a covenant
to be performed at or following the Closing) shall not exceed $21,450,000
(the "Cap"). The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be
liable pursuant to _Section 7.02(d)_ or for which Buyer shall be liable
pursuant to _Section 7.03_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 7.02_ or _7.03_ in
respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to the net amount of
any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such Loss. The Indemnified
Party shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses and (ii) to the extent the Indemnified Party is unable to recover
amounts under clause (i) sufficient to cover any Losses (such amounts, the
"Uncovered Amounts"), upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party,
assign to the Indemnifying Party the right to recover the Uncovered Amounts
under such insurance policies or indemnity, contribution, or other
similar agreements and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Indemnifying Partys claims thereunder.

(d) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 7.02 _or _7.03_
in respect of any Loss shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount
equal to any tax savings from a deduction or loss currently realized in the
year of such Loss as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party (a "Tax
Benefit"). A Tax Benefit shall be considered realized by an Indemnified Party
only to the extent that, but for such Tax Benefit, such Indemnified Partys
Tax liability in the year of the Loss would be higher than it is with such
Tax Benefit and only when such reduction is reflected on a final year-end Tax
Return (e.g., Tax deductions, losses and credits of such Indemnified Party
that do not result from the event giving rise to the indemnity payment shall
be deemed to be used prior to the use of any deduction, loss or credit that
does result from the event giving rise to the indemnity payment).

 

(e) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive damages, except if and to the extent any such damages
are recovered against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim.

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, to
the extent required by Law, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any
Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 



50 (g) The parties agree that for purposes of (i) determining whether there has
been a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ and (ii) calculating the amount
of Losses with respect thereto, such representations and warranties alleged to
have been breached shall be construed as if any qualification or limitation
with respect to materiality, whether by reference to the terms "material," "in
all material respects," "in any material respect" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or words of similar import, were omitted from the text of
such representations and warranties.

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable, describe the Third-Party Claim in specific
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
within 10 Business Days of the notice described in the previous clause, to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. If the Indemnified Party shall
have determined in good faith that (a) an actual or likely conflict of
interest makes representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party by the same counsel inappropriate, (b) that there may be available to
the Indemnified Party one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim or (c) the conduct of
the defense or any proposed settlement of such Third-Party Claim would
reasonably be expected to affect adversely the Indemnified Partys Tax
liability, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, upon notice to
Indemnifying Party, to engage separate counsel and to control the defense
of such Third-Party Claim with respect to such matters, and the reasonable
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section 7.05(b)_, it shall have the right to
take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or
make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party with the Indemnified Partys prior written
consent. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to pay, settle, or
defend such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section
7.05(b)_, pay, settle, or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, including making available (subject to the

 



51  provisions of _Section 5.08_) records relating to such Third-Party Claim
and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-
pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control or consent to the defense
or settlement of (and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party with respect to), and the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to have have control over the defense or settlement of, any
Third-Party Claim that (i) seeks non-monetary relief (except where non-
monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for
monetary damages), (ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii)
involves a claim with a Governmental Authority or a key customer, key supplier
or regulator of the Indemnified Party, (iv) as to which the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination would result in Losses that would
exceed the limitation on the right of the Indemnified Party to recovery
contained in this _Article VII_ or (v) if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party the Indemnifying Party has conflicting or
adverse interests or is also a party and joint representation would be
inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such settlement (i) does not provide for any relief other than the
payment of monetary damages, (ii) provides for the complete and unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, (iii) does not result in a finding or
admission of any violation of Law, breach of contract or similar
acknowledgement, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid
all amounts arising out of such settlement concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense pursuant to _Section 7.05(b)_, it shall not agree to any settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses or is otherwise prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable, describe the
Direct Claim in specific detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate to allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access

 



52  to the Companys and its Subsidiaries premises and personnel and the right
to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying
Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

Section 7.06 Amount of Indemnification. The amount of indemnification to
which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this _Article VII_ shall be
determined: (a) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party; (b) by a final judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction; or (c) by any other means to which the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined.

 

Section 7.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 7.08 Exclusive Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
9.02_, _Section 9.03_ or _Section 10.13_, the parties acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement (other than any claim for actual fraud), shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VII_.
In furtherance of the foregoing, following the Closing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement (other than any right, claim or cause of
action for actual fraud) it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VII_. Nothing in this _Section 7.08_ shall limit
any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to _Section 10.13_.

 

ARTICLE VIII

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyer and Seller for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

Section 8.01 Tax Returns.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare and execute on behalf of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
income Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date whether
filed prior to, on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall determine the
manner in which any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit arising
out of the income,

 



53  properties and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
reported or disclosed in such Tax Returns; _provided, however,_ that all such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with most recent past practice,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. The consolidated
federal and state income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be prepared by Seller on the basis that the Company and its Subsidiaries
taxable year will end at the end of the day on the Closing Date in accordance
with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) and -76(b)(2)(i).
Buyer, at the Sellers expense, shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to furnish Tax information to Seller for use and inclusion in
Sellers consolidated federal and state income Tax Returns for Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall timely pay all Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns. For all taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
extent consistent with past custom and practice, to join in the consolidated
income Tax Returns of Seller and its Affiliates.

(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods
ending after the Closing Date. Buyer shall determine the manner in which any
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit arising out of the income,
properties and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
reported or disclosed on such Tax Returns. Tax Returns relating to a Straddle
Period shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the most recent past practices with respect to such items,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer shall deliver
such Straddle Period income Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the
date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (taking into
account any extensions obtained) with the appropriate taxing authority for
review and approval by Seller which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
all Taxes shown as due and attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date except to the extent such Taxes were included in
Closing Date Net Working Capital. Seller shall deliver any Tax Return of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period (but for consolidated
Seller Tax Returns only to the extent and any portion of or pro forma Tax
return related to the Company and its Subsidiaries) that is filed by the
Company or a Subsidiary after the Closing Date at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (taking
into account any extensions obtained) with the appropriate taxing authority
for review and approval by Buyer which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall consider in good faith such changes as
reasonably requested by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall require Seller, Buyer or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to wait to file a Tax Return until after
it is due under applicable Law (including all available extensions) and any
delay in timely delivery of Tax Returns to the other party shall not void any
indemnification obligations hereunder.

 

(c) _Equity Award Consideration_.

 

(i) Buyer and Seller agree that the payment of the Equity Award Consideration
to the Equity Award holders on or promptly following the Closing Date shall
be allocable to the portion of the Closing Date preceding Buyers acquisition
of the Shares and that such Equity Award Consideration shall be included in
the computation of income for the taxable year of the Company ending on the
Closing Date as described in

 



54  Section 8.01(a). The parties agree that they shall complete Tax Returns and
otherwise report this transaction for Tax purposes consistent with the
foregoing, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.

(ii) In the event that the Equity Award Consideration is required to be
deducted for a Tax year beginning after the Closing, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the U.S. Federal income Tax savings from the
deduction of the Equity Award Consideration realized by Buyer within two (2)
years after the Closing Date. The amount of such income Tax savings referred
to in this clause (ii) shall be determined on a with and without basis by
treating any such deductions attributable to the Equity Award Consideration as
the last items taken into account in any applicable income Tax period and
shall be the positive difference, if any, between the Buyers consolidated
income Tax liability for such period calculated without taking into account
the deductions attributable to the Equity Award Consideration to the Buyers
liability for such period taking into account such deductions. A Tax savings
shall be realized upon the filing of a final period Tax Return reflecting any
reduction in Taxes. Seller, upon the request of Buyer, shall promptly repay
to Buyer any amounts paid pursuant to this clause (ii) (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in
the event that the deductions attributable to the Equity Award Consideration
that gave rise to a payment hereunder are successfully challenged by a
Governmental Authority.

Section 8.02 Controversies.

 

(a) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company and each of its Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date) of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments,
audits or similar events with respect to income Taxes relating to a taxable
period ending prior to or ending on and including the Closing Date for
which Seller may be liable under this Agreement (a "Tax Matter"). Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by Seller or any of its
Affiliates of written notice of any Tax Matter of or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The failure of either party so to notify
the other party shall not limit such partys rights under this _Article VIII_
except to the extent such other party is materially prejudiced by such
failure.

 

(b) As to Tax Matters relating to any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, Seller, or its duly appointed representative (the "Tax Representative")
on behalf of Seller, shall at its expense have the authority to represent the
interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries) with respect to any Tax Matter before the IRS, any other taxing
authority, any other governmental agency or authority or any court and shall
have the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any
Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns
and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, a Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall consult with
Buyer with respect to and shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any Tax Matter that affects or may affect the Tax liability of
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the
foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and Buyer may participate in such Tax Matter at its own expense. Seller or the
Tax

 



55  Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter. In addition, Seller shall,
in good faith, allow Buyer, at its expense, to make comments to Seller or the
Tax Representative, regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such
Tax Matter.

(c) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the authority to
represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries) with respect to any written notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes relating to a Straddle Period. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 8.02_, Buyer shall have the right to control any audit or
examination by any taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund or amend
any Tax Return, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for
additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or
relating to, the income, assets or operations of the Company, and any other
Tax Matter for all taxable periods; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) not to, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Seller or the Tax Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 8.03 Straddle Period. In the case of any Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins
before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of
any such Taxes that constitutes Taxes for any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date and that portion of any Tax period through the end of the
Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (such periods together the "Pre-Closing Period") shall: (a) in
the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to income, payroll, sales or
receipts or any other Tax not described in clause (b) below, be equal to the
amount that would be payable if the tax year or period ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date; and (b) in the case of Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by the level of any item (e.g., real
and personal property taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a
per diem basis. The parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any
Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of business
on the Closing Date, unless such election has an adverse effect on either
party.

 

Section 8.04 Amended Tax Returns. Except as required by applicable Law, Buyer
shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to
file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Return or claims for refund without
the prior written consent of Seller. If consent is granted, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any reasonable cost or Loss that directly results
from such amended Tax Returns or claims for refund.

 



56 Section 8.05 Refunds and Credits. Any refund or credit in lieu of a cash
refund of Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including as a result of
any overpayment of Taxes in prior periods) accruing to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates as a result of the ownership of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is a refund of or credit against Taxes paid in respect of any Pre-
Closing Period shall be for the account of Seller and shall be paid by Buyer
to Seller within five Business Days of actual receipt by Buyer except to the
extent such refund or credit was included in Closing Date Net Working Capital
(as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.04_) or would not have
arisen but for a net operating loss or other Tax asset of the Buyer or its
Affiliates (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing). Buyer agrees to elect to receive in cash
any refund of Taxes (and will not, for the avoidance of doubt, elect to take a
credit against Taxes in future Tax periods) accruing to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Pre-Closing Period. Any other refund or credit
of Taxes shall be for the account of Buyer and shall, to the extent such
refund or credit is received by Seller or any of its Affiliates, be paid by
Seller to Buyer within five Business Days of actual receipt by Seller. Any
refund or credit of Taxes paid by one party to the other party pursuant to
this _Section 8.05_ shall be reduced by such partys out-of-pocket expenses
paid to third-parties in connection with obtaining such refund or credit and
less any Taxes incurred by such party or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the receipt of such refund or credit or any Taxes required to be
withheld.

 

Section 8.06 Post-Closing Access and Cooperation. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller agree to permit the other party to have reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the books and records and personnel
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent relating to a Pre-Closing
Period and are for the purpose of enabling the other party to: (a)
investigate or contest any Tax Matter or (b) evaluate any claim for
indemnification made by the other party. Each of Buyer and Seller may, at its
own cost and expense, make copies of any books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for which reasonable access is afforded under this _Section
8.06_.

Section 8.07 Post-Closing Indemnification of Transactions. Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any additional Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes) owed
by Seller resulting from any transaction engaged in by Company and its
Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing
Date after Buyers purchase of the Shares.

Section 8.08 Post-Closing Transactions not in the Ordinary Course. Buyer and
Seller agree to report all transactions not in the ordinary course of business
occurring on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the Shares on the
Buyers federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). For the sake of clarity and
avoidance of doubt, the payment of compensation by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Closing shall be governed by _Section
8.01(c)_.

Section 8.09 Miscellaneous. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate
all Tax sharing, indemnity and other similar agreements and powers of
attorney with respect to Taxes to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party such that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any obligations thereunder following the Closing. To the extent of any
inconsistency between this _Article VIII_ and _Article VII_ , this _Article
VIII_ shall control as to Tax matters. The covenants and agreements in this
_Article VIII_ shall survive in accordance with their terms. The amount of
any indemnification payment required under _Section 7.02(c) _(and the amount
of Indemnified Taxes), the amount of any reduction under _Section 7.04(d)
_shall each be 

 



57  computed without regard to any net operating loss or other Tax asset of the
Buyer or its Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing). Seller shall make or cause
to be made (and shall refrain from making or causing to be made, as
applicable) Tax elections (including on a protective basis) so that neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall suffer any reduction in tax
basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36.
Buyer will cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax asset, arising in
any Post-Closing Period that could, whether in the absence of an election or
otherwise, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period. If a Tax asset arising in
any Post-Closing Period is required by applicable Law to be carried back to
any Pre-Closing Period, Buyer or its Affiliates shall be entitled to any
refund or other tax savings from any carry back of such Tax asset into any
Pre-Closing Period. The overall foreign loss of the Company and its
Subsidiaries apportioned to the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of
leaving the consolidated group including Seller is currently estimated to be
$0.00, but final computation will be made at the end of Sellers consolidated
Tax year. If Seller is required to apportion an overall foreign loss to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, it agrees to use the method specified in
Treasury Regulations section 1.1501-9(c)(2) that will result in the lowest
amount of overall foreign loss apportioned to the Company and its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this shall not require Seller to
use the fair market methodology. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, harmless from and
against any Taxes of any Person, and any associated Losses, incurred as a
result of the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law as a result of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries having been a member of any consolidated,
combined, unitary or affiliated Tax group prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 9.01 Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Seller if:

 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in _Article VI_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not cured

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.02_
shall not have been fulfilled by October 31, 2015 (the "Drop Dead Date")
unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply
with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that if the
Drop Dead Date occurs during the Marketing

 



58  Period and the parties have otherwise complied with their obligations
hereunder in all material respects, the Drop Dead Date shall automatically
extend to the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the end of the
Marketing Period or, if earlier, the date that the commitments under the Debt
Commitments Letters expire;

(c) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in _Article VI_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not cured
within 21 days after receipt of written notice thereof from Seller;

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section 6.03_

be due to the failure of Seller to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with
by it prior to the Closing; or

(d) by Buyer or Seller by written notice to the other in the event that:

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

(ii) any Governmental Authority has issued or entered a Governmental Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Governmental Order has
become final and non-appealable.

 

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article IX_ , this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no further force or effect and there shall be
no liability on the part of any party hereto or any of their respective Non-
Recourse Parties, except as set forth in this _Section 9.02_.

(a) The provisions of _Section 5.08_, _Section 5.12_,  _Section 5.19(e)_,
this _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_, _Section 10.01_, _Section 10.09_,
_Section 10.12_, and _Section 10.14_ (collectively, the
"Surviving Provisions") and the Confidentiality Agreement, and any other
Section or Article of this Agreement referenced in the Surviving Provisions
which is required to survive in order to give appropriate effect to the
Surviving Provisions, shall in each case survive any termination of this
Agreement.

(b) Seller shall not be released from any Losses resulting from any material
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

(c) Nothing in this _Section 9.02_ shall be deemed to release either party
from any liability for actual fraud.

 



59 Section 9.03 Termination Fee.

 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section
9.01(c)(i)_ or by Buyer or Seller pursuant to  _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 9.01(c)(ii)_ and at the time of such termination, Seller would have
been entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(c)(i)_ (each of (i) and (ii), a "Qualified Termination"), then, in
either case, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount in cash equal to $35,750,000
(the "Termination Fee") as set forth in this _Section 9.03_. Buyer shall pay
the Termination Fee to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, within three (3) Business
Days after the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to a Qualified
Termination.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
shall constitute liquidated damages for a Qualified Termination, and not a
penalty, that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.03_ are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement without the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.03_ and that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_ are supported by due and sufficient consideration.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers right
to receive the Termination Fee if and when due pursuant to this _Section
9.03_ and its rights under _Section 10.13_ prior to the termination of this
Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy (whether in law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Seller or any other Person
against the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Equity Investors, the Debt
Financing Sources, any other potential financing source or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members,
partners, agents, representatives or any of its other Non-Recourse Parties
for all Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or any breach of
any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement, and none of such Persons shall have any other liability or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt
Financing) and Seller shall not seek to recover any other monetary damages or
seek any other remedy based on a claim at law or in equity, whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any Losses suffered as a result
of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer and its Non-Recourse
Parties for Losses under this Agreement shall be limited to the Termination
Fee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller (on behalf of
itself and each of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and Seller (on behalf of itself and each of
its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, offices,
employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to commence (and if
commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any Action against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any Action relating to the Debt Financing or
the Debt Commitment Letters). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability for any Losses to Seller (or any of its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



60 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Buyer fails to consummate
the Closing in breach of its obligations under this Agreement, Seller may, in
its sole discretion: (i) seek specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to _Section 10.13_ prior to termination of this Agreement or (ii)
withdraw or determine not to pursue any claim for specific performance or
other equitable relief, and require payment of the Termination Fee if and when
due pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.03_. While Seller may pursue
both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief under _Section
10.13_ and the payment of the Termination Fee under this _Section 9.03_,
under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance or other equitable relief (excluding
interlocutory relief) and the Termination Fee in connection with this
Agreement or any termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event and under no
circumstances shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer, the Equity Investors, the Debt
Financing Sources, any other potential financing source or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members,
partners, agents, representatives or other Non-Recourse Parties arising out of
this Agreement or relating to a breach, the transactions contemplated hereby
or any agreement entered into in connection herewith or otherwise shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the Termination Fee.

provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original

and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
except that Buyer may assign this Agreement and its rights and interests

Sources in connection with the Debt Financing. No assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may assign or transfer, in whole or in part, to one or more
of its Affiliates its rights to purchase all or a portion of the Shares;
_provided_ that no such assignment or transfer shall relieve the Buyer of its
obligations hereunder.

Section 10.09 No Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in _Section
5.07_, _Article VII_ , this _Section 10.09_ and _Section 10.10_, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective

intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or
equitable right, benefit, remedy, obligation, liability or cause of action of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The Debt Financing
Sources shall be beneficiaries of _Section 5.19(e)_, _Section 9.01(b)_,

Section 10.10 Legal Representation. Buyer, the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates ("Buyer Parties") acknowledge
and agree that Briggs and Morgan, P.A. ("Briggs and Morgan") has acted as
counsel for Seller and Sellers Affiliates ("Seller Parties") for several
years and that Seller Parties reasonably anticipate that Briggs and Morgan
will continue to represent them in future matters. Accordingly, Buyer Parties
expressly: (a) consent to Briggs and Morgans representation of Seller Parties
in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of Buyer Parties on the one
hand, and Seller Parties, on the other hand, are adverse, including, without
limitation, any matter relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto (the "Transaction Matters") and (b) consent to the disclosure by
Briggs and Morgan to Seller Parties in connection with the Transaction Matters
of any information learned by Briggs and Morgan in the course of its
representation of, Seller, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, and their
respective Affiliates prior to Closing, whether or not such information is
subject to attorney-client privilege or Briggs and Morgans duty of
confidentiality. Furthermore, in any post-Closing matter in which the
interests of Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and Seller Parties, on the other
hand, are adverse, Buyer Parties irrevocably waive any right they may have
to 

 



64  discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the
representation of Seller by Briggs and Morgan in connection with the
Transaction Matters, to the extent that such information or documentation was
privileged as to Seller. Buyer Parties further covenant and agree that each
shall not assert any claim against Briggs and Morgan in respect of legal
services provided to Seller, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries,
or their respective Affiliates by Briggs and Morgan in connection with the
Transaction Matters. Upon and after the Closing, the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Briggs
and Morgan, unless and to the extent Briggs and Morgan is specifically
engaged in writing by the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries to represent
the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries after the Closing and either such
engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to Seller Parties or
Seller Parties consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such
representation of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries by Briggs and
Morgan after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. If
and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer Parties shall
have the right to assert or waive an attorney-client privilege with respect to
any communication between the Company or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them relating in any manner to the Transaction Matters, Buyer
Parties shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior written
consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). This section is for the benefit of Seller Parties and Briggs and
Morgan, and Seller Parties and Briggs and Morgan are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this section. This section shall be irrevocable, and no term
of this section may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of Seller and Briggs and Morgan.

waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver
by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any
failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver,
whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or
after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

waive any right to

 



66  trial by jury in respect of any such Action, (v) that a final judgment in

ii TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This Transition Services Agreement, dated as of [●]1 (this "TSA"), is entered
into between Patterson Companies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Seller"),
and Patterson Medical Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Lanai Holdings III, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer") and Seller have
entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of [●] (the
"Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Seller has agreed to sell to Buyer,
and Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller, all the outstanding capital
stock of Company, all as more fully described therein;

 

WHEREAS, in order to ensure an orderly transition of the business of Company
to Buyer, Company and Seller have agreed to enter into this TSA, pursuant to
which Seller will provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, Company and its
Subsidiaries with certain services, in each case on a transitional basis and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants
hereinafter set forth, Company and Seller hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE 1

SERVICES 

Section 1.01 Provision of Services.

 

(a) Seller agrees to provide, or to cause its Affiliates to provide, the
services set forth on the exhibits attached hereto (as such exhibits may be
amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this TSA, collectively, the
"Service Exhibits") and any Additional Services (collectively, the "Services")
to Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Service Recipients") for
the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this
TSA and in the respective Service Exhibits.

 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services.
Accordingly, Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
transition each Service to its own internal organization or to obtain
alternate third-party sources to provide the Services at or prior to the
applicable End Date.

 

(c) Subject to Section 2.03, Section 2.04 and Section 3.05, the obligations of
Seller under this TSA to provide Services shall terminate with respect to
each Service on the end date specified in the applicable Service Exhibit (the
"End Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree
that the Company may determine from time to time that it or another Service
Recipient does not require all of the Services set out on one or more of the
Service Exhibits (including a portion of any particular Service described by a
numbered item on such Service Exhibits) or that it does not require such
Service(s) for the entire period up to the applicable End Date. Accordingly,
Company may terminate any Service (including a portion of any particular
Service described by a numbered item on such Service Exhibits), upon thirty
(30) days advance notification to Seller in writing of any such
determination; _provided_ , that in the event of termination of a Service
(including a portion of any particular Service described by a numbered item
on such Service Exhibits) before the applicable End Date, Company shall
compensate Seller for any incremental out-of-pocket costs Seller actually
incurs as a direct result of terminating a Service before the applicable End
Date, including any non-refundable prepayments made by Seller relating to
such Service, but excluding all costs related to Sellers or its Affiliates
employees (including, but not limited to, wages, bonuses and commissions,
employee benefits, including severance and workers compensation, any
severance plan or bonus plan



   1  | Note to Draft: To be entered into on the Closing Date. _ _ and any change in control, stay, retention or transaction bonuses,
arrangements or agreements and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes
with respect to the foregoing);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not terminate any Service (in whole or in part) that is reasonably
required for the provision of any other Service currently being provided to a
Service Recipient without also terminating such other Service. If the Company
terminates only a portion of a particular Service, then associated price of
such Service shall be reduced on a reasonable basis as determined in good
faith by Seller and the Company. Any election to terminate any Services shall
not relieve Seller of its continuing duty to provide those Services that have
not been terminated. __

(d) This TSA and the performance of the Services under this TSA shall not
constitute a sale, assignment, or transfer of the ownership of any assets or
intellectual property rights of Seller. Company does not receive, by
implication or otherwise, any rights of ownership or license to any property
or intellectual property rights owned, or developed in whole or in part, by
Seller. Company shall not remove or alter any copyright, trademark,
confidentiality, or other proprietary notices that appear on any intellectual
property to which Company gains access during the course of receiving the
Services, and Company shall not attempt to decompile, translate, reverse
engineer, or make copies of any intellectual property of Seller to which
Company receives access during the course of receiving the Services.

Section 1.02 Additional Services. In the event that Company or any of
its Subsidiaries desires to have Seller provide additional services that were
provided by Seller or its Affiliates to Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
the two (2)-year period preceding the Closing Date (other than services
specifically excluded from the Service Exhibits) or that the parties
otherwise mutually agree ("Additional Services"), Seller shall provide such
Additional Services at the price contemplated by Section 2.02(a) or as
otherwise agreed and on such other terms as the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith. The Parties will enter into an amendment to this TSA amending the
Service Exhibits to reflect such Additional Service and such Additional
Service shall be deemed to be part of this TSA and the Services from and
after the date of such amendment.

Section 1.03 Standard of Service.

 

 __(a) Seller represents, warrants and agrees that the Services shall be
performed in a professional and workmanlike manner with the same general
degree of care, skill and diligence as Seller performs such services within
Seller s organization; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Seller
be required to employ higher standards than those employed by Seller
in performing such similar activities for itself, but in no event less than a
reasonable degree of care. Seller agrees to assign sufficient resources and
qualified personnel as are reasonably required to perform the Services and
support Companys and its Subsidiaries transition to its or their internal
organization or to alternate third-party sources in accordance with the
standards set forth in the preceding sentence, which resources and personnel
shall not be of a number or skill level that is less than what has
historically been provided by Seller to the Service Recipients. It is
understood and agreed that the employees of Seller are not professional
providers to third parties of the types of services included in the Services
and that Sellers employees performing the Services may have other
responsibilities and may not be dedicated full-time to performing the
Services; _provided, however_ , that such other responsibilities shall not
excuse Seller from performing its obligations under this TSA. __

(b) Seller represents and warrants that, other than those agreements
that require third-party consent to provide as part of the Services
(including as described in Section 1.05(b)), the execution and delivery by
Seller of, and the consummation by Seller and its Affiliates of the
transactions contemplated by, this TSA, and compliance with the terms hereof
by Seller and its Affiliates, do not and shall not (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, (ii) constitute a
default under, (iii) give any third party the right to modify, terminate or
accelerate any obligation under or (iv) result in a violation of any Law or
agreement to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject.

 

(c) Except as expressly set forth in Section 1.03(a) through Section 1.03(b),
Seller makes no representations or warranties in this TSA of any kind,
implied or expressed, with respect to the Services, including, without
limitation, no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose, which are specifically disclaimed. Company acknowledges and agrees
that this TSA does not create a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint
venture or relationship of trust or agency between the parties and that all
Services are provided by Seller as an independent contractor. Company
acknowledges and agrees that the Services do not include the exercise of
business judgment or general management for Company.

 



2 Section 1.04 Third-Party Service Providers. It is understood and agreed that
Seller has been retaining, and will continue to retain, third-party service
providers to provide Services, and that some of the Services provided to
Company under this TSA will be provided by third-party service providers. In
addition, Seller shall have the right, after obtaining Companys written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed, to hire other third-party subcontractors to provide all or part of
any Service hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall remain
responsible for all of its obligations hereunder and for the acts and
omissions of each third-party service provider and third-party subcontractor
as if they were Sellers own acts and omissions.

Section 1.05 Access to Premises.

 

(a) In order to enable the provision of the Services by Seller, Company agrees
that it shall provide to Sellers and its Affiliates employees and any
third-party service providers or subcontractors who provide Services, at no
cost to Seller, reasonable access to the facilities, assets and books and
records of Company, in all cases to the extent necessary for Seller to
fulfill its obligations under this TSA.

(b) Seller agrees that all of its and its Affiliates employees and any third-
party service providers and subcontractors, when on the property of a Service
Recipient or when given access to any equipment, computer, software, network
or files owned or controlled by a Service Recipient, shall conform to the
policies and procedures of Company concerning health, safety and security
which were applicable during the historical provision of the Services and as
reasonably updated by Company from time to time.

 

Section 1.06 Consents. To the extent the consent, waiver, or approval of any
(sub)contractor, vendor, or other third party is needed in order for Seller
to perform, or for Service Recipients to receive, or to use or provide access
to resources (including, but not limited to, third party software, systems,
products, and services) used to provide, the Services, Company shall: (i)
provide reasonable cooperation to Seller in obtaining such consent, (ii)
comply with any reasonable requirements imposed on Company in connection with
obtaining such consent, and (iii) comply with any reasonable restrictions on
the use of such resources, and Seller shall be responsible for any reasonable
fees payable, royalties or other payments or fees to such (sub)contractor,
vendor, or other third party to the extent necessary to obtain the
consent. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents
and, if, after using such efforts, Seller is unable to obtain any such
consent, the Parties shall work together in good faith to agree upon a
commercially reasonable alternative arrangement. Any costs and expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with the implementation of any such
commercially reasonable alternative arrangement shall be borne by Seller.

 

Section 1.07 BAA. In the event that the parties enter into a Service Exhibit
or amend an existing Service Exhibit pursuant to which Seller may act as a
"Subcontractor" of Company, as that term is defined by the regulations issued
under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
("HIPAA"), the parties will execute the Business Associate Agreement attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

ARTICLE 2

 

COMPENSATION

 

Section 2.01 Responsibility for Wages and Fees. For such time as any employees
of Seller or any of its Affiliates are providing Services to Service
Recipients under this TSA, (a) such employees will remain employees of Seller
or such Affiliate, as applicable, and shall not be deemed to be employees of
any Service Recipient for any purpose, and (b) Seller or such Affiliate, as
applicable, shall be solely responsible for the payment and provision of all
wages, bonuses and commissions, employee benefits, including severance and
workers compensation, and the withholding and payment of applicable
Taxes relating to such employment.

Section 2.02 Terms of Payment and Related Matters.

 

(a) As consideration for provision of the Services, Company shall pay Seller
the amount specified for each Service on such Services respective Service
Exhibit. In addition to such amount, in the event that Seller or any of its
Affiliates incurs reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in the
provision of any Service (with 

 



3  any such expenses in excess of $10,000 individually or $50,000 in the
aggregate approved in advance by Company in writing) (such included expenses,
collectively, "Out-of-Pocket Costs"), excluding, without limitation, license
fees and payments to third-party service providers or subcontractors, and
payments made to employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to
Section 2.01, and Company shall reimburse Seller for all such Out-of-Pocket
Costs in accordance with the invoicing procedures set forth in Section
2.02(b). As to any Additional Services, Company and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith mutually agreeable terms and conditions for the provision of such
Additional Services, _provided_ that Company and Seller agree that the cost of
any Additional Services, (i) to the extent such Additional Services were
provided to the Service Recipients prior to the date hereof, will reflect
what is charged to the Service Recipients in the financial statements
previously made available to Buyer and (ii) to the extent such Additional
Services were not provided to a Service Recipient prior to the date hereof,
will be at a cost mutually agreed upon by Company and Seller, with the cost of
any similar or comparable services provided prior to the date hereof to be
used as a reasonable basis for determining such costs.

 

(b) As more fully provided in the Service Exhibits and subject to the terms
and conditions therein:

 

(i) Seller shall provide Company with monthly invoices ("Invoices"), which
shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as
Company may reasonably request with respect to Out-of-Pocket Costs, amounts
payable under this TSA; and

(ii) Subject to Section 2.05, payments pursuant to this TSA shall be made
within sixty (60) days after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Company from
Seller. Seller reserves the right to charge interest on any amount which has
been due from Company for more than sixty (60) days, at a rate equal to the
lesser of (i) the prime lending rate (as quoted in the Wall Street Journal on
the last business day of the month of such overdue invoice) plus five
percent (5%) per annum; or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

Section 2.03 Extension of Services. The parties agree that Seller shall not
be obligated to perform any Service after the applicable End Date; _provided,
however_ , that this TSA may be extended by the parties hereto upon consent of
both Company (on behalf of the Service Recipients) and Seller (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates).

Section 2.04 Terminated Services. Upon termination or expiration of any or
all Services pursuant to this TSA and subject to Section 2.03, or upon the
termination of this TSA in its entirety, Seller shall have no further
obligation to provide the applicable terminated or expired Services
and Company will have no obligation to pay any future compensation or Out-of-
Pocket Costs relating to such Services (other than for or in respect of
Services already provided in accordance with the terms of this TSA and
received by Company prior to such termination and payment of all amounts
pursuant to Section 1.01(c)).

Section 2.05 Invoice Disputes. In the event of an Invoice dispute, Company
shall deliver a written statement to Seller no later than the date payment is
due on the disputed Invoice listing all disputed items and providing a
reasonably detailed description of each disputed item. Amounts not so
disputed shall be deemed accepted and shall be paid, notwithstanding disputes
on other items, within the period set forth in Section 2.02(b). The parties
shall seek to resolve all such disputes expeditiously and in good
faith. Seller shall continue performing the Services in accordance with this
TSA pending resolution of any dispute.

assessed on Service Recipients as a result of the provision of Services by
Seller pursuant to the TSA.

 

ARTICLE 3

TERMINATION 

Section 3.01 Termination of Agreement. Subject to Section 3.04, this TSA shall
terminate in its entirety (i) on the date upon which Seller shall have no
continuing obligation to perform any Services as a result of each of their
expiration or termination in accordance with Section 1.01(c) or Section 3.02
or (ii) in accordance with Section 3.03.

 



4 Section 3.02 Breach. Any party (the "Non-Breaching Party") may terminate this
TSA with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon
prior written notice to the other party (the "Breaching Party") if the
Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.05) to perform
any of its material obligations under this TSA relating to such Service, and
such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of fifteen (15)
days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure
from the Non-Breaching party seeking to terminate such Service. For the
avoidance of doubt, only non-payment of material amounts that are not the
subject of a good faith dispute by Company for a Service provided by
Seller shall be deemed a material failure to perform by Company for purposes
of this Section 3.02.

Section 3.03 Insolvency. In the event that either party hereto shall (i) file
a petition in bankruptcy, (ii) become or be declared insolvent, or become the
subject of any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to
its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (iii) make an
assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of its creditors, or (iv)
take any corporate action for its winding up or dissolution, then the other
party shall have the right to terminate this TSA by providing written notice
in accordance with Section 6.01.

Section 3.04 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this TSA in its
entirety pursuant to Section 3.01, all obligations of the parties hereto shall
terminate, except for the provisions of Section 1.01(c), Section
2.04, Section 2.06, ARTICLE 4, ARTICLE 5 and ARTICLE 6, which shall survive
any termination or expiration of this TSA. Notwithstanding anything in this
TSA to the contrary, neither Seller nor Company shall be released from any
Losses resulting from any breach of this TSA prior to such termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following any termination of this TSA, Seller
shall cooperate in good faith with Company to transfer to Company or its
designee, in connection with Companys making of alternative arrangements for
the provision of services substantially consistent with the Services, all
applicable records, computer hardware and software, procedures, methods,
systems, strategies, tools, equipment, facilities, databases, data, networks,
systems, contracts and other resources used by Seller, any of its Affiliates,
or any third-party service provider and, to the extent such cooperation is not
already contemplated by the Service Exhibits, Company shall pay Seller
reasonable compensation for such cooperation.

Section 3.05 Force Majeure. The obligations of Seller under this TSA with
respect to any Service shall be suspended during the period and to the extent
that Seller is prevented or hindered from providing such Service, or Company
is prevented or hindered from receiving such Service, due to any of
the following causes beyond such partys reasonable control (such causes,
"Force Majeure Events"): (i) acts of God, (ii) flood, fire or explosion, (iii)
war, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, (iv) Governmental Order or Law,
(v) actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this
TSA, (vi) action by any Governmental Authority, (vii) national or regional
emergency, (viii) shortage of adequate power or transportation facilities, or
(ix) any other event which is beyond the reasonable control of such party. The
party suffering a Force Majeure Event shall give notice of suspension as soon
as reasonably practicable to the other party stating the date and extent of
such suspension and the cause thereof, and Seller shall resume the performance
of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the
cause. Neither Company nor Seller shall be liable for the nonperformance or
delay in performance of its respective obligations under this TSA when such
failure is due to a Force Majeure Event; _provided, however,_ that even if the
Force Majeure Event affects Company, Company is still required to make timely
payment to Seller for Services rendered hereunder.

CONFIDENTIALITY

 

Section 4.01 Confidentiality.

 

(a) During the term of this TSA and thereafter, the parties hereto shall, and

service provider or subcontractor providing Services on Sellers behalf to,
maintain in confidence and not disclose the other partys

specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however
recorded or preserved, whether written or oral (any such information,
"Confidential Information"). Each party hereto shall use the same degree of
care,  

 



5  but no less than reasonable care, to protect the other partys Confidential
Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like
nature. Unless otherwise authorized in any other agreement between the
parties, any party receiving any Confidential Information of the other party
(the "Receiving Party") may use Confidential Information only for the purposes
of fulfilling its obligations under this TSA (the "Permitted Purpose"). Any
Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information only to its
Representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted
Purpose and who have been advised of the terms of this Section 4.01 and the
Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of these confidentiality
provisions by such Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Receiving Party
may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential
Information is required to be disclosed by a Governmental Order, in which case
the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the
disclosing party (the "Disclosing Party"), and take reasonable steps to
assist in contesting such Governmental Order or in protecting the Disclosing
Partys rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party
shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its
counsel in writing that it is legally bound to disclose under such
Governmental Order.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not
include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (i) was
publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known
through no act of the Receiving Party or its Representatives in breach of this
Section 4.01; (ii) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty
of confidentiality; or (iii) was developed by it independently without any
reliance on the Confidential Information.

 

(c) Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or
termination of this TSA with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party
agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Partys option, all
Confidential Information. If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an
authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction
in writing.

of the Unsecured PHI or other sensitive data (such as Social Security or
account numbers) involved in the Breach, and any other information required
to be disclosed under 45 CFR § 164.410.

2\. Companys Notice of Breach. Company will be responsible for providing
notice of the Breach to Company Customer(s) as required by the HIPAA Breach
Notification Rule.

F. Obligations of Company Regarding PHI. To the extent that it may impact
Business Associate Service Providers use or disclosure of PHI, Company agrees
to inform Business Associate Service Provider in writing of: any limitation in
Companys Customer(s) Notice of Privacy Practices; any changes to

restriction to a use or disclosure agreed to by Companys Customer(s) with
respect to a patients PHI; and any opt-out by a patient from marketing or
fundraising activities by Companys Customer(s). Company will not ask
Business Associate Service Provider to use or disclose PHI in any manner that
would not be permitted under HIPAA if done by Company or Companys
Customer(s). Company will disclose PHI to Business Associate Service Provider
in accordance with HIPAA and will be responsible for using appropriate
safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, privacy and security of PHI
transmitted or disclosed to Business Associate Service Provider.

G. Term and Termination.

1\. Term. This BA Agreement shall continue in effect until the Service
Agreement terminates, or Business Associate Service Provider no longer
provides Services to Company, or this BA Agreement terminates pursuant to
Section G.2.

 

2\. Termination. If either party knows of a pattern of activity or practice of
the other party that constitutes a material breach or violation of this BA
Agreement, then the non-breaching party shall provide written notice of the
breach or violation to the other party that specifies the nature of the breach
or violation. The breaching party must cure the breach or end the violation on
or before thirty (30) days after receipt of the written notice. In the
absence of a cure reasonably satisfactory to the non-breaching party, then the
non-breaching party may do the following:

 

(a) if feasible, terminate this BA Agreement and the provision of Services by
Business Associate Service Provider to Company; or

 



A-5 (b) if termination of this BA Agreement or the provision of Services is not
feasible, report the problem to HHS. 

3\. Effect of Termination or Expiration. Within thirty (30) days after the
termination or expiration of this BA Agreement, Business Associate Service
Provider shall return or destroy all PHI, if feasible to do so, including all
PHI in possession of Business Associate Service Providers Subcontractors. If
return or destruction of the PHI is not feasible, Business Associate
Service Provider shall notify Company in writing of the reasons return or
destruction is not feasible and Business Associate Service Provider shall
extend any and all protections, limitations and restrictions contained in this
BA Agreement to Business Associate Service Providers use and/or disclosure
of any PHI retained after the termination or expiration of this BA Agreement,
and to limit any further uses and/or disclosures solely to the purposes that
make return or destruction of the PHI not feasible.

H. Miscellaneous.

1\. Statutory and Regulatory References. Each reference in this BA Agreement
to any provision of HIPAA means such provision(s) as amended from time to
time.

2. Amendment of BA Agreement. This BA Agreement may be amended only in a
writing agreed to by both Company and Business Associate Service Provider. If
it becomes necessary to amend this BA Agreement in order to comply with
applicable provisions of HIPAA, the parties will negotiate in good faith to
amend the BA Agreement in a manner that complies with applicable provisions of
HIPAA.

3. Interpretation. This BA Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
applicable provisions of HIPAA and HHS guidance interpreting same. Any
ambiguity in this BA Agreement shall be resolved to permit the parties to
comply with applicable provisions of HIPAA. The provisions of this BA
Agreement will prevail over any contrary or inconsistent provision in the
Service Agreement or related documents with respect to PHI. All other terms of
the Service Agreement or related documents remain in force and effect.

4\. No Third Party Beneficiaries/Assignment. Nothing in this BA Agreement
confers on any person other than Company and Business Associate Service
Provider (and their respective successors and assigns) any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities whatsoever. There are no third party beneficiaries
to this BA Agreement. Company may assign its rights and responsibilities with
respect to information covered under this BA Agreement to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

5\. Governing Law Except as preempted by HIPAA or other federal law, this BA
Agreement will be governed by the laws of Minnesota.

6\. State Privacy Laws. Company and Business Associate Service Provider
acknowledge that each is obligated to comply with all applicable state privacy
laws and regulations.

 



A-6 7\. Insurance. If Company requires, Business Associate Service Provider shall
obtain and maintain insurance coverage against the improper use or any
disclosure of PHI by Business Associate Service Provider, naming Company as an
additional named insured. Promptly following a request by Company for the
maintenance of such insurance coverage, Business Associate Service Provider
shall provide a certificate evidencing such coverage.

8\. Indemnification. Notwithstanding any limitation on damages or liability
or any indemnification obligations contained in the Service Agreement,

shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors
("Indemnified Party") harmless from and against any and all actual losses,
liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) arising out of or related to a breach of this BA Agreement,
any unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI, Security Incident, as described
above, or Breach of Unsecured PHI, or violation of HIPAA that is caused by the
acts or omissions of Business Associate Service Provider or any of its
employees, officers, directors, agents, or its own subcontractors. The
obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party shall survive the expiration or
termination of this BA Agreement for any reason.

 

9\. Nature of Agreement. Nothing in this BA Agreement shall be construed to
create a partnership, joint venture, or other joint business
relationship between the parties or any of their affiliates, or a
relationship of employer and employee between the parties. Rather, it is the
intention of the parties that their relationship shall be that of independent
contractors.

LICENSE

(a) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this TTLA, Licensor,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to Licensee the non-
exclusive, right and license to use the Licensed Marks solely (i) in
connection with the Licensed Fields of Use in the Territory during the Term,
(ii) in a manner materially in conformity with the practices of the Business
prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) in a manner that does not harm or
disparage Licensor, Owner or their respective Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of the Licensed Marks (the "License").

(b) Licensor, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to
Licensee the exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Licensed Domain Names
in connection with the Licensed Fields of Use in the Territory during the Term
as URLs in connection with the continued operation of the Internet and
Intranet websites operated under those URLs prior to the Closing Date.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, no use by or through Licensee of the Licensed
Marks, or any component thereof, on or in connection with physical,
electronic, magnetic or other materials (including without limitation
products) in existence on or prior to the Closing Date shall constitute a
breach of this TTLA.

 



3 (d) Except as set forth in this _Section 2.01(d)_, Licensee shall permanently
cease, and shall cause all sublicensees to permanently cease, all use of the
Licensed Marks no later than the End-of-Use Date, and Licensee and its
sublicensees shall make no use of the Licensed Marks thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this TTLA, after
the End-of-Use Date, Licensee may (i) retain and use, for Licensees internal
business purposes, records, and other historical or archived documents
containing or referencing the Licensed Marks and (ii) use the Licensed Marks
to the extent required by or permitted as a fair use or otherwise under
applicable Law. For a period of eighteen (18) months following the End-of-Use
Date (the "Co-branding Period"), Licensee may use the Licensed Marks to refer
on its websites and in its advertising, marketing, and promotional materials
to the historical fact that Licensee previously conducted the Business under
the Licensed Marks. Licensee agrees that, during the Co-branding Period,
Licensees use of the Licensed Marks, except to the extent otherwise permitted
by this _Section 2.01(d)_, shall be limited to use for effecting customer
transition to Licensees new brand names (including relevant trademarks, trade
names, and domain names).

(e) Notwithstanding and without limiting any other provision of this TTLA,
Licensee is not permitted to make new uses of any mark containing the term
"PATTERSON" without the written consent of Licensor.

 

(f) Notwithstanding and without limiting any other provisions of this TTLA, no
use by or through Licensee of the Licensed Marks, or any component thereof,
in a manner materially in conformity with the practices of the Business prior
to the Closing Date shall constitute a material breach of this TTLA.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this TTLA, Licensee is not
permitted to use the Licensed Marks in connection with any Excluded Fields of
Use. To the extent a use of the Licensed Marks could reasonably be considered
to fall within both a Licensed Field of Use and an Excluded Field of Use, such
use shall be considered to fall within the Licensed Field of Use, and such use
by Licensee shall not be considered a breach of this TTLA.

ARTICLE 3

 

FEES

Section 3.01  _Royalty Free_. The License is fully paid-up and accordingly no
further royalty, license fee or other consideration is to be paid by Licensee
during the Term in consideration for the grant of the License by Licensor.

ARTICLE 4

 

TERM

Section 4.01  _Term and End-of-Use Date Reporting and Requirements_.

 

(a) The "Term" of this TTLA shall begin on the Closing Date and shall continue
for a period of eighteen (18) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance
with the provisions of _Article 5_ below. Licensee will use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure any known legal, governmental and regulatory
approval requirements needed to cease all use of the Licensed Marks by the
end of the Term.

 



4 (b) If at the End-of-Use Date, Licensee possesses product inventory that
existed as of the Closing Date and that uses the Licensed Marks, Licensor
hereby covenants not to sue Licensee for selling such product inventory after
the End-of-Use Date.

 

(c) Licensee shall provide Licensor with a written summary report at the End-
of-Use Date, which (i) confirms that all use of the Licensed Marks has ceased,
and (ii) lists all of Licensees active domain name registrations and trade
name registrations, if any, containing or comprising any of the Licensed
Marks. After the End-of-Use Date, Licensor shall have the right to require
Licensee to transfer said domain name or trade name registrations to Licensor
or Owner, at Licensors sole cost and expense. Licensor thereafter may
maintain any such transferred domain names or trade names at its sole and
absolute discretion, cost and expense.

ARTICLE 5

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 5.01 _Termination For Material Breach_.

 

(a) Licensor may terminate this TTLA in the event Licensee materially breaches
this TTLA and fails to reasonably cure said Material Breach within thirty
(30) days of receiving written notice from Licensor under _Section 11.12_,
setting forth a reasonable description of the asserted Material Breach. Only
the following acts shall constitute a material breach ("Material Breach") of
this TTLA by Licensee:

(i) Any use by Licensee or its sublicensees of the Licensed Marks in any
Field of Use other than the Licensed Fields of Use;

(ii) Any material failure by Licensee or its sublicensees to comply with the
obligations under Article 8 (Quality Control);

(iii) Any material failure by Licensee or its sublicensees to comply with
_Section 7.01_;

(iv) Any assignment by Licensee in violation of  _Section 6.01_.

(b) If and when a Material Action takes place with respect to Licensor,
Licensee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this TTLA by
providing written notice to Licensor of its intent to terminate.

(c) The Parties agree that the mutual covenants and considerations of this
TTLA shall not prejudice the Parties respective rights to recover damages for
any Material Breach of this TTLA.

 

Section 5.02 _No Termination for Non-Material Breach_. One of the objectives
of the License is to, without undue expense or loss of revenue to Licensee,
cease the use by Licensee of the Licensed Marks in the Licensed Fields of Use
at the end of the Term. Without limiting the Parties rights hereunder, only
the events identified in _Section 5.01_ shall be grounds for Licensor to
terminate this TTLA prior to the end of the Term. For all other breaches of
this TTLA by

 



5  Licensee (each, a "Non-Material Breach"), Licensee must make commercially
reasonable efforts to correct such Non-Material Breach within thirty (30) days
of receiving written notice from Licensor under _Section 11.12_, setting
forth a reasonable description of the asserted Non-Material Breach.

Section 5.03 _Effect of Expiration or Termination_. Upon expiration or
termination of this TTLA and the rights granted hereby, subject to _Sections
2.01(d)_ and _4.01(b)_ , Licensee shall end all use of the Licensed Marks by
the End-of-Use Date. Until the End-of-Use Date, Licensee shall comply with
all provisions of this TTLA, including, but not limited to, its obligations
under _Article 8_ hereof. After the End-of-Use Date, except as set forth in

in particular, Licensee shall not be entitled to receive from Licensor any
kind of compensation, redundancy fee or any other payment related to any
goodwill which might have resulted from the implementation of this TTLA.

ASSIGNMENT; SUBLICENSING

 

Section 6.01 _License Personal to Licensee_. This TTLA remains personal to
Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred by Licensee without
Licensors prior written consent, which shall be in Licensors sole and
absolute discretion. For purposes of this _Section 6.01_, an assignment shall
include a Change of Control, merger, reorganization (in bankruptcy or
otherwise), assumption in bankruptcy or equity and asset sale, regardless of
whether such transaction is considered an "assignment" under governing law and
in the event of an assignment by operation of this sentence Licensors
consent to such assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (but in no event shall Licensor be required to consent to an
assignment to a competitor of Licensor).

 

Section 6.02 _Sublicensing_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.02(b)_, Licensee may grant a sublicense of its
rights under this TTLA to use the Licensed Marks for the Licensed Fields of
Use to a current Affiliate of Licensee in connection with the furtherance of
Licensees or such Affiliates operations.

 

(b) In the event that Licensee grants a sublicense permitted under _Section
6.02(a)_, such sublicense shall be in writing and require the sublicensee to
comply with all terms of this TTLA, including, but not limited to, _Article 4_
(Term), _Article 5_ (Termination), and _Article 8_

 



6  (Quality Control). Licensee shall be liable, and hereby expressly accepts
liability, for any breach of this TTLA by sublicensees to whom it granted a
sublicense after the Closing Date and any breach of such sublicense
agreement. All such sublicenses shall automatically terminate (i) upon
expiration or termination of this TTLA, or (ii) in the event any sublicensee
is no longer an Affiliate of Licensee.

 

(c) During the Term, Licensee is permitted to grant sublicenses to (i) third
party distributors or resellers in connection with such distributors or
resellers sale of products referring to Licensed Marks, in each case in a
manner materially in conformity with the practices of the Business prior to
the Closing Date or (ii) with respect only to products to be marketed and
sold by Licensee or an authorized Affiliate, to third party manufacturers
solely for the purpose of their manufacture of such products using Licensed
Marks on behalf of Licensee or its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.03 _Acknowledgement_. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that (a) this
TTLA is in the nature of a personal service arrangement, (b) under applicable
trademark law, Licensor would be excused from accepting performance from or
rendering service to an assignee of the contract, and (c) any restrictions on
assignment under this TTLA are valid and enforceable under Bankruptcy Code
Section 365(c)(1).

Section 6.04 _Conduct Rendering License Void_. Any purported assignment,
sublicense or other transaction in violation of this _Article 6_ shall be null
and void ab initio and of no force and effect. In the event of a permitted
assignment, this TTLA shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and its respective permitted successors and assigns.

ARTICLE 7

 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

 

Section 7.01 _Ownership_. Owner and its Affiliates are, and the Parties agree
and acknowledge that Owner and its Affiliates are, the sole and exclusive
owner of all right, title and interest in the Licensed Marks and all the
goodwill associated therewith. Licensor and its Affiliates have the right to
enter this TTLA and grant the license herein. Nothing in this TTLA shall be
construed as granting to Licensee any rights, title or interests in or to the
Licensed Marks, other than the rights granted hereby to use the Licensed Marks
in accordance with this TTLA. Licensee shall not apply to register the
Licensed Marks or any trade names, domain names, trademarks or service marks
that contain the Licensed Marks or are confusingly similar to or dilutive of
the Licensed Marks. After the expiration or termination of this TTLA, except
as set forth in  _Sections_ _2.01(d)_ and _4.01(b)_ , Licensee shall not use,
register, apply to register or cooperate in any use, application to register
or registration of the Licensed Marks or any trade names, trademarks or
service marks that contain the Licensed Marks or are confusingly similar to
or dilutive of the Licensed Marks. Licensee shall not, during the Term or
thereafter, attack Owners title to or in the Licensed Marks, the validity of
the Licensed Marks, or any registration thereof, or oppose any effort by
Owner to register any of the Licensed Marks or any confusingly similar
variations or formatives thereof anywhere in the world.

 

Section 7.02 _Maintenance and Procurement of Trademark Registrations_. Owner
shall be responsible, in its sole and absolute discretion, for all
procurement and maintenance of the Licensed Marks. Owner shall renew all
Licensed Marks in the Licensed Fields of Use in its

 



7  sole and absolute discretion. In the event that Owner elects not to renew
any Licensed Mark in the Licensed Fields of Use, Licensor will provide
Licensee no less than sixty (60) days written notice of its intention not to
renew, and the cost of renewal, and Licensee shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to instruct Owner to renew, and Owner shall renew at Licensees
expense. Owner shall be the sole and exclusive party entitled to procure
and/or register the Licensed Marks.

Section 7.03 _Enforcement_.

 

(a) Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor in writing of any infringement of
the Licensed Marks that comes to its attention at any time during the Term,
which notice shall also state whether such infringement is regarded by
Licensee as material.

(b) Owner shall, in its sole and absolute discretion and at its sole expense,
have the exclusive right to sue in its own name for any infringement of the
Licensed Marks or take any other enforcement action it deems necessary or
appropriate under the circumstances.

 

Section 7.04 _Maintenance of Domain Names and Trade Names; Re-direct_. During
the Term, Licensee shall be responsible, at Licensees sole cost and expense,
for management and maintenance of all trade names and domain names that
contain or comprise the Licensed Marks, on behalf of and for the benefit of
Licensor, which are listed on Schedule D hereto (which shall promptly be
amended by written agreement of the Parties upon actual notice of any
additional trade names or domain names that contain or comprise the Licensed
Marks). In the event that Licensee decides not to renew a domain name or
trade name listed on Schedule D, it shall notify Licensor in writing no later
than ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the registration for said domain
name or trade name. Licensor shall have the right to require Licensee to
transfer said domain name or trade name registration to Licensor or Owner, at
Licensors sole cost and expense. Licensor or Owner thereafter shall maintain
any such transferred domain names or trade names at its sole and
absolute discretion, cost and expense. Licensee shall not procure any new
domain names containing the Licensed Marks. For a period of two (2) years
after the expiration or termination of this TTLA, Licensor shall re-direct
all Licensed Domain Name traffic to Licensees new domain names, as reasonably
instructed by Licensee.

 

ARTICLE 8

QUALITY CONTROL

Section 8.01 _Valuable Marks_. Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Marks
are extremely valuable and must continue to be associated only with high-
quality goods and services in order to maintain their value. Licensor
acknowledges that the use of the Licensed Marks in the Business during the
twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date has complied with this _Section
8.01_ and the first sentence of _Section 8.02_.

 

Section 8.02 _Product Quality_. Licensee shall only use the Licensed Marks in
connection with high-quality goods that comply with all applicable laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which such goods are manufactured, sold or
distributed. To comply with the quality standards of this TTLA, any products
manufactured, sold or distributed by Licensee

 



8  under the Licensed Marks must be of substantially the same quality as
relevant products sold by the Business as of the Closing Date. Licensee agrees
to cooperate and comply with all quality control measures reasonably
requested by Licensor consistent with the terms of this TTLA, including, but
not limited to, the right of Licensor to inspect plants, facilities, goods or
other products bearing or associated with the Licensed Marks to monitor
product quality. Any such inspections shall be conducted by Licensor during
normal business hours in a manner that minimizes business disruption and at
Licensors expense.

 

Section 8.03 _Suspension_. Without prejudice to Licensors right to terminate
this TTLA pursuant to _Article 5_ , Licensor shall have the right to suspend
Licensees use of the Licensed Marks in relation to any product not complying
with _Section 8.02_ above until such time as Licensee has cured such non-
compliance. In the event Licensor suspends Licensees rights to use the
Licensed Marks in relation to any such product, Licensor will evaluate all
submissions evidencing correction of the identified quality control failure
within a commercially reasonable period, not to exceed ten (10) Business Days
from the receipt by Licensor of such submissions from Licensee. Failure to
provide written notice during such ten (10) Business Day period of Licensors
rejection of such evidence of correction, specifying in detail the grounds of
the rejection, shall be deemed acceptance of the cure and shall automatically
cure any breach and lift the suspension effective as of the eleventh (11th)
Business Day from the receipt by Licensor of such submissions from Licensee.

Section 8.04 _Use of Licensed Marks_. Licensee shall use the Licensed Marks
in accordance with appropriate standards and good practice for trademark use.
Each use by the Business on or in the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing
Date shall be deemed to meet the appropriate standards of this _Article 8_.
Upon Licensors reasonable request, Licensee will submit samples of its
Marketing Materials bearing the Licensed Marks and/or goods manufactured, sold
or distributed under the Licensed Marks to Licensor, at Licensors expense.

Section 8.05 _Social Media_. Except as used by the Business in the
twelve (12) months immediately before the Closing Date, and subject to
_Article 2_ hereof, Licensee and its sublicensees shall not use the Licensed
Marks in any social media channels, including, but not limited to, Facebook,
LinkedIn, YouTube, and Twitter.

ARTICLE 9

itself and its Affiliates, sublicensees, employees, agents, customers,
successors and assigns, to indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its
Affiliates, successors, legal representatives, assigns and licensees, and
their respective officers, agents and employees, from and against all claims,

any damage, injury or other casualty arising from material breaches of this
TTLA by the breaching Party.

Bests rating of A- or above commercial general liability insurance in the

broad form property damage liability coverage. This insurance shall include
broad form blanket contractual liability, personal injury liability, bodily
injury liability, advertising liability, products and completed operations
liability coverage. With the exception of products and completed operations
liability coverage, which shall be written on a "claims made" form, each
coverage shall be written on an "occurrence" form.

 

ARTICLE 11

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 11.01 _No Relationship Created_. Nothing contained in this TTLA shall
be deemed or construed to create any partnership or joint venture between
Licensor and Licensee, nor shall the execution, completion and implementation
of this TTLA confer on either Party any power to bind or impose any
obligations on the other Party or any third parties or to pledge the credit
of the other Party.

Section 11.02 _Successors and Assigns_. This TTLA shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither Party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party,
except that Licensee may assign this TTLA and its rights and interests herein
without any such consent as collateral to its or its Affiliates applicable
Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

Section 11.03 _Recordal of Licenses_. Licensee shall be entitled to record (a)
a "short form" of this TTLA or a form of this TTLA redacting confidential
Information (for clarity, all information listed on the Schedules hereto shall
be considered confidential Information and, unless otherwise agreed, shall not
be filed in connection with such short form or redacted agreement, except as
redacted to list only the relevant Licensed Marks listed on Schedule A as
necessary for each recordal), but not this TTLA in its entirety, in those
jurisdictions requiring such a recordal, and/or (b) enter Licensee as a
registered or authorized user of the Licensed Marks in those jurisdictions
requiring such a recordal. Licensee shall bear all costs related to such a
recordal, and Licensor shall provide commercially reasonable support necessary
to effect such recordal of this TTLA.

Section 11.04 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This TTLA shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those
of the State of Delaware. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or based upon this TTLA or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
instituted in the federal courts of the United States of America or the
courts of the state of Delaware in each case located in the city of Wilmington
and county of New Castle, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive

 



10  jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service
of process, summons, notice or other document by mail to such Partys address
set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action
or other proceeding brought in any such court. The Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or any proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waive and agree not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

Section 11.05 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this TTLA were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. Accordingly, in the event
of a breach or threatened breach of this TTLA by a Party, it is hereby agreed
that the other Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction (without posting a bond or
other security or proving the inadequacy of money damages), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled
at law or in equity.

 

Section 11.06 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of
any legal action arising out of or relating to this TTLA or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Party to this TTLA certifies and acknowledges that
(a) no representative of the other Party has represented, expressly
or otherwise, that such other Party would not seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such Party has considered the
implications of this waiver, (c) such Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and
(d) such Party has been induced to enter into this TTLA by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 11.06_.

 

Section 11.07 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this TTLA is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this TTLA or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this TTLA so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

Section 11.08 _Force Majeure Events_. Neither Party (nor any Person acting on
its behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for failure to fulfill
any obligation (other than a payment obligation) under this TTLA, so long as
and to the extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of a Force
Majeure Event. The Party claiming the benefit of this provision shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of any such event (a) notify
the other Party of the nature and extent of any such Force Majeure Event, and
(b) use due diligence to remove any such causes and resume performance under
this TTLA as soon as feasible.

 

Section 11.09 _Amendment and Modification; Waiver_. This TTLA may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
Party hereto. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth

 



11  in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No failure to exercise, or
delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this
TTLA shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 11.10 _Interpretation_. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this TTLA shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this TTLA.

 

Section 11.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This TTLA is for the sole
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this TTLA.

RECITALS

A. Assignor/Licensor is willing to assign to Assignee/Licensee its rights in
certain domain names as specified in _Schedule 1_ attached hereto (the
"Assigned Domain Names"), to provide a transitional license to use
certain domain names as specified in the Transitional Trademark License
Agreement _Schedule D_ (the "Transitional Domain Names") and provide a license
for Assignee/Licensee to use the intellectual property in certain
websites associated with the Assigned Domain Names and the Transitional

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Assignor/Licensor and
Assignee/Licensee, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Assignment and Transitional License_. Assignor/Licensor does hereby
irrevocably grant, sell, convey, transfer, assign, deliver and relinquish
exclusively to Assignee/Licensee all of its worldwide right, title, and
interest in and to all of the Assigned Domain Names. By operation of

Assignee/Licensee a license for the Term of that agreement to use the
Transitional Domain Names. Assignor/Licensor retains all intellectual property
related to and used in connection with the Associated Websites related to the
Assigned Domain Names and the Transitional Domain Names, including but not
limited to the following: rights to the proprietary code upon which the
websites rely, rights in presentation layers, copyrights to webpages designed
for the websites, page layouts for the websites, all graphics used in the
websites, all databases generated by the websites, online forms and search
engine created and currently used for the websites, and all
banner advertisements for the websites ("Website Intellectual Property").

2\. _License Grant_. Assignor/Licensor does hereby grant to Assignee/Licensee
a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to the Website Intellectual Property related to the Assigned Domain Names and
the Transitional Domain Names, including rights to download, install, use,
copy, modify and make derivative works of the same. This license is personal
to Assignee/Licensee and may not be sublicensed, transferred, assigned or sold
to any other person or entity, except to the surviving entity of any merger
or consolidation or to any purchaser of substantially all of
Assignee/Licensees assets. Assignor/Licensor retains the rights to terminate
the license granted herein if Assignee/Licensee  breaches the provisions of this paragraph. The terms of the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement between the parties apply to the
Assignee/Licensees use of any trademarks owned by Assignor/Licensor,
including the use of such trademarks in connection with the Associated
Websites, and nothing in this Domain Name Assignment and License Agreement
shall limit, derogate, or otherwise affect any rights granted to
Assignee/Licensee in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement with
respect to the use of such trademarks or the Transitional Domain Names.

3.  _Execution and Delivery_. Assignor/Licensor agrees that it will take such
actions and execute such documents (including, without limitation, the prompt
execution and delivery of documents in recordable form or testifying as to any
material fact or thing and including the transfer of any domain names through
appropriate communications with domain name registrars) as may be necessary to
vest in and secure unto Assignee/Licensee the full right, title and interest
in and to the Assigned Domain Names. Within five (5) business days after
Closing, Assignor/Licensor shall deliver to Assignee/Licensee a copy of all
code and proprietary materials necessary for Assignee/Licensee to exercise its
rights hereunder or otherwise use or operate the Associated Websites.

4\. _Power of Attorney to Effect Domain Name Assignments_. In the event
Assignee/Licensee is unable after reasonable effort to secure signature on
behalf of Assignor/Licensor on any document needed for the actions specified
to assign the Assigned Domain Names under this Domain Name Assignment and
License Agreement, Assignor/Licensor does hereby make, constitute and appoint
Assignee/Licensee (and any officer or agent of Assignee/Licensee as
Assignee/Licensee may select in its sole discretion) as Assignor/Licensors
true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with the power to
endorse Assignor/Licensors name on all applications, documents, papers and
instruments necessary only to implement and effect the assignment of Assigned
Domain Names under this Domain Name Assignment and License Agreement
including, but not limited to, the filing of any instrument of assignment and
documents related thereto to effect such assignment with any domain name
registrar.

5.  _Operation and Maintenance_. Assignee/Licensee will be solely responsible
for maintaining and operating the Assigned Domain Names and Associated
Websites as of the Effective Date, including all costs associated therewith,
except as otherwise set forth in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement
or unless maintenance and operation of any Associated Website is expressly
made part of the Transition Services Agreement between the Parties, in which
case the terms of the Transition Services Agreement will apply with respect
to such Associated Website(s).

6\. _Governing Law_. This Domain Name Assignment and License Agreement will
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware and any suit or action hereunder will be brought in said
jurisdiction.

 

7\. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
