Agreement

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. Description of Transaction

1.1 Sale and Purchase. At the Closing (as defined in Section 1.4(a)), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall purchase and acquire from each of the Sellers, the number and class of
equity securities of the Company and Blocker, as applicable, set forth
opposite such Seller's name in the column titled "Number and Class of Units
(or Blocker Units) Owned as of Immediately Prior to the Closing" (the
"Purchased Securities"), free and clear from all Encumbrances and with the
benefit of all rights of whatsoever nature attaching or accruing to such
Purchased Securities, in consideration for the payments described in Section
1.2.

1.2 Purchase Price.

(a) Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and subject to Sections 1.2(b) and 1.6, the aggregate
consideration payable by Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) for the
Purchased Securities (the "Purchase Price") shall be: (i) the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price payable to the Sellers pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(i);
(ii) any payments to be made pursuant to Section 1.3(e)(ii); (iii) any
distributions to be made to the Sellers from the Escrow Funds pursuant to
Section 11.7 and the Escrow Agreement; and (iv) any distributions to be made
to the Sellers from the Sellers' Representative Fund pursuant to Section
12.1(f). The "Estimated Closing Purchase Price" shall mean: (a) $225,000,000,
plus (b) the Closing Cash Amount, if any (as set forth and represented in the
Closing Consideration Certificate delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.4(b)(xii)), minus (c) the Transaction Expenses (as set forth and represented
in the Closing Consideration Certificate delivered to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.4(b)(xii)), minus (d) the Closing Indebtedness Amount, if any (as
set forth and represented in the Closing Consideration Certificate delivered
to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(xii)), minus (e) the Net Working
Capital Shortfall Amount (as set forth and represented in the Closing
Consideration Certificate delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.4(b)(xii)), if any, plus (f) the Net Working Capital Surplus Amount (as set
forth and represented in the Closing Consideration Certificate delivered to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(xii)), if any, minus (g) the Escrow
Amount, minus (h) the Sellers' Representative Amount. Set forth on Schedule
1.2 is an estimate, as of the date of this Agreement, of the portion of the
Purchase Price payable by Purchaser to each Seller for all of the Purchased
Securities held by such Seller. On the Business Day prior to the Closing, the
Sellers' Representative will deliver an updated Schedule 1.2 (the "Updated Pro
Rata Portion Schedule"), which Updated Pro Rata Portion Schedule will be
consistent with the Company's Charter Documents and which will



result in all Pro Rata Portions totaling 100% and all Special Pro Rata
Portions totaling 100% and the portion of the Purchase Price payable by
Purchaser to each Seller for all of the Purchased Securities held by such
Seller shall be based on such Seller's Pro Rata Portion or Special Pro Rata
Portion, as applicable, as set forth in the Updated Pro Rata Portion Schedule.
Each of the Sellers hereby agrees to the allocations of the Purchase Price
contemplated in this Agreement (including in Schedule 1.2, as updated by the
Updated Pro Rata Portion Schedule) and forever waives and relinquishes any and
all rights to have the Purchase Price allocated in any other manner, whether
pursuant to any provision of the Company's Charter Documents or the terms and
conditions of any other Contract with, or for the benefit of, such Seller.

(b) Escrow. At the Closing, the General Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be
deposited into the General Indemnity Escrow Account and the Special Indemnity
Escrow Amount shall be deposited into the Special Indemnity Escrow Account, in
each case to be held and distributed by Citizens Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow
Agent") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

1.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Sellers' Representative a statement (the "Statement") setting forth its
calculation of the Closing Cash Amount, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount, the Net Working Capital
Shortfall Amount, if any, and the Net Working Capital Surplus Amount, if any,
and its resulting calculation of the Closing Purchase Price. The "Closing
Purchase Price" shall mean: (a) $225,000,000, plus (b) the Closing Cash
Amount, if any, minus (c) the Transaction Expenses, minus (d) the Closing
Indebtedness Amount, if any, minus (e) the Net Working Capital Shortfall
Amount, if any, plus (f) the Net Working Capital Surplus Amount, if any, minus
(g) the Escrow Amount, minus (h) the Sellers' Representative Amount.

(b) During the 60-day period following the Sellers' Representative's receipt
of the Statement, the Sellers' Representative and its accountants shall have
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the working papers of
Purchaser relating to the Statement. The Statement shall become final and
binding upon the Parties on the 60th day following delivery thereof, unless
the Sellers' Representative gives written notice of its disagreement with the
Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Purchaser on or before such date.
Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature
of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on the Closing Cash Amount, the Transaction
Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount, the
Net Working Capital Shortfall Amount, the Net Working Capital Surplus Amount
or the resulting calculation of the Closing Purchase Price not being
calculated in accordance with this Agreement or a general objection if
Purchaser failed to provide reasonable access needed to make a specific
objection. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser in a timely
manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall
become final and binding upon the Sellers and Purchaser on the earlier of (A)
the date the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified



in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the 60-day period following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to resolve
in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Purchaser and its
accountants shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
working papers of the Sellers' Representative prepared in connection with the
Notice of Disagreement.

(c) At the end of such 60-day period, the Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "Accounting
Firm") for resolution any and all matters that remain in dispute and that were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. No later than 60 days after
Purchaser's receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser may prepare and
deliver to the Sellers' Representative a reply setting forth alternative
positions with respect to the issues raised in the Statement or the Notice of
Disagreement (the "Reply"). The Accounting Firm shall not consider any issues
not raised in the Statement, the Notice of Disagreement or the Reply. The
Accounting Firm shall be Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to act, such other nationally-recognized independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative. The Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall jointly
request that the Accounting Firm render a decision resolving the matters
submitted to the Accounting Firm within 45 days after such submission. In
making its determination, the Accounting Firm shall: (i) not assign any value
to any item comprising the Closing Cash Amount, the Transaction Expenses, the
Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Net Working Capital Amount, the Net Working
Capital Shortfall Amount or the Net Working Capital Surplus Amount that is
less than the lowest amount attributed to such item by Purchaser or the
Sellers or greater than the highest amount attributed to such item by
Purchaser or the Sellers; (ii) not determine or question the Parties'
determination of any matter not properly included in the Notice of
Disagreement; and (iii) act as an expert only and not as an arbitrator or
moderator. The Accounting Firm shall set forth its determination of all such
issues in a written opinion, which opinion, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and not subject to appeal or further
review.

(d) The cost of engaging the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.3
shall be borne by Purchaser and the Sellers in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time its
determination is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. All other
fees and expenses incurred by Purchaser or the Sellers in connection with the
preparation, review or certification of the Statement, the Notice of
Disagreement or the Reply shall be borne by the party incurring such fees and
expenses.

(e) Adjustment Payments.

(i) If the Estimated Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Purchase Price
as determined in accordance with this Section 1.3, then, within ten Business
Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, each Seller
shall, and the Sellers'



Representative shall cause each Seller to, pay its Special Pro Rata Portion of
such excess to Purchaser.

(ii) If the Closing Purchase Price as determined in accordance with this
Section 1.3 exceeds the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, then, within ten
Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties,
Purchaser shall pay the amount of such excess to, or shall deposit with the
Paying Agent for distribution to, the Sellers in accordance with their Special
Pro Rata Portions of such excess.

(f) Closing Consideration Certificate. No later than three Business Days after
the Statement has become final and binding, the Sellers' Representative shall
update the Closing Consideration Certificate to reflect any change to any
amounts set forth therein that were based on estimates when such Closing
Consideration Certificate was delivered at the Closing, which Closing
Consideration Certificate, as so updated, shall thereafter be deemed to be the
final Closing Consideration Certificate for all purposes of this Agreement. In
addition, to the extent any additional amounts are required to be paid to the
Sellers as a result of any changes made to the Closing Consideration
Certificate delivered at the Closing, the Sellers' Representative shall
include in such update a statement setting forth with respect to any such
Seller the amount so required to be paid (which statement shall form part of
the Closing Consideration Certificate for all purposes of this Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.3(e), Purchaser shall
not be required to pay any amount unless and until such update to the Closing
Consideration Certificate is delivered to Purchaser.

1.4 Closing.

(a) Closing. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Sidley Austin
LLP, 1001 Page Mill Rd., Building 1, Palo Alto, CA 94304, on a date to be
designated by Purchaser, which shall be no later than the third Business Day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8 and 9 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such time and date as the
Parties may designate. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

relating to Taxes or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. Prior to

listed in the Closing Consideration Certificate), Purchaser shall notify the
Sellers of the obligation or entitlement to deduct and withhold and, if
applicable and to the extent practicable, provide such Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts
from such deduction and withholding (or reduce the amount of deduction and
withholding) under applicable Legal Requirements. Purchaser and the Company,
as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers to obtain such
information and tax forms that are available to reduce or eliminate any such
deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and subsequently paid to



the appropriate Governmental Body by Purchaser or the Company, Purchaser or
the Company, as the case may be, shall provide evidence that such deducted or
withheld amounts have been remitted to the applicable Governmental Body, and
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having

transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any provision of the Charter

constitutes sufficient notice of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any such provision and (ii) to the extent that any such notice
would have been required to have been given within a certain period of time
prior to the Closing, such Seller hereby expressly waives any such requirement
and agrees and consents to the occurrence of the Closing when and as required
by this Agreement.

1.8 Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price. As soon as reasonably

Representative, a balance sheet of the Company, as of the Closing Date, that
sets out the fair market value of the assets owned by the Company (as
determined for U.S. Tax purposes) on the Closing Date, which assets for the
avoidance of doubt shall not include the Spin-Off Assets, and the amounts of
the Liabilities of the Company (as determined for U.S. federal tax purposes)
on the Closing Date, which Liabilities for the avoidance of doubt shall not
include the Spin-Off Liabilities (collectively, the "Fair Market Value Balance
Sheet"). The Fair Market Value Balance Sheet shall allocate the fair market
value among the assets using the principles set forth in Schedule 1.8. As soon
as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Sellers' Representative shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and submit to Purchaser, a balance sheet of the Company that sets out
the Tax basis of the assets owned by the Company (as determined for U.S.
federal Tax purposes) on the Closing Date, which assets for the avoidance of
doubt shall not include the Spin-Off Assets, and the amount of Liabilities of
the Company (as determined for U.S. federal Tax purposes) on the Closing Date,
which Liabilities for the avoidance of doubt shall not include the Spin-Off
Liabilities (collectively, the "Tax Basis Balance Sheet"). The Fair Market
Value Balance Sheet and the Tax Basis Balance Sheet shall each contain
sufficient detail to permit the Parties to make the computations and
adjustments required under Section 743(b), Section 751 and Section 755 of the
Code. If, within 30 days of the later of Purchaser's submission of the Fair
Market Value Balance Sheet to the Sellers' Representative or the Sellers'
Representative's submission of the Tax Basis Balance Sheet to Purchaser,
either the Sellers' Representative notifies Purchaser that the Sellers'
Representative objects to the Fair Market Value Balance Sheet or Purchaser
notifies the Sellers' Representative that Purchaser objects to the Tax Basis
Balance Sheet, then the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser will negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute within 30 days. If following the good
faith negotiation of such dispute, the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser
are unable to reach an agreement on either or both of the Fair Market Value
Balance Sheet and the Tax Basis Balance Sheet, then with respect to the Fair
Market Value Balance Sheet and Tax Basis Balance Sheet each Party may report
for U.S. federal



tax purposes according to that Party's own determination of the fair market
value and tax basis of the assets owned by the Company, provided that in all
cases the principles of Schedule 1.8 continue to apply.

the related unaudited consolidated statement of income, unaudited consolidated
statement of members' equity and unaudited consolidated statement of cash
flows for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, in each case of the
foregoing clauses "(A)" and "(B)" as related to the Retained Business.
Information included in the Provided 340B Link Financial Statements regarding
PSG and PHSS is consistent with information regarding PSG and PHSS included in
the Provided Company Financial Statements.

(b) Fair Presentation. The Company Financial Statements are true and complete
in all material respects and present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Acquired Companies as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies
for the periods covered thereby. The Company Financial Statements have been,
as of the date delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered, except that the financial statements referred to in Section
2.4(a)(i)(B) and Section 6.15(a)(i) do not contain notes. The 340B Link
Financial Statements are true and complete in all material respects and
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Retained Business as of the respective dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows of the Retained Business for the periods covered
thereby. The 340B Link Financial Statements have been, as of date delivered to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered, except that the
financial statements referred to in Section 2.4(a)(ii)(B), Section 6.15(a)(ii)
and Section 6.15(b) do not contain notes.

(c) Internal Controls. The books, records and accounts of the Acquired
Companies accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the
transactions in and dispositions



of the assets of the Acquired Companies. The systems of internal accounting
controls maintained by each Acquired Company are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. No Acquired Company has identified or
been made aware of: (i) any deficiency or material weakness in the system of
internal accounting controls utilized by such Acquired Company; (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves such Acquired Company's
management or other Company Service Providers who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by such Acquired Company; or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing. Part 2.4(c) of the Disclosure Schedule lists, and the
Company has Made Available to Purchaser copies of, all written descriptions
of, and all policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such internal
accounting controls.

(d) Accounts Receivable. Part 2.4(d) of the Disclosure Schedule provides an
accurate reconciliation of all accounts receivable, notes receivable and other
receivables of the Retained Business as of the Balance Sheet Date. All
existing accounts receivable of the Retained Business (including those
accounts receivable of the Retained Business reflected on the Company
Financial Statements that have not yet been collected and those accounts
receivable of the Retained Business that have arisen since the Balance Sheet
Date and have not yet been collected) represent valid obligations arising from
bona fide transactions entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and not
in violation of applicable Legal Requirements. All existing accounts
receivable of the Retained Business are and will be fully collectible within
180 days. There is no Encumbrance (except for Permitted Encumbrances) on any
of such accounts receivable, and no request or agreement for deduction or
discount has been made with respect to any of such accounts receivable, except
as fully and adequately reflected in reserves for doubtful accounts set forth
in the Company Financial Statements. None of the accounts receivable of the
Retained Business have been assigned or pledged to any other Person, and no
further goods are required to be provided and no further services are required
to be rendered in order to complete the sales and fully render the services so
as to entitle PSG, 340B OpCo or PHSS, as applicable, to collect the accounts
receivable in full.

(e) Insider Receivables and Insider Payables. Part 2.4(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule provides an accurate and complete breakdown of: (i) all amounts
(including any Indebtedness) owed to any Acquired Company by any member of the
Company ("Insider Receivables") as of the date of this Agreement; and (ii) all
amounts owed by any Acquired Company to any member of the Company ("Insider
Payables"). There will be no outstanding Insider Receivables or Insider
Payables as of the Closing.



2.5 No Liabilities; Indebtedness.

(a) Absence of Liabilities. No Acquired Company has any Liabilities of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, matured, unmatured or otherwise
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and whether due or to become due), other than: (i)
Liabilities identified as such in the "liabilities" column of the Balance
Sheet; (ii) accounts payable or accrued salaries and other employee
compensation that have been incurred by the Acquired Companies since the
Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business; and (iii) the
Liabilities identified in Part 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Accounts Payable. Part 2.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule provides an
accurate and complete breakdown and aging of: (i) all accounts payable of each
Acquired Company as of the date of this Agreement; and (ii) all notes payable
of each Acquired Company as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) Indebtedness. Part 2.5(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of each item of Indebtedness of each Acquired Company as of
the date of this Agreement, identifying the creditor to which such
Indebtedness is owed, the address of such creditor, the title of the
instrument (including all amendments and supplements thereto) under which such
Indebtedness is owed, the outstanding balance, the maturity date and the
collateral, if any, securing such Indebtedness. No Indebtedness contains any
restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any of such Indebtedness, (ii) the
incurrence of any other Indebtedness by any Acquired Company or (iii) the
ability of any Acquired Company to grant any Encumbrance on any of its assets.
With respect to each item of Indebtedness, no Acquired Company is in default
and no payments are past due. No Acquired Company has received any written or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice of a default, alleged failure to
perform or any offset or counterclaim (in each case, that has not been waived
or remains pending as of the date of this Agreement) with respect to any item
of Indebtedness. Neither the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement nor the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or any of the other agreements, documents or instruments
referred to in this Agreement will result in a default or breach of the terms
of, or accelerate the maturity of or performance under, any conditions,
covenants or other terms of any such Indebtedness. No Acquired Company has
guaranteed or is responsible for any Indebtedness of any other Person, and no
Acquired Company has guaranteed any other obligation of any other Person.

(d) No "Off-Balance Sheet" Arrangements. No Acquired Company has ever effected
or has ever otherwise been involved in any "off-balance sheet arrangements"
(as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

2.6 Absence of Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date:

(a) each Acquired Company has conducted its business only in the Ordinary
Course of Business, other than remote working arrangements and travel
limitations undertaken with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak;

(b) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect;



(c) there has not been any material loss, damage or destruction to, or any
material interruption in the use of, any of any Acquired Company's material
assets (whether or not covered by insurance); and

(d) as of the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company has taken any action
that would have been prohibited or otherwise restricted under Section 6.2
hereof, had such action been taken during the Pre-Closing Period.

2.7 Title to Assets.

(a) Good Title. Each Acquired Company owns, and has good and valid title to,
all material assets purported to be owned by it, including: (i) all assets
reflected on the Balance Sheet; and (ii) all other material assets reflected
in the books and records of such Acquired Company as being owned by such
Acquired Company. All of said assets are owned by each Acquired Company free
and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) Leased Assets. Part 2.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies all
material assets of each Acquired Company that are being leased to such
Acquired Company. Each Acquired Company has valid leasehold interests in such
leased assets, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances.

(c) Sufficiency of Assets. The assets owned, leased or licensed by the
Acquired Companies (excluding the Spin-Off Assets and rights to services to be
provided to the Acquired Companies under the Transition Services Agreement)
collectively constitute all of the properties, rights, interests and other
tangible and intangible assets used in or necessary to enable the Acquired
Companies to conduct, in all material respects, the Retained Business in the
manner in which such business is currently being conducted and in the manner
in which such business is currently proposed to be conducted immediately after
the Closing.

2.8 Bank Accounts.

(a) Part 2.8(a) of the Disclosure Schedule provides the following information
with respect to each account maintained by or for the benefit of each Acquired
Company at any bank or other financial institution (including the 340B
Accounts): (i) the name of the bank or other financial institution at which
such account is maintained; (ii) the account number; (iii) the type of
account; and (iv) the names of all Persons who are authorized to: (A) sign
checks or other documents with respect to such account or transfer amounts
from the relevant account; (B) access such account, view the account balance
and view the transactions with respect to such account, including all Persons
with online and remote access; and (C) input or release payments from such
account.

(b) No Acquired Company has any outstanding credit facility, overdraft, loan,
loan units, debenture, letter of credit, acceptance credit or other financial
facility. The aggregate balance of both 340B Accounts is sufficient to ensure
the Acquired Companies' full compliance



and performance of all distribution obligations of the Acquired Companies
under all of the Bank Model Contracts.

2.9 Equipment; Real Property.

(a) Equipment. All material items of equipment, fixtures and other tangible
assets owned by or leased to the Acquired Companies are adequate for the uses
to which they are being put, are in good condition and repair (ordinary wear
and tear excepted) and such equipment, fixtures and other tangible assets
(excluding the equipment, fixtures and other tangible assets that are Spin-Off
Assets) are adequate for the conduct of the Retained Business in the manner in
which such business is currently being conducted and in the manner in which
such business is currently proposed to be conducted immediately after the
Closing.

(b) Real Property. No Acquired Company owns any real property or has ever
owned any real property, and no Acquired Company is a party to any Contract to
purchase or sell any real property. Part 2.9(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of all real property currently leased, subleased or licensed
by or from any Acquired Company or otherwise used or occupied by any Acquired
Company (each, a "Leased Real Property"). Part 2.9(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties, licenses,
subleases or other Contracts for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or
otherwise granting a right in or relating to each Leased Real Property and all
amendments, terminations and modifications thereof (the "Lease Agreements").

(c) The Company has Made Available true, correct and complete copies of all
Lease Agreements. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or materially
impair the rights of any Acquired Company or materially alter the rights or
obligations of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Lease
Agreement, or otherwise materially and adversely affect the continued use and
possession of any Leased Real Property for the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies as presently conducted or as presently contemplated to be
conducted. The Acquired Companies currently occupy all of the Leased Real
Properties for the operation of their business. There are no other parties
occupying, or with a right to occupy, any Leased Real Property. No Acquired
Company has assigned, transferred or pledged any interest in any of the real
property leases pertaining to any Leased Real Property. No Acquired Company
owes brokerage commissions or finders' fees with respect to any such Leased
Real Property. Each Acquired Company has performed all of its obligations
under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any
leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements for real property
that are no longer in effect and has no continuing Liability with respect to
such termination agreements. Each Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and is structurally
sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the Acquired Companies'
business. Neither the operation of any Acquired Company on any Leased Real
Property nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any Leased Real Property, including
the improvements thereon, violates in any material respect any



applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such
property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent on
so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

2.10 Intellectual Property.

(a) Registered IP. Part 2.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately sets
forth each item of Registered IP in which any Acquired Company has or purports
to have an ownership interest of any nature (whether exclusively, jointly with
another Person or otherwise) including:

(i) all Patents owned or filed by, or on behalf of, any Acquired Company or
used in the business or operations of any Acquired Company, or to which any
Acquired Company has exclusive rights, in any field or territory, including
the country of filing, owner, filing number, date of issue or filing,
expiration date and title;

(ii) all registered Trademarks and applications for registration of Trademarks
owned or filed by, or on behalf of, or used by any Acquired Company, including
country of filing, owner, description of goods or services (including class
numbers), registration or application number and date of issue;

(iii) all registered copyrights and applications for registration of
copyrights owned or filed by, or on behalf of, or used by any Acquired
Company, including description of the work, country of filing, owner, filing
number, date of issue and expiration date; and

(iv) all Domain Names and the like owned or registered by or on behalf of any
Acquired Company or used in the business or operations of any Acquired
Company, including the name and contact information of each registrant and
registrant organization.

Part 2.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule also accurately lists any other Person
that has or purports to have an ownership interest in any item of Registered
IP set forth or required to be set forth therein and the nature of such
ownership interest. The Company has Made Available to Purchaser complete and
accurate copies of all unpublished applications, nonpublic correspondence with
any Governmental Body and other material nonpublic documents related to each
item of Registered IP identified in Part 2.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Unregistered IP. Part 2.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately lists
(i) each unregistered Trademark, unregistered copyright and other Intellectual
Property Right other than Registered IP that is material to the business of
any Acquired Company in the manner in which such business is currently being
conducted or in the manner in which such business is currently planned by the
Acquired Companies to be conducted; and (ii) any other Person that has or
purports to have an ownership interest of any nature (whether exclusively,
jointly with another Person or otherwise) in such item of Company IP and the
nature of such ownership interest (collectively, "Unregistered IP"). The
Company has Made Available to Purchaser complete and accurate copies of all
material documents related to each such item of Company IP.



(c) Inbound Licenses. Part 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately sets
forth: (i) each Contract pursuant to which any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Right is or has been licensed, granted, sold, assigned
or otherwise conveyed or provided to any Acquired Company (other than: (A) any
Company Service Provider Agreement that is in the Acquired Companies' standard
form thereof Made Available to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.10(f); and (B)
non-exclusive licenses to "off-the-shelf" third party Computer Software that
is generally available on standard commercial terms for an aggregate license
fee for all of the Acquired Companies' internal users of less than $40,000
annually, provided that such Computer Software is not distributed by any
Acquired Company, is not incorporated into, or used in the development,
testing, distribution, delivery, maintenance or support of, any product or
service of any Acquired Company, and is not otherwise material to any Acquired
Company's business); and (ii) whether the licenses or rights granted to any
Acquired Company in each such Contract are exclusive or non-exclusive (such
Contracts, "Inbound Licenses"). For purposes of this Agreement, a covenant or
promise not to sue or not to assert claims regarding Intellectual Property
Rights infringement or misappropriation or similar releases shall be deemed to
be equivalent to a license.

(d) Outbound Licenses. Part 2.10(d) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately
lists each Contract pursuant to which any Person has been granted any license
under, or otherwise has received or acquired any right (whether or not
currently exercisable and including a right to receive a license) or interest
in, any Company IP or any Company Product (such Contracts, "Outbound
Licenses"). No Acquired Company is bound by, and no Company IP or Company
Product is subject to, any Contract containing any covenant or other provision
that in any way limits or restricts the ability of any Acquired Company to
use, exploit, make available, assert or enforce any Company IP or any Company
Product anywhere in the world.

(e) Royalty Obligations. Part 2.10(e) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of each Contract pursuant to which any Acquired
Company is obligated to pay any royalties, fees, commissions and other amounts
to any other Person upon or for the use of any Company Product, Intellectual
Property Rights or Intellectual Property (other than sales commissions paid to
employees).

(f) Standard Form Company IP Contracts. The Company has Made Available to
Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of each standard form of Company IP
Contract, used by any Acquired Company at any time, which may include a
standard form of: (i) end user license agreement, developer agreement,
subscription agreement or terms of use or service; (ii) development agreement;
(iii) Company Service Provider Agreement containing any assignment or license
of a Company Product, Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights or
any confidentiality provision; (iv) confidentiality or nondisclosure
agreement; (v) agreement to provide customer support or maintenance; (vi)
application programming interface (API) or data license agreement; (vii)
evaluation agreement; (viii) agreement for providing technology licensing,
distribution rights and/or managed services to customers; (ix) vendor
agreement; (x) credit agreement; (xi) sales agreement; (xii) partner
agreement; and (xiii) pre-production license and services customer agreement.
No Acquired Company has distributed or made available any Company Product
except pursuant to a valid and enforceable customer agreement, either in the



form Made Available to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.10(f) or as
otherwise set forth on Part 2.10(d) of the Disclosure Schedule. Each Acquired
Company has either ensured that each user of any Company Web Site is subject
to valid and enforceable web site terms of use in the form Made Available to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.10(f), or, if it has not imposed such
terms, its failure to do so has not exposed any Acquired Company to any
Liability or violated any Legal Requirement. To the extent any customer or
licensee of any Acquired Company is authorized to distribute or make available
any Company Products to its customers or to permit access to any Company
Products via its web site, such customer or licensee is required by such
Acquired Company to ensure that such customers or licensees and their end
users are bound by intellectual property and confidentiality terms consistent
with those contained in its agreement with such Acquired Company and such
Acquired Company is a third-party beneficiary of any such terms of use in the
form Made Available to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.10(f) including
any indemnification provisions. Part 2.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies each Company IP Contract based on a standard form
agreement Made Available to Purchaser that (i) deviates in any material
respect from such standard form agreement, including any Company Service
Provider Agreement, in which the employee, consultant, independent contractor,
advisor, officer or manager expressly reserved or retained any Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights related to any Acquired Company's
business, research or development, (ii) deviates from any Acquired Company's
standard revenue share terms or (iii) deviates from any Acquired Company's
standard data privacy or security terms or limitation of liability terms.

(g) Ownership Free and Clear. The Acquired Companies are the sole and
exclusive owners of all right, title and interest to and in the Company IP
(other than Intellectual Property Rights exclusively licensed to any Acquired
Company, as identified in Part 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule), free and
clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and nonexclusive
licenses granted pursuant to the Contracts listed in Part 2.10(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule). To the Company's Knowledge, all modifications and
derivative works of any Company IP made by any Person are exclusively owned by
the Acquired Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) all documents and instruments necessary to establish, perfect and maintain
the rights of the Acquired Companies (or the rights any Acquired Company
wishes to acquire) in the Registered IP have been validly executed, delivered
and filed in a timely manner with the appropriate Governmental Body;

(ii) each Company Service Provider who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any Company Product or of any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights for or on behalf of any Acquired Company has
signed a valid and enforceable agreement with such Acquired Company containing
(A) an obligation to assign all Intellectual Property Rights in any
Intellectual Property, including any procedures, systems, machines, methods,
processes, uses, apparatuses, compositions of matter, designs, configurations,
computer programs, copyrightable material, notes, records, drawings, trade and
service marks, trade dress and trade secrets of any kind, and any improvements
to any of the foregoing, that was conceived or developed by the Company
Service Provider during (i) his or her engagement with the



Acquired Company or (ii) a six-month period following the termination of the
Company Service Provider's engagement with the Acquired Company and that (a)
relates to or results from the actual or anticipated business, work, research,
investigations, products, or services of the Acquired Company, or (b) results,
to any extent, from use of any Acquired Company's premises or property, (B) an
automatic vesting in the Acquired Company of the copyright in any writings and
other works that may be copyrighted (including computer programs) that are (i)
related to the present, planned, or reasonably anticipated business of the
Acquired Company and (ii) prepared by the Company Service Provider during his
or her engagement with Acquired Company, to the extent such writings and other
works are deemed to be works for hire as permitted by law, (C) a waiver by the
Company Service Provider in any and all "moral rights" in any writings and
other works under Section 2.10(g)(ii)(B), to the extent such writings or other
works are not works for hire, and a present and irrevocable assignment of all
right, title, and interest, including copyright, to such writings and other
works considered not works for hire, (D) confidentiality provisions protecting
customer or prospective customer lists and information, customer or
prospective customer contact information, proposals, marketing and sales plans
and forecasts, financial and accounting information, accounts receivable
aging, customer payment histories and customer account activity reports,
costs, contracts, pricing information, employee information and compensation,
all designs, forms, manuals, policies, computer programs, computer codes
(including those designed or developed by the Company Service Provider during
his or her employment or engagement with the Acquired Company), data stored in
computer programs, spreadsheets, memorandum regarding the Acquired Company's
business and plans, analytics, electronically stored information of all such
information, and any other information that is not readily available to the
public and which the Acquired Company relies on to conduct its business and to
formulate its business plans and has reasonable expectations that such
information shall remain confidential, as well as any Trade Secrets as defined
by applicable laws. No such Company Service Provider has any obligation to any
other Person with respect to such Intellectual Property, Intellectual Property
Rights or Company Product;

(iii) each Company Service Provider who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any Company Product or of any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights for or on behalf of any Acquired Company has
received any and all amounts payable to such Company Service Provider for such
Company Service Provider's services;

(iv) each Acquired Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain
the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in all
Trade Secrets and other proprietary or confidential information pertaining to
any Acquired Company, the Company IP, the Company Products or the business of
the Acquired Companies;

(v) the Acquired Companies own or otherwise have, and after the Closing
(including after the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Spin-
Off Agreements) will continue to have, sufficient rights in all Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights needed to conduct the Retained
Business as currently conducted and currently planned by the Acquired
Companies to be conducted;



(vi) no funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Body or any
university or educational or medical institution were ever sought, applied
for, received or used or took part, directly or indirectly, to develop,
research, create or exploit, in whole or in part, any Company IP or Company
Product;

(vii) no Company Service Provider who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any material portion of a Company Product or of any material
Intellectual Property or material Intellectual Property Rights for or on
behalf of any Acquired Company is subject, or was subject, at the time such
Company Service Provider was providing services to any Acquired Company, to
any Contract with any other Person or Legal Requirement which requires such
Company Service Provider to (A) notify or report any development of
Intellectual Property, (B) assign to any other Person any interest or other
Intellectual Property Right in any Company IP or (C) keep confidential any
Trade Secrets, proprietary data or other business or technical information
embodied in any Company IP;

(viii) to the Knowledge of the Company, during the period in which any Company
Service Provider was developing any Company Product or any Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights, no such Person was (i) employed by
any third party that has any rights in such Company Product, Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) involved in any consulting
relationship with any third party that has any rights in such Company Product,
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no part of any Company Product, Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights that was developed by any Company Service Provider was
developed during working hours for, or on any premises, equipment, computers,
electronic devices, machines or design tools of, any former or current Person
to which such Company Service Provider has provided services in any capacity;

(ix) no Acquired Company has performed, nor is any Acquired Company under any
obligation under any Contract to perform, any development services for any
Person where the deliverables or other results of such development services
would be owned by such Person, or exclusively licensed to such Person or where
any Acquired Company has otherwise granted any ownership interest of any
nature (whether exclusively, jointly with another Person or otherwise) to such
Person;

(x) (A) no Company Service Provider has any valid basis for claiming that any
Acquired Company has breached provisions of its Contracts with such Company
Service Provider that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
any Acquired Company's ownership rights in any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights under such Contracts; and (B) no Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights owned by any such Company Service
Provider or any former employer of any such Company Service Provider has been
incorporated into or used in the development of any Company Products; and

(xi) no Acquired Company is now or has ever been a member or promoter of, or a
contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar organization that
requires or obligates any Acquired Company to grant or offer to any other
Person any license or right to any Company IP.



(h) Valid and Enforceable. All Company IP is valid, subsisting and
enforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) no Trademark owned, used or applied for by or on behalf of any Acquired
Company conflicts or interferes with, or is confusingly similar to, any
Trademark owned, used or applied for by any other Person, and each Acquired
Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to police the use of its
Trademarks;

(ii) Part 2.10(h)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies and
describes each action, filing and payment that must be taken or made on or
before the date that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement in order to
maintain an item of Company IP in full force and effect;

(iii) no interference, opposition, cancellation, reissue, inter partes review,
post grant review, re-examination or other Legal Proceeding is or has been
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the scope,
validity or enforceability of any Company IP is being, has been or would
reasonably be expected to be contested or challenged, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no valid basis for a claim that any Company IP is
invalid or unenforceable;

(iv) all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in respect of
the Company IP owned by any Acquired Company that is Registered IP have been
paid and all necessary documents and certificates have been filed with the
relevant Governmental Body for the purpose of maintaining such Company IP; and

(v) no act has been done or omitted to be done by any Acquired Company, which
has had or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially and
adversely impairing or dedicating to the public, or entitling any Person to
cancel, forfeit, modify or consider abandoned, any Company IP.

(i) No Third Party Infringement of Company IP. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, and
no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating,
any Company IP. Part 2.10(i) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies
(and the Company has Made Available to Purchaser a complete and accurate copy
of) each letter or other written or electronic communication or correspondence
that has been sent by or to any Acquired Company or any Representative of any
Acquired Company regarding any actual, alleged or suspected infringement or
misappropriation of any Company IP, in each case, for Purchaser to fully
understand the history and analysis thereof (including any admission made by
any Acquired Company), and provides a brief description of the current status
of the matter referred to in such letter, communication or correspondence.

(j) Effects of This Transaction. Neither the execution, delivery nor
performance of this Agreement or any other agreements referred to in this
Agreement (including the Spin-Off Agreements and the Transition Services
Agreement) nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any such other agreement entered into in



connection herewith or therewith (including the Spin-Off Agreements and the
Transition Services Agreement) will, with or without notice or lapse of time,
result in, or give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare:
(i) a loss of, or Encumbrance on, any Company IP or any Company Product; (ii)
a material breach of or default under, or right to terminate or suspend
performance of, any Company IP Contract; (iii) the release, disclosure or

or (v) by the terms of any Company Contract, a reduction of any royalties,
revenue sharing or other payments any Acquired Company would otherwise be
entitled to with respect to any Company IP.

(k) No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights. Neither any Acquired Company nor
any of its employees, managers or officers (acting in such capacity) is
currently or has ever infringed (directly, secondarily, contributorily, by
inducement or otherwise), misappropriated or otherwise violated or made
unlawful use of any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right of
any other Person. No Company Software, no Company Data and no Company Product
has ever or currently infringes, misappropriates, violates or makes unlawful
use of any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right of, or
contains any Intellectual Property misappropriated from, any other Person.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

Property Rights of another Person, including any letter or other communication

to or a covenant not to sue with respect to any Intellectual Property Right of
another Person; and

(iii) no Acquired Company is bound by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold
harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to, or otherwise assumed
or agreed to discharge or otherwise take responsibility for, any existing or
potential Intellectual Property Rights infringement, misappropriation or
similar claim (other than indemnification provisions in the Acquired
Companies' standard forms of Company IP Contracts Made Available to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.10(f)).



Part 2.10(k) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies (and the Company
has Made Available to Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of) each letter
or other written communication or correspondence that has been sent by or to
any Acquired Company or any Representative of any Acquired Company regarding
any third party allegations of any Acquired Company or Company Product
infringing or misappropriating any third party's Intellectual Property Rights,
in each case, for Purchaser to fully understand the history and analysis
thereof (including any admission made by any Acquired Company), and provides a
brief description of the current status of the matter referred to in such
letter, communication or correspondence.

(l) No Harmful Code. None of the Company Owned Software contains any "back
door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as
such terms are commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code
designed or intended to have, or capable of performing, any of the following
functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming or otherwise impeding in any
manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer
system or network or other device on which such code is stored or installed;
or (ii) accessing, damaging or destroying any data or file without the user's
consent. None of the Company Software contains any "back doors" or other
undocumented access mechanism allowing unauthorized access to, viewing of,
manipulation of or modification or other changes to, any software or Company
IT Systems.

(m) Bugs. None of the Company Owned Software: (i) contains any material bug,
defect or error that adversely affects the use, functionality or performance
of such Company Software or any product or system containing or used in
conjunction with such Company Software; or (ii) fails to comply with any

functionality or performance of such Company Software or any product or system
containing or used in conjunction with such Company Software. The Company has
Made Available to Purchaser a complete and accurate list of all known bugs,
defects and errors in each version of the Company Software.

(n) Source Code. No source code for any Company Software has been delivered,
licensed or made available to any escrow agent or other Person who is not an
employee of any Acquired Company. No Acquired Company has any duty or
obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or
make available the source code for any Company Software to any escrow agent or
other Person. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in the delivery, license or disclosure of the source code
for any Company Software to any other Person. No Person has, or shall have, in
connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this

Providers, in each case that are owned (or purported to be owned) by an
Acquired Company and used in or necessary to the conduct of the



Retained Business (the "Retained Business IT Systems"). All Company IT Systems
are configured and perform in accordance with commercially reasonable security
standards, including all security standards to which any Acquired Company
claims compliance. The configuration and set-up of all Company IT Systems are
documented pursuant to generally-accepted standards within the information
technology industry and the industry in which any Acquired Company conducts
its business. Neither any Acquired Company's operation and maintenance of any
Company IT System nor the running and updating of the computer programs
developed by any Acquired Company are dependent on any individual employee or
third party and such operation and maintenance and running and updating can be
carried out by a skilled computer technician or expert. All Company IT Systems
(including all computer hardware and software, including rented, leased and
borrowed hardware and all programs available on and run by the computer
systems) are fully functional and no material errors or defects which have not
been fully remedied have been discovered therein. No Acquired Company is in
breach of any Contract related to any Company IT System nor is any Acquired
Company aware of any event that may constitute a material breach of any
Company Contract related to any User Data, Personal Data, Company Data or
Company IT Systems. The Company IT Systems that are not Spin-Off Assets
operate and perform as is necessary to conduct the Retained Business as
currently conducted and as currently contemplated by the Acquired Companies to
be conducted.

Open Source Code (A) was or is used in connection with the development of any
Company Owned Software, (B) was or is incorporated (including as a programming
dependency) in whole or in part into or otherwise forms any part of any
Company Owned Software or (C) has been or is distributed by or for any
Acquired Company, or has been or is made available by any Acquired Company in
whole or in part, in conjunction with or for use with any Company Owned
Software.

(iii) No Acquired Company has used Open Source Code in such a way that (A)
creates or purports to create any obligations for any Acquired Company with
respect to any Company Owned Software or Company IP or (B) grants or purports
to grant to any third party any rights or immunities under any Company IP.
Each Acquired Company is in material compliance with all terms and conditions
of all relevant licenses for Open Source Code (including all requirements
relating to notices and making Open Source Code available to third parties).



(iv) Part 2.10(p)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
Intellectual Property that any Acquired Company or any Company Service
Provider has contributed to an open source project or made available under an

each Company Privacy Notice (i) the period of time during which such Company
Privacy Notice was or has been in effect; (ii) whether the terms of a later
Company Privacy Notice apply to the data or information collected under such
Company Privacy Notice; and (iii) if applicable, the mechanisms (such as opt
in, opt out or notice only) used to apply a later Company Privacy Notice to
data or information previously collected under such Company Privacy Notice.
Each Company Privacy Notice complies with applicable Privacy Requirements.

(r) Privacy Compliance. Each Acquired Company and all third parties acting on
behalf of any Acquired Company (i) have at all times complied in all material
respects with all of the Company Privacy Policies and with all applicable
Privacy Requirements and Company Contracts relating to privacy, security or
Personal Data; (ii) have not received any written or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, oral notice (including any enforcement notice), letter or complaint
from a Governmental Body or any Person alleging any noncompliance or potential
noncompliance with any applicable Privacy Requirements or Company Privacy
Policies, nor has it been subject to any Legal Proceeding relating to
compliance with Privacy Requirements or its Processing of Personal Data; and
(iii) no Acquired Company has been subject to any regulatory inquiries from
any Governmental Body regarding actual or potential noncompliance with
applicable Privacy Requirements.

(s) Execution, Delivery and Performance of the Agreement. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the other
agreements referred to in this Agreement (including the Spin-Off Agreements
and the Transition Services Agreement) nor the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any such other agreements
(including the Spin-Off Agreements and the Transition Services Agreement), nor
the receipt, possession or use by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser of
the User Data or Personal Data of any Company Service Provider or any other
data or information in the Company Databases, nor the assignment and transfer
of any Company IP, will result directly or indirectly in (i) any material
violation of any Company Privacy Policy, Privacy Requirement, Company Contract
or any other applicable Legal Requirement or (ii) requirement to notify any
Person or Governmental Authority under Company Privacy Policies, Privacy
Requirements or Company Contracts relating to privacy, security or Personal
Data. Access to and collection of all Company Data, Personal Data and User
Data currently used in the Retained Business or necessary for the conduct of
the Retained Business as currently conducted or currently contemplated by the
Acquired Companies to be conducted will not be terminated or discontinued and
will continue immediately after the Closing Date for Processing by the
Company, 340B OpCo and PHSS following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other agreements referred to in
this Agreement (including the Spin-Off Agreements and the Transition Services
Agreements) on substantially the same terms and conditions as existed
immediately before the consummation of the transactions contemplated by



this Agreement or any of the other agreements referred to in this Agreement
(including the Spin-Off Agreements and the Transition Services Agreements). No
Company Contract relating to privacy, security or Personal Data contains any
provision allowing a customer to terminate such Company Contract without cause
in a manner that would, or would reasonably be expected to, adversely impact
any Company Product, the operation of the Retained Business or any benefits
received by any Acquired Company under such Company Contract. The Acquired
Companies have not received any notice from any customer or other Person
indicating, suggesting or providing the Acquired Companies with reason to
believe that such Person intends to terminate any existing HIPAA business
associate agreement or other Company Contract with the Acquired Companies
relating to privacy, security or Personal Data.

(t) Processing of Personal Data. Part 2.10(t) of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies and describes each distinct electronic or other database containing
(in whole or in part) Personal Data Processed by or for any Acquired Company
at any time (each, a "Company Database"), the types of Personal Data in each
such database, the means by which the Personal Data was collected, the
security and retention policies that have been adopted and maintained with
respect to each such database, the geographical location(s) of each such
database and whether such database has been registered with any Governmental
Body. Each Company Database that is required to be registered under any
applicable Legal Requirement has been duly registered and maintained. Each
Acquired Company and each third party acting on behalf of any Acquired Company
has acquired, collected, transferred and used all Personal Data in accordance
with the terms of, valid and enforceable Contracts. No Acquired Company has
Processed any Personal Data or any data that is not publicly available in
material violation or breach of any Company Contract or applicable Privacy
Requirement. To the extent commercially reasonable for the nature and
sensitivity of the Personal Data being Processed, or required by applicable
Privacy Requirements or Company Privacy Policies, (i) Personal Data is stored
and transmitted by each Acquired Company in an encrypted manner and (ii)
Personal Data is not maintained by any Acquired Company for longer than is
required. There is no complaint or any audit, Legal Proceeding, investigation
or claim currently pending against any Acquired Company by any Person or
Governmental Body in respect of Personal Data or User Data.

(u) Government and University Rights. No facilities of any Governmental Body,
university, college, hospital, other medical or educational institution or
research center or funding from any Governmental Body or third parties was
used in the development of any Company IP. No current or former employee of
any Acquired Company, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no other Company
Service Provider who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or
development of, any Company IP, was employed by or has performed services for
any Governmental Body, university, college, hospital or other medical or
educational institution or research center during a period of time during
which such Company Service Provider was also involved in, or contributing to,
the creation or development of any Company IP or otherwise performing services
for any Acquired Company. No Governmental Body, university, college, hospital
or other medical or educational institution or research center has any rights
whatsoever in any Company IP.



(v) Information Security. Each Acquired Company has established and has
adhered to a written information security program (the "Information Security
Program") that complies in all material respects with applicable Privacy
Requirements and that: (i) includes administrative, technical and physical
safeguards that are commercially reasonable for the protection of Personal
Data (and, in particular, "electronic protected health information" ("ePHI")
as defined under Privacy Requirements) and which protect the security,
confidentiality and integrity of any Company Data, User Data or Personal Data
owned, controlled, maintained, held or Processed by any Acquired Company or
any third party operating on behalf of or at the direction of any Acquired
Company; (ii) includes policies and procedures regarding Personal Data and the
Processing thereof, as well as disaster recovery, business continuity,
incident response and security plans, procedures and facilities; (iii)
protects against Malicious Code, Data Breaches, denial-of-service attacks,
business interruptions and unauthorized access to and Processing of the
Company IT Systems, Personal Data, User Data and Company Data and the systems
of any third party service providers that have access to such data or Company
IT Systems; and (iv) uses reasonable encryption methods that comply with
Privacy Requirements and Company Privacy Policies for transmission of
information (and, in particular, ePHI) across wireless and wired networks and
storage of Personal Data according to its sensitivity and proportional to the
risk that the inappropriate use or disclosure of that information could cause
financial, physical or reputational harm to an individual. Each Acquired
Company has tested its Information Security Program on a no less than an
annual basis, remediated all critical, high and medium risks, and the
Information Security Program has proven sufficient and compliant with Privacy
Requirements in all material respects. No Acquired Company or, to the
Company's Knowledge, any third party operating on its behalf has ever suffered
a Data Breach, or has ever been actually or potentially liable for, or
required to notify any Person or Governmental Body of, any Data Breach, and no
Acquired Company has been materially and adversely affected by any denial-of-
service attacks, business interruption, Malicious Code or threats to
maintaining the security, confidentiality or integrity of Company Data, User
Data or Personal Data. No breach or violation of the Information Security
Program has occurred or, to the Company's Knowledge, is threatened. The
Company IT Systems that are not Spin-Off Assets do not contain any Malicious
Code.

Company's (including any of its Representatives or other Person associated
with or acting on its behalf) activities that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any future violations, settlements or Legal Proceedings under any

Disclosure Schedule are valid and in full force and effect, and the
Governmental Authorizations identified in Part 2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule
that are not Spin-Off Assets collectively constitute all Governmental
Authorizations necessary to enable the Company, 340B OpCo and PHSS to conduct
the Retained Business in the manner in which such business is currently being
conducted and currently planned by the Acquired Companies to be conducted in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Each Acquired Company is,
and has at all times been, in compliance, in all material respects, with the
terms and requirements of the respective Governmental Authorizations
identified in Part 2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule. No event has occurred
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a material default or violation of any term, condition or provision
of any such Governmental Authorization. No Acquired Company has ever received
any written notice or other written communication or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any oral notice or other oral communication from any Governmental
Body regarding (x) any actual



or possible violation of or failure to comply with any term or requirement of
any Governmental Authorization, (y) any actual or possible revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any
Governmental Authorization or (z) any failure to obtain or receive any
Governmental Authorization. None of the Company IP or any Company Product is
subject to import or export licensing requirements. Each Acquired Company has
filed all applications that are required to have been filed for the obtaining,
renewal or upkeep of any Governmental Authorization on a timely basis, or with
appropriate extensions, each with the appropriate Governmental Body and all
fees or other amounts required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid to the appropriate Governmental Body. Each Acquired Company has filed
with the appropriate Governmental Bodies, all material reports, statements,
documents, registrations, waivers, filings or submissions required to be filed
by it. Each of such reports, statements, documents, registrations, waivers,
filings and submissions complied with applicable Legal Requirements, and no
deficiencies have been asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to such
reports, statements, documents, registrations, waivers, filings or submissions
that have not been cured.

2.14 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Returns and Payments. All Tax Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to any Acquired Company with any Governmental Body have been timely
(taking into account applicable extensions) and properly filed, were prepared
in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and are true, accurate
and complete and disclose all Taxes required to be paid by or with respect to
any Acquired Company for the periods covered thereby. All Taxes of the
Acquired Companies that are due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax
Return) have been timely and properly paid or properly accrued (or reserved
for), including all actual and contingent Tax liabilities, in accordance with
GAAP,. No extension of time within which to file any Tax Return is currently
in effect. The Company has Made Available to Purchaser accurate and complete
copies of all Tax Returns filed by the Acquired Companies for the tax years
ending on December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019,
including examination reports and all statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by any Acquired Company, filed or received since their
inception. There are no jurisdictions in which any Acquired Company is
required to file a Tax Return other than the jurisdictions in which such
Acquired Company presently files Tax Returns. No unresolved written claim has
ever been made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, asserted by an authority
in a jurisdiction where any Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that
such Acquired Company is, or may be, required to file a Tax Return in, or
subject to Taxation by that jurisdiction. The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired
Companies (A) did not, as of the Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for
Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face
of the Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and (B) do not exceed
that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies in
filing their Tax Returns. Since the Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company
has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the Ordinary Course of Business.
Any related party transactions that have been carried out among related
parties as defined in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements have been
made at arm's length and in full compliance with any transfer pricing



Legal Requirements, and the Acquired Companies maintain true and complete
records evidencing such circumstances.

(b) Audits; Claims. No Tax Return of any Acquired Company has ever been
audited by any Governmental Body. No Acquired Company has received from any
Governmental Body any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral: (i)
notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review of a Tax matter;
(ii) request for information related to material Tax matters; or (iii) notice
of deficiency or proposed Tax adjustment. No extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any income or franchise Tax Return or other
Tax Return has been granted by or requested from any Acquired Company with
respect to any currently open Tax period. No claim or Legal Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Acquired
Company in respect of any Tax. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon any of
the assets of any Acquired Company except for Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) Closing Agreements; Etc. No Acquired Company will be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the date of this
Agreement as a result of any change in method of accounting, closing
agreement, intercompany transaction, installment sale, open transaction,
election under Section 108(i) of the Code or prepaid amount received for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the date of this Agreement. No Acquired
Company is a party to or is bound by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement
(other than agreements entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business that
are not primarily related to Taxes). No Acquired Company has ever been a
member of an Affiliated Group. No power of attorney has been granted with
respect to any matter related to Taxes of any Acquired Company that on the
Closing Date will be in effect.

(d) Tax Incentives. Part 2.14(d) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth all Tax
exemptions, Tax holidays or other Tax reduction agreements or arrangements
applicable to any Acquired Company. The Company has Made Available to
Purchaser all documentation relating to any applicable Tax holidays or
incentives. Each Acquired Company is in material compliance with all
requirements and conditions for any applicable Tax holidays or incentives and
none of the Tax holidays or incentives will be jeopardized by the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, except where failure to be in compliance would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not materially and adversely affect the
remaining duration or the extent of any such Tax holiday or incentive or
require any recapture of any previously-claimed incentive, and no Consent of
any Governmental Body is required prior to the consummation of such
transactions in order to preserve the entitlement of any Acquired Company to
any such incentive. To the Knowledge of Company, no failure by any Acquired
Company to satisfy one or more requirements of any such incentive will
adversely affect the remaining duration or the extent of any such incentive or
require any recapture of any such previously-claimed incentive.



(e) Tax Withholding. Each Acquired Company has (i) complied in all respects
with all applicable Legal Requirements relating to the payment, reporting and
withholding of (and payment on account of) Taxes, (ii) within the time and in
the manner prescribed by Legal Requirements, withheld from employee wages,
consulting compensation or consideration payable to any independent
contractor, supplier, member or other third party and timely paid over to the
proper Governmental Bodies (or is properly holding for such timely payment)
all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under all applicable
Legal Requirements and (iii) timely filed all withholding Tax Returns, for all
periods.

the Ordinary Course of Business) or otherwise.

to a "reportable transaction" as defined in Section 6706A(c)(1) of the Code or
U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) or the Legal Requirements in
existence in any tax jurisdiction (including state and local tax
jurisdictions) in which any Acquired Company does business or (ii) has ever
engaged in any "listed transactions" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or the Legal Requirements in existence in any tax
jurisdiction (including state and local tax jurisdictions) in which any
Acquired Company does business.

(j) Foreign Taxes. No Acquired Company has, or has ever had, a permanent
establishment in any country other than the United States. No Acquired Company
is subject to Tax in any country other than the United States.

States shareholder (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code) of a
controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code)
or a shareholder of a "passive foreign investment company" (within the meaning
of Section 1297 of the Code). No Acquired Company is, or has ever been, a
direct or indirect party to any joint venture, partnership or other
arrangement that could be treated as a partnership for Tax purposes.

withholding under Section 1445 of the Code (related to "FIRPTA"), or any
similar state, local or non-U.S. Legal Requirement.

its formation, either classified as an entity disregarded from PSG or as a
partnership for all federal, state and local income Tax purposes. PSG is, and
has since the completion of the merger involving the Company and PSG been,
classified as an entity disregarded from the Company for all federal, state
and local income Tax purposes except in each case where such treatment is
inconsistent with relevant state or local Tax law and was, prior to the
completion of the merger involving the Company and PSG, classified as a
partnership for all federal, state and local income Tax purposes. PHSS is, and
has always been since the time of its formation, classified as an entity
disregarded from PSG for all federal, state and local income Tax purposes,
except in each case where such treatment is inconsistent with relevant state
or local Tax law. No Acquired Company has ever made an election to be treated
as a corporation for federal income or other Tax purposes.

(n) Tax Ownership of Property. No Acquired Company is treated as the owner of
any property for income Tax purposes that is owned by any other person for
non-income Tax purposes.

international boycott, within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code, or had
operations which are or may hereafter become reportable under Section 999 of

retiree life insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee
welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no
future costs to any Acquired Company, no Acquired Company has ever

Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code, each such Company Employee Plan has received a favorable IRS
determination letter or may rely on an opinion letter with respect to such
qualification and the Tax-exempt status of its related trust, and no

of such qualified status. No Company Employee Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Each Company Employee Plan can

Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will or would reasonably be expected to (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) constitute an event
under any Company Service Provider Agreement, Company Employee Plan, trust or
loan that will or could reasonably be expected to result (either alone or in
connection with any other circumstance or event) in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) with respect to any Company Service
Provider; or (ii) create or otherwise result in any Liability with respect to
any Company Service Provider Agreement or Company Employee Plan.

(l) Parachute Payments. No amount paid or payable in connection with the

employee representative body.

(p) No Misclassified Employees. Each Company Service Provider that has been
characterized as a contract laborer/worker, consultant or independent
contractor by an Acquired Company has been properly characterized as such. No
contract laborer/worker or independent contractor is eligible to participate
in any Company Employee Plan. No Acquired Company has any material Liability

Company has promised any contract laborer/worker, consultant, independent
contractor or intern an employee position within any Acquired Company.

any such slowdown, work stoppage, labor dispute or union organizing activity
or any similar activity or dispute. No Acquired Company is engaged, or has
ever engaged, in any unfair labor practice of any nature. There are no
actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any
labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any Company Service
Provider, including charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination
complaints.

(s) Labor Relations and Labor-Related Claims. There is no Legal Proceeding,

any Company Service Provider Agreement, compensation, wages and hours, leave
of absence, office or plant closing notification, employment statute or
regulation, privacy right, labor dispute, workers' compensation policy, long-
term disability policy, safety, harassment (including sexual harassment),
retaliation, equal opportunity, fair employment practices, immigration, work
authorization or discrimination matter involving any Company Service Provider,
including charges of unfair labor practices or harassment complaints. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts indicating that the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have a material
adverse effect on the labor relations of any Acquired Company. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably
anticipated claims or Legal Proceedings against any Acquired Company under any
workers' compensation policy or long-term disability policy or similar policy
subject to foreign Legal Requirements. No Acquired Company is a party to or is

Legal Proceeding involving such conduct.

(t) Severance, Etc. (i) The employment of each current Company Service
Provider is subject to termination upon not more than 30 days prior written
notice under the termination notice provisions included in the applicable
Company Service Provider Agreement with such Company Service Provider
identified or required to be identified in Part 2.15(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule or under applicable Legal Requirements without the payment of
severance; and (ii) no current Company Service Provider's employment by any
Acquired Company requires any special license, permit or other Governmental
Authorization.



(u) Deductions from Compensation. All amounts that any Acquired Company is
legally or contractually required to either: (i) deduct from its employees'
salaries and any other compensation or benefit or to transfer to such
employees' plans or (ii) withhold from employees' salaries and any other
compensation or benefit and to pay to any Governmental Body as required by any
applicable Legal Requirement, have been duly deducted, transferred, withheld
and paid, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and no Acquired
Company has any outstanding obligation to make any such deduction, transfer,
withholding or payment (other than routine payments, deductions or
withholdings to be timely made in the Ordinary Course of Business).

(v) Independent Contractors. Part 2.15(v) of the Disclosure Schedule

projected to be paid in the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2020.

All independent contractors can be terminated on notice of 30 days or less to
the independent contractor. All independent contractors are and all former
independent contractors were rightly classified as independent contractors and
would not reasonably be expected to be reclassified by any Governmental Body
as employees of any Acquired Company, for any purpose whatsoever. According to
the independent contractors' agreements with any of the Acquired Companies, no
independent contractor is entitled to any rights under the applicable



labor Legal Requirements. All current and former independent contractors have
received all of the rights to which they are and were entitled according to
any applicable Legal Requirements or Contracts with any of the Acquired
Companies. No Acquired Company engages temporary employees through third party
service providers.

2.16 Environmental Matters.

applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the possession by
such Acquired Company of all Environmental Licenses and other Governmental

written notice or other written communication or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any oral notice or other oral communication, whether from a
Governmental Body, citizens group, current or former Company Service Provider

Documents of the Blocker Entities; (ii) any indemnification agreement or other

perform or any offset or counterclaim (in each case, that has not been waived
or remains pending as of the date of this Agreement) with respect to any item
of Indebtedness. Neither the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement nor the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or any of the other agreements, documents or instruments
referred to in this Agreement will result in a default or breach of the terms
of, or accelerate the maturity of or performance under, any conditions,
covenants or other terms of any such Indebtedness. No Blocker Entity has
guaranteed or is responsible for any Indebtedness of any other Person, and no
Blocker Entity has guaranteed any other obligation of any other Person.

breached or committed any default under any Blocker Contract which remains
uncured and no other Person has, in any material respect, violated or breached
or committed any default under any Blocker Contract which remains uncured. No

without notice or lapse of time) will or would reasonably be expected to: (i)
result in a material violation or breach of any of the provisions of any
Blocker Contract; (ii) give any Person the right to declare a default or
exercise any remedy under any Blocker Contract; (iii) give any Person the
right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any Blocker Contract; or

Contract. No Blocker Entity has received any notice or other communication

rights under any Blocker Contract.



(d) No Renegotiation. No Person is actively renegotiating, or has a
contractual right pursuant to the terms of any Blocker Contract to
unilaterally renegotiate, any amount paid or payable to any Blocker Entity
under any Blocker Contract or any other material term or provision of any
Blocker Contract.

4.7 Compliance with Legal Requirements. Each Blocker Entity is, and has at all
times been, in compliance in all material respects with each Legal Requirement
that is applicable to it or to the conduct of its business or the ownership of

Taxes) by any Blocker Entity have been properly and timely withheld and

their inception. There are no jurisdictions in which any Blocker Entity is
required to file a Tax Return other than the jurisdictions in which such
Blocker Entity presently files Tax Returns. No claim has been made or asserted
in writing in the past three years by an authority in a jurisdiction where any
Blocker Entity does not file Tax Returns that such Blocker Entity is, or may
be, required to file a Tax Return in, or subject to Taxation by that
jurisdiction. No Blocker Entity has incurred any liability for Taxes outside
the Ordinary Course of Business (other than Taxes incurred solely with respect

Return of any Blocker Entity has ever been audited by any Governmental Body.
No Blocker Entity has received from any Governmental Body any written or, to
the Knowledge of Blocker, oral: (i) notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review of a Tax matter; (ii) request for information related to
material Tax matters; or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed Tax
adjustment. No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or threatened in writing
by any Governmental Body against any Blocker Entity in respect of any Tax.
There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon any of the assets of any Blocker
Entity except for Permitted Encumbrances. No Blocker Entity will be required
to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,
taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the

closing agreement, intercompany transaction, installment sale, open
transaction, election under Section 108(i) of the Code or prepaid amount
received for a taxable period ending on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Blocker is, and has always been since the time of its formation,
classified as an entity disregarded from Blocker Seller, and BWA Feeder is,
and has always been since the time of its formation, classified as a

Spinoff Employee's employment with SpinCo or any of the Spin-Off Entities for
any reason, provided, that Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser has not

contained in Section 11.1(a), but subject to Section 11.1(d), the Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect until the date that is six years following the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if, at any time on or prior to the applicable expiration date
referred to in this sentence, any Indemnitee delivers to the Sellers'
Representative a written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or
a breach of any Fundamental Representation and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 11.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive such date until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved.

(c) Purchaser Representations. The representations and warranties made by
Purchaser in this Agreement shall terminate and expire as of the Closing, and
any Liability of Purchaser with respect to such representations and warranties
shall thereupon cease.

(d) Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
11.1(a) or 11.1(b), the limitations set forth in Sections 11.1(a) and 11.1(b)
shall not apply in the case of claims based upon Fraud.

(e) Covenant Survival. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the covenants,
agreements and obligations that Purchaser, the Sellers, the Company and
Blocker are required to comply with or to perform at or prior to the Closing
shall survive the Closing until the date that is 12 months after the Closing
Date and (ii) all other covenants and agreements shall survive until the date
that is 30 days following the date on which the performance of such covenant
is due; provided, that, if there is no specified term of performance, such
covenant shall survive until the date that is 30 days after the date that no
Person can bring a Legal Proceeding in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements against Purchaser, the Company, Blocker or any of their
respective Affiliates.

(f) Representations Not Limited by Information. The Company, Blocker and the
Sellers agree that the Indemnitees' rights to indemnification, compensation
and reimbursement contained in this Section 11 relating to the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company, Blocker
and the Sellers set forth in this Agreement and in the Closing Certificates
are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement; and such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations set forth in this
Agreement and in the Closing Certificates, and the rights and remedies that
may be exercised by the Indemnitees with



respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited or otherwise affected by or as a
result of any knowledge on the part of any of the Indemnitees or any of their
Representatives (regardless of whether obtained through any investigation by
any Indemnitee or any Representative of any Indemnitee or through disclosure
(other than in the Disclosure Schedule) by the Company, Blocker, the Sellers
or any other Person, and regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement) or by reason of
the fact that an Indemnitee or any of its Representatives knew or should have
known that any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in
the Closing Certificates is or might be inaccurate or untrue.

(g) Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or
other item of information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be a qualification of or supplement to the representation and warranty made
by the Company, Blocker and the Sellers contained in this Agreement.

11.2 Indemnification.

Agreements Made by the Company. From and after the Closing (but subject to
Section 11.1), each Seller, severally (and not jointly and severally), shall
hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, such Seller's Pro
Rata Portion of any Damages (or, to the extent recovered from the General
Indemnity Escrow Funds, the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds or the Sellers'
Representative Fund, such Seller's Special Pro Rata Portion) that are suffered
or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third party claim) and that arise from or as a result of, or to the extent
connected with:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (without giving
effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
limiting the scope of such representation or warranty or any notification
pursuant to Section 6.4; except, with respect to this Section 11.2(a)(i), use
of the word "material" in the defined terms "Material Adverse Effect" and
"Material Contract" shall not be disregarded);

Company: (A) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was made
(x) on and as of immediately prior to the PSG Distribution and (y) on and as

without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications limiting the scope of such representation or warranty or any
notification pursuant to Section 6.4; except, with respect to this Section
11.2(a)(ii), the use of the word "material" in the defined terms "Material
Adverse Effect" and "Material Contract" shall not be disregarded);

Representative of any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be

(iv) any (A) Taxes payable by, relating to or imposed on any Acquired Company,
or for which any Acquired Company is liable (whether under any Legal
Requirement, under any Contract (other than a Contract entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business not relating primarily to Taxes), as a transferee
or successor or otherwise) (1) as a result of being or having been (or ceasing
to be) a member of an Affiliated Group on or before the Closing Date or (2)
for any taxable period of any Acquired Company ending on or before the Closing
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date (without giving effect to any
disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule and without limiting any
rights or remedies of any Indemnitee in the event of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty); provided, that, except as may be
otherwise required by Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76(b), for purposes of this
Agreement, the determination of Taxes of any Acquired Company or Blocker
Entity for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be determined on a closing-of-the-books basis by assuming
that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one of
which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date (with depreciation,
allowances, deductions or Taxes that are calculated on an annual basis, such
as property Taxes, apportioned on a daily basis) and by treating any other
Acquired Company or other Blocker Entity owned by such Acquired Company or
Blocker Entity as having a Straddle Period consisting of such two taxable
years or periods; (B) Transfer Taxes, if any, imposed on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, the amount of franchise Tax
shown on the Texas 2020 Return shall be allocated (x) to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period based on a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of days
in the taxable year prior to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator shall be 365, and (y) the remainder to the portion of the Straddle
Period that begins on the day after the Closing Date; and (C) social security,
Medicare, unemployment or other employment, withholding or payroll Taxes or
similar Taxes or amounts (together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax
or additional amount imposed by any Governmental Body with respect thereto)
owed by or imposed on Purchaser or any Acquired Company, or for which
Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates may
otherwise be liable, in each case, triggered in connection with, as a result
of or attributable to any payments made under this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to, or on
behalf of, any Company Service Provider, including any amounts released from
the Escrow Funds or payable in connection with distributions from the Escrow
Funds (all Taxes described in clauses "(A)", "(B)" and "(C)" and any Taxes
referred to in Section 11.2(a)(v) are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as "Acquired Company Pre-Closing Taxes"), in each case, to the
extent not taken into account in calculating Transaction Expenses or
Indebtedness;

(v) (A) the Post-DM Spin-Off, including any Taxes (including any Transfer
Taxes) or other Liabilities incurred on account of, or with respect to, the
Post-DM Spin-Off and (B) any Taxes (including any Transfer Taxes) incurred on
account of, or with respect to, the Divisional Merger; or



(vi) any matter set forth in Schedule 11.2(a)(vi).

(b) Indemnification with Respect to Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements Made by the Sellers. From and after the Closing (but subject to
Section 11.1), each Seller, on behalf of himself, herself or itself, shall
hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, all Damages that
are suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third party claim) and that arise from or as a result
of, or to the extent connected with:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (without giving
effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
limiting the scope of such representation or warranty or any notification
pursuant to Section 6.4);

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
such Seller: (A) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was
made on and as of the Closing; or (B) in such Seller's Individual Seller
Closing Certificate (in each case, without giving effect to any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications limiting the scope of such
representation or warranty or any notification pursuant to Section 6.4); or

(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of such Seller in this
Agreement required to be performed prior to, at or after the Closing.

(c) Indemnification with Respect to Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements Made by Blocker. From and after the Closing (but subject to Section
11.1), Blocker Seller shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the
Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the
Indemnitees for, all Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the
Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim)
and that arise from or as a result of, or to the extent connected with:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Blocker in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (in each case,
without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications limiting the scope of such representation or warranty or any
notification pursuant to Section 6.4);

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Blocker: (A) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was made
on and as of the Closing; or (B) in the Blocker Closing Certificate (in each
case, without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representation or warranty
or any notification pursuant to Section 6.4);

(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Blocker Entities in this
Agreement required to be performed prior to or at the Closing; or



(iv) any Taxes payable by, relating to or imposed on Blocker or any of the BWA
Entities, or for which Blocker or any of the BWA Entities is liable (whether
under any Legal Requirement, under any Contract (other than a Contract entered
into in the Ordinary Course of Business not relating primarily to Taxes), as a
transferee or successor or otherwise) (A) as a result of being or having been
(or ceasing to be) a member of an Affiliated Group on or before the Closing
Date or (B) subject to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b), for any
taxable period of Blocker or any BWA Entity ending on or before the Closing
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date (without giving effect to any
disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule and without limiting any
rights or remedies of any Indemnitee in the event of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty and including any Damages arising out
of, in connection with or incident to the determination, assessment or
collection of any such Tax) (all Taxes described in clauses "(A)" and "(B)"
are collectively referred to herein as "Blocker Entity Pre-Closing Taxes").

(d) Damage to Purchaser. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if any Blocker
Entity, the Company, 340B OpCo or PHSS suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes
subject to any Damages as a result of, or to the extent in connection with,
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of any Blocker Entity,
the Company, 340B OpCo or PHSS as an Indemnitee) Purchaser shall also be
deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the Purchased Securities, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and to the extent in connection with such
inaccuracy or breach.

11.3 Limitations.

(a) Deductible. Subject to Section 11.3(b), none of the Sellers shall be
required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) or
Section 11.2(a)(ii) until such time as the total amount of all Damages
(including the Damages arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
particular representation or warranty and all other Damages arising from any
inaccuracies in or breaches of any other representations or warranties) that
have been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to
which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject,
exceeds $843,750 in the aggregate (the "Deductible"). If the total amount of
such Damages exceeds the Deductible, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to
be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the portion of such
Damages exceeding the Deductible.

(b) Applicability of Deductible. The limitations set forth in Section 11.3(a)
shall not apply: (i) in the event of Fraud (whether on the part of any Seller,
any Blocker Entity or any Acquired Company); (ii) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations; or (iii) to any of the
matters referred to in Section 11.2(a)(iii) through Section 11.2(a)(vi),
inclusive, Section 11.2(b)(i) through Section 11.2(b)(iii), inclusive, and
Section 11.2(c)(i) through Section 11.2(c)(iv), inclusive.

case of Fraud pursuant to Section 11.3(c)(vi) and Section 11.3(d)).

(ii) Subject to Section 11.3(c)(vi) and Section 11.3(d), Damages that are

Damages relate to any third party claim) pursuant to (x) Section 11.2(a)(i) or
Section 11.2(a)(ii) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental
Representation (other than any Seller Representation, which shall be governed
by Section 11.3(c)(iii), or Blocker Representation, which shall be governed by
Section 11.3(c)(iv)) or (y) Section 11.2(a)(iv) shall, in each case, be

Portion); and (C) third, under the RandW Policy; provided, however, that, for

(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim)
with respect to the matters referred to in Section 11.2(b)(iii) shall be
recovered by the Indemnitees: (x) first, from the General Indemnity Escrow
Funds (to the extent remaining and available) until the General Indemnity

(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim)
due to Fraud on the part of any Acquired Company may be recovered by the
Indemnitees directly from the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata
Portions; (B) Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees
or to which any of the Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of

the part of any Seller may be recovered by the Indemnitees directly from the
applicable Seller who committed such Fraud; and (C) Damages that are suffered
or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to

recovered by the Indemnitees directly from Blocker Seller.

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in the event that
any Damages suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees hereunder are
recoverable as either a Covered Claim or a breach of a covenant, then, to the
extent reasonably expected to be recoverable under the RandW Policy, Purchaser
shall pursue recovery of such Damages first as a Covered Claim rather than as
a breach of a covenant; provided, that, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover
such Damages as a breach of a covenant to the extent that such Damages are not
reasonably likely to be recovered as a Covered Claim. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Covered Claim" means a claim for Damages (i) based upon a
breach of a representation and warranty, or (ii) under Section 11.2(a)(iv) or
Section 11.2(c)(iv).

(d) Cap.

(i) Except with respect to Fraud, no Seller shall have any Liability under
Section 11.2(a)(i) or Section 11.2(a)(ii) for breaches of or inaccuracies in
General Representations in excess of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds.

(ii) Except with respect to Fraud, the total amount of indemnification
payments that the Sellers may be required to make to the Indemnitees (x) under
Section 11.2(a)(i) or Section 11.2(a)(ii) for any breach of or inaccuracy in
any Fundamental Representation or under Section 11.2(a)(iv), (y) under Section
11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
Seller Representation or (z) under Section 11.2(c)(i) or Section 11.2(c)(ii)
for any breach of or inaccuracy in any Blocker Representation or under Section
11.2(c)(iv), as applicable, shall be limited (in the aggregate) to $1,687,500
(the "Fundamental Cap").

(iii) Except with respect to Fraud committed by such Seller or a Blocker
Entity, the total amount of indemnification payments that any Seller may be
required to make to the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iii), Section
11.2(a)(v) through Section 11.2(a)(vi), Section 11.2(b)(iii), Section
11.2(c)(iii) and due to Fraud committed by an Acquired Company or Spin-Off
Entity shall be limited (in the aggregate, when combined with all other
Damages paid by or on behalf of such Seller) to the aggregate consideration
that such Seller was entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.2 (prior to the
deduction of any Taxes).

(e) No Double Recovery; Mitigation. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
confer to or impose upon any Party a duplicative right, entitlement,
obligation or recovery



with respect to any matter arising out of the same facts and circumstances
(including with respect to the rights, entitlements, obligations and
recoveries that may arise out of one or more of the Sections contained
hereunder). Any Damages for which any Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 11 shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant.
No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for
any portion of Damages arising from a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of such portion of Damages
incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of
any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) that was already included
in a line item of the Net Working Capital Amount, the Transaction Expenses or
Closing Indebtedness Amount.

(f) Insurance Proceeds. The amount of any Damages that any Indemnitee may be
entitled to recover shall be reduced by the amount of any third party
insurance proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnitee from any third party
insurance carrier (net of any increase in insurance premiums, costs of
collections, deductible, retroactive or other premium adjustment,
reimbursement obligation or other costs directly related to the insurance
claim (together, "Insurance Costs")); provided, however, that the foregoing in
no way obligates any Indemnitee to purchase or maintain any third party
insurance policy (other than the RandW Policy). If an Indemnitee actually
receives any insurance proceeds as a result of a matter giving rise to any
indemnification claim of such Indemnitee prior to the date upon which the
Sellers' Representative is given a Claim Notice, the indemnification
obligation of the Sellers with respect to such claim shall be reduced by the
amount of any such insurance proceeds (net of costs and expenses of such
recovery and Insurance Costs) actually received by the Indemnitee. If the
Indemnitee actually receives any insurance proceeds directly arising from any
Damages after any of the Sellers have provided indemnification for such
Damages to the Indemnitee, then any excess Damages amount actually collected
(net of costs and expenses of such recovery and Insurance Costs) shall be
repaid to the Escrow Funds, or after release of the Escrow Funds, such amount
shall be paid to the Sellers. In the event any Damages incurred by an
Indemnitee are actually covered under the RandW Policy, each Indemnitee agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under the RandW Policy.

(g) Adjustments. All payments made pursuant to this Section 11 shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless otherwise
required by Legal Requirements, and such agreed treatment shall govern for
purposes of this Agreement.

(h) Calculation of Damages. For purposes of determining the amount of Damages
pursuant to Section 11.2, all qualifications and limitations as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect and words of similar import set forth in
this Agreement shall be disregarded.

11.4 No Contribution. Each Seller waives, acknowledges and agrees that such
Seller shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise
or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or advancement of
expenses or other right or remedy against any Blocker Entity, the Company,
340B OpCo or PHSS or their respective Representatives in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such Seller may



become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument delivered to Purchaser in connection with
this Agreement.

11.5 Claim Procedures. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to this Section 11 shall be brought and resolved
exclusively as follows:

(a) Notice of Claim. If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have
incurred or suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer,
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Section 11 or for which it is or may otherwise be
entitled to a monetary remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice
(a "Claim Notice") to the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller). Each Claim Notice
shall: (i) contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances
supporting the Indemnitee's claim; and (ii) if practicable, contain a non-
binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which the
Indemnitee might be entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may
be modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred
to as the "Claimed Amount").

(b) Dispute Procedure. During the 20-day period commencing upon receipt by the
Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller
Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee
(the "Dispute Period"), the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) may deliver to the
Indemnitee a written response (the "Response Notice") in which the Sellers'
Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification
Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification
Matter, Blocker Seller): (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to
the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is
owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount
is owed to the Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance
with clause "(ii)" or clause "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the Response
Notice shall also contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances
supporting the Sellers' Representative's (or applicable Seller's) claim that
only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as
the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed
to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed
Amount, if it is asserted in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed
Amount is owed to the Indemnitee) is referred to herein as the "Contested
Amount" (it being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from
time to time to reflect any good faith modifications by the Indemnitee to the
Claimed Amount).

(c) Deemed Agreement to Claimed Amount. If a Response Notice is not received
by the Indemnitee from the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Sellers' Representative (or, in the
case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the



applicable Seller and in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker
Seller) shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to
the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee and such amount shall be
deemed a "Determined Amount" as of the date of expiration of the Dispute
Period.

(d) Agreement to Full Claimed Amount. If the Sellers' Representative (or, (x)
in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable
Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker
Seller) in the Response Notice agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to
the Indemnitee, then the full Claimed Amount shall be deemed a "Determined
Amount" as of the date of delivery of the Response Notice.

(e) Partial Agreement to Claimed Amount. If the Sellers' Representative (or,
(x) in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable
Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker
Seller) delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period
agreeing that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee (the "Agreed Amount"), then such Agreed Amount shall become a
"Determined Amount" hereunder as of the date of delivery of the Response
Notice.

(f) Resolution between the Parties. If the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in
the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller
and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller)
delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period
expressly stating that there is a Contested Amount, the Sellers'
Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification
Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification
Matter, Blocker Seller) and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Sellers'
Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification
Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification
Matter, Blocker Seller) and the Indemnitee resolve such dispute, such
resolution shall be binding on the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the
case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and
(y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) and such
Indemnitee, and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such
Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by such Indemnitee, on
the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) on the other hand,
and the Stipulated Amount shall become a "Determined Amount" hereunder as of
the date such settlement agreement is executed or as of such other date as may
be provided for in the settlement agreement.

(g) Arbitration. In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim
Notice or Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on
the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller), on the other hand,
or it is a matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or
commenced by a third party brought against the Indemnitee, the Company, 340B
OpCo, PHSS or any Blocker Entity), such dispute (an "Arbitrable Dispute")
shall be settled by binding



arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Section
11.5(g) shall prevent a Party from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from
a Chosen Court of competent jurisdiction to maintain the status quo pending
resolution of any Arbitrable Dispute.

(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in the County of Santa Clara, State of California in
accordance with the JAMS' Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then
in effect (the "Arbitration Law"). However, in all events, the provisions
contained herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or
hereafter be contained in the Arbitration Law. Any judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial
proceeding were instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final
decision of the arbitrator will be furnished by the arbitrator to the Sellers'
Representative and the Indemnitee (and, in the case of an Individual Seller
Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and, in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) in writing and will constitute a
final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue in question,
binding upon the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers (or, (x) in the case of
an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in
the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) and the
Indemnitee, and an order with respect thereto may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be kept confidential by the
Indemnitee, the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers (or, (x) in the case
of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y)
in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller).

(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the
Indemnitee and the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the
case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller), but based upon
reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event
the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and the
Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller
Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller). In the event the Indemnitee and the
Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller
Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) are unable to agree on an arbitrator
within 20 days following submission of the dispute to arbitration by one of
the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list
of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)" hereof.

(iv) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other
relationship with the Indemnitee, Purchaser, any Acquired Company, any Spin-
Off Entity, any Blocker Entity, the Sellers' Representative, any of the
Sellers or any Affiliate, manager, director or officer of any of the
foregoing, unless following full disclosure of all such relationships, the
Indemnitee and the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an
Individual Seller



Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) agree in writing to waive such
requirement with respect to an individual in connection with any dispute.

(v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold an up to eight hour, one day
hearing regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his or her designation
and to render an award (without written opinion) no later than ten days after
the conclusion of such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed
in writing by the Indemnitee and the Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the
case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and
(y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller). The
final decision of the arbitrator: (A) shall include the amount of the award to
the Indemnitee (the "Award Amount"), if any; (B) shall be furnished to the
Sellers' Representative (or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller
Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker
Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) and the Indemnitee in writing; and (C)
shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issue(s) in question, shall
be binding upon the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers (or, (x) in the case
of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y)
in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) and the
Indemnitee and shall not be contested by any of them, and an order with
respect thereto may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(vi) The Indemnitee and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
(or, (x) in the case of an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the
applicable Seller and (y) in the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter,
Blocker Seller) will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to
the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and
other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings; provided,
however, that: (A) the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to
an award of attorneys' fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration,
including the 50% of initial compensation and expenses paid by the prevailing
party, will be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized
to determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. The
losing party shall be determined solely by the arbitrator. If an Indemnitee is
found to be the prevailing party in any arbitration, the amount of the fees
and expenses of such Indemnitee payable by the Sellers (or, (x) in the case of
an Individual Seller Indemnification Matter, the applicable Seller and (y) in
the case of a Blocker Indemnification Matter, Blocker Seller) pursuant to this
clause "(vi)" shall be added to and become a part of the Award Amount.

(vii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or any other provisions contained in this Section 11.5(g) or
elsewhere in this Agreement.

(viii) The Award Amount shall become a "Determined Amount" hereunder on the
date of entry of the arbitrator's decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction (such entry, the "Determined Order").

(ix) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
11.5(g), any claims arising out of, relating to or resulting from any Fraud or
any breach of covenant by a Party shall instead be brought before, and
adjudicated by, a Chosen Court.



11.6 Payment of Determined Amounts. After the date any amount becomes a
Determined Amount (the "Determination Date") pursuant to Section 11.5(c),
Section 11.5(d), Section 11.5(e), Section 11.5(f) or Section 11.5(g)(viii):
(a) Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall, within three Business Days
after the Determination Date, jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Determined Amount to
such Indemnitee from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds or the Special
Indemnity Escrow Funds, as applicable, provided, however, that if the Sellers'
Representative fails to execute and deliver such written notice within such
three Business Day period, Purchaser's unilateral execution and delivery of
such written notice (and, in the event of any amount becoming a Determined
Amount pursuant to Section 11.5(g)(viii), together with a copy of the
Determined Order) shall constitute binding instructions to the Escrow Agent by
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative to release the Determined Amount to
the Indemnitee from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds or the Special
Indemnity Escrow Funds, as applicable, subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; and (b) if the applicable Escrow Funds are insufficient to cover
the full Determined Amount, then, the Indemnitees shall recover such
deficiency under the RandW Policy, directly from the Sellers in accordance with
their Pro Rata Portions or directly from the applicable Sellers, as
applicable, in each case pursuant to Section 11.3(c); provided, that if any
Seller is responsible for such deficiency or any part of such deficiency
pursuant to Section 11.3(c), such Seller shall make such payment within ten
Business Days following the Determination Date.

11.7 Escrow Matters. Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement:

(a) First Recourse to Escrow Fund. Other than pursuant to Section 11.3(c)(vi),
so long as the portion of the amount in the applicable Escrow Funds exceeds
the aggregate amount of all Indemnification Matters recoverable from such
Escrow Funds that have been asserted but not resolved, the Indemnitees shall
seek to recover the amounts in respect of such claims from the applicable
Escrow Funds (to the extent of the applicable Escrow Funds) prior to seeking
to recover the amounts in respect of such claims under the RandW Policy or
directly from any Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnitees shall
not recover (i) any Designated Matter Damages from the General Indemnity
Funds, and (ii) any Damages other than the Designated Matter Damages from the
Special Indemnity Escrow Funds.

(b) Release of General Indemnity Escrow Funds. Within ten Business Days of the
12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "General Indemnity Escrow
Release Date"), Purchaser shall notify the Sellers' Representative in writing
of the amount (the "Release Date General Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount")
that Purchaser determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all
Indemnification Matters (other than the Designated Special Indemnification
Matters) that have been properly asserted pursuant to Section 11 on or prior
to the General Indemnity Escrow Release Date, but not resolved, on or prior to
11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the General Indemnity Escrow Release Date, it
being agreed that such amount shall include the aggregate of all Determined
Amounts with respect to all Indemnification Matters (other than the Designated
Special Indemnification Matters) that have been resolved but have not been
paid to the Indemnitee in accordance with Section 11.6(a) (each unresolved
Indemnification Matter described in this sentence, an "Unresolved General
Indemnity Escrow Claim"). Within



ten Business Days following the General Indemnity Escrow Release Date,
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds to each Seller such Seller's
Special Pro Rata Portion of the amount (if any) by which (A) the General
Indemnity Escrow Funds as of the General Indemnity Escrow Release Date exceeds
(B) the Release Date General Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount.

(c) Release of Special Indemnity Escrow Funds.

(i) Within ten Business Days of the later of 12-month anniversary of the
Closing Date and October 31, 2021 (the "First Special Indemnity Escrow Release
Date"), Purchaser shall notify the Sellers' Representative in writing of the
amount (the "First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount")
that Purchaser determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all
Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been properly asserted
pursuant to Section 11 on or prior to the First Special Indemnity Escrow
Release Date, but not resolved, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on
the First Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date, it being agreed that such
amount shall include the aggregate of all Determined Amounts with respect to
all Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been resolved but
have not been paid to the Indemnitee in accordance with Section 11.6(a) (each
unresolved Designated Special Indemnification Matter described in this
sentence, a "First Release Date Unresolved Special Indemnity Escrow Claim" and
all Determined Amounts with respect to all Designated Special Indemnification
Matters that have been resolved and paid in accordance with Section 11.6(a) on
or prior to the First Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the "First
Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Distributed Amounts"). If the sum of (A)
First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount and (B) the First
Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Distributed Amounts is less than
$500,000 (such excess of $500,000 over the sum of clauses "(A)" and "(B)" of
this sentence, the "First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Distribution
Amount"), then within ten Business Days following the First Special Indemnity
Escrow Release Date, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall execute
and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds to each Seller
such Seller's Special Pro Rata Portion of the First Release Date Special
Indemnity Escrow Distribution Amount. If, however, the sum of the amounts in
clauses "(A)" and "(B)" of the immediately foregoing sentence is more than
$500,000, no distribution from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be
made to any Seller following the First Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date.

(ii) Within ten Business Days of the 12-month anniversary of the First Special
Indemnity Escrow Release Date (the "Second Special Indemnity Escrow Release
Date"), Purchaser shall notify the Sellers' Representative in writing of the
amount (the "Second Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount")
that Purchaser determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all
Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been properly asserted
pursuant to Section 11 on or prior to the Second Special Indemnity Escrow
Release Date, but not resolved, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on
the Second Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date, it being agreed that such
amount shall include the aggregate of all Determined Amounts with respect to
all Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have



been resolved but have not been paid to the Indemnitee in accordance with
Section 11.6(a) (each unresolved Designated Special Indemnification Matter
described in this sentence, a "Second Release Date Unresolved Special
Indemnity Escrow Claim" and all Determined Amounts with respect to all
Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been resolved and paid in
accordance with Section 11.6(a) on or prior to the Second Special Indemnity
Escrow Release Date, the "Second Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Distributed Amounts"). If (A) the sum of (x) the Second Release Date Special
Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount and (y) the Second Release Date Special
Indemnity Escrow Distributed Amounts is less than $1,000,000 (such excess of
$1,000,000 over the sum of the amounts described in clauses "(A)(x)" and
"(A)(y)" of this sentence, the "Second Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Excess Amount") and (B) the Second Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Excess Amount is more than the First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Distribution Amount (such excess of Second Release Date Special Indemnity
Escrow Excess Amount over the First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Distribution Amount, the "Second Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Distribution Amount"), within ten Business Days following the Second Special
Indemnity Escrow Release Date, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds to each
Seller such Seller's Special Pro Rata Portion of the Second Release Date
Special Indemnity Escrow Distribution Amount. If, however, either the sum of
the amounts in clauses "(A)(x)" and "(A)(y)" of the immediately foregoing
sentence is more than $1,000,000 or the Second Release Date Special Indemnity
Escrow Excess Amount is less than First Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow
Distribution Amount, no distribution from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds
shall be made to any Seller following the Second Special Indemnity Escrow
Release Date.

(iii) Within ten Business Days of the 12-month anniversary of the Second
Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date (the "Final Special Indemnity Escrow
Release Date" and collectively with the General Indemnity Escrow Release Date,
the First Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date and the Second Special
Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the "Release Dates" and each, a "Release
Date"), Purchaser shall notify the Sellers' Representative in writing of the
amount (the "Final Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount")
that Purchaser determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all
Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been properly asserted
pursuant to Section 11 on or prior to the Final Special Indemnity Escrow
Release Date, but not resolved, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on
the Final Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date, it being agreed that such
amount shall include the aggregate of all Determined Amounts with respect to
all Designated Special Indemnification Matters that have been resolved but
have not been paid to the Indemnitee in accordance with Section 11.6(a) (each
unresolved Designated Special Indemnification Matter described in this
sentence, a "Final Release Date Unresolved Special Indemnity Escrow Claim,"
and collectively with the Unresolved General Indemnity Escrow Claims, the
First Release Date Unresolved Special Indemnity Escrow Claims and the Second
Release Date Unresolved Special Indemnity Escrow Claims, the "Unresolved
Claims," and each, an "Unresolved Claim"). If the Final Release Date Special
Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount is less than the funds then available in the
Special Indemnity Escrow Funds (such excess of the funds then available in the
Special Indemnity Escrow Funds over the Final Release Date Special



Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount, the "Final Release Date Special Indemnity
Escrow Distribution Amount"), within ten Business Days following the Final
Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date, Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Special
Indemnity Escrow Funds to each Seller such Seller's Special Pro Rata Portion
of the Final Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Distribution Amount. If,
however, the Final Release Date Special Indemnity Escrow Retained Amount is
more than the funds then available in the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds, no
distribution shall be made from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds to any
Seller following the Final Special Indemnity Escrow Release Date.

(d) Resolution of Unresolved Claims. If at any time after the applicable
Release Date, an Unresolved Claim is finally resolved, then Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent,
within three Business Days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Claim
and the delivery to the Indemnitee of the Determined Amount in accordance with
Section 11.6, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse from
the applicable Escrow Funds for distribution to each Seller such Seller's
Special Pro Rata Portion of the amount (if any) by which (A) the then
remaining funds in the applicable Escrow Funds that are no longer subject to
Section 11.7(b) or Section 11.7(c) exceeds (B) the aggregate amount of all
Claimed Amounts (which are not also Contested Amounts or Determined Amounts)
and Contested Amounts associated with all unresolved Indemnification Matters
recoverable from such Escrow Funds (it being agreed that such aggregate amount
shall include the aggregate of all Determined Amounts with respect to all
Indemnification Matters recoverable from such Escrow Funds that have been
resolved but have not been paid to the Indemnitee in accordance with Section
11.6).

(e) Tax Treatment. All payments to the Sellers from the Escrow Funds shall be
treated as eligible for the installment method pursuant to Section 453 of the
Code, except for the portion of such payments treated as imputed interest
pursuant to Section 483 of the Code.

11.8 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Company, 340B OpCo, PHSS, any Blocker Entity, Purchaser or any other
Person) with respect to which any Seller may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section 11, Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers' Representative. If Purchaser so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of this Section 11, Purchaser may seek
recovery of all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding (and all amounts due pursuant to any settlement, adjustment
or compromise of such claim or Legal Proceeding) as Damages;

(b) each Seller shall, to the extent legally permitted to do so, make
available to Purchaser any documents and materials in such Seller's possession
or control that may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding; provided, however, that (i) unless



otherwise required to do so by applicable court, arbitration or other legal
proceeding procedures, no Seller shall, solely by reason of this Section
11.8(b), be required to produce any such documents or materials to the extent
related to a dispute between such Seller and any Indemnitee or Purchaser or
(ii) no Seller shall be required to produce any such documents or materials to
the extent that such Seller has been advised by a reputable law firm with
offices in the United States in writing that such provision would waive or
materially impair such Seller's ability to assert attorney-client or other
legal privilege with respect to such documents and materials even with a joint
defense or common interest agreement in place; and

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim
or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Sellers' Representative or any
Seller; provided, however, that if Purchaser settles, adjusts or compromises
any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Sellers'
Representative, then such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be
conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being understood that if
Purchaser requests that the Sellers' Representative or any Seller consent to a
settlement, adjustment or compromise, neither the Sellers' Representative nor
any Seller shall unreasonably withhold, delay or condition such consent).

(d) If Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim
or Legal Proceeding, the Sellers' Representative may proceed with the defense
of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser; provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative may not settle,
adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). Purchaser shall give the Sellers' Representative
prompt notice of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against
Purchaser, the Company, 340B OpCo, PHSS or any Blocker Entity; provided,
however, that any failure on the part of Purchaser to so notify the Sellers'
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Sellers under
this Section 11 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
defense of such Legal Proceeding).

11.9 RandW Policy. Purchaser shall purchase and maintain the RandW Policy, and
shall have received as of the date hereof an executed binder for the RandW
Policy evidencing that coverage under such policy will be in effect as of the
Closing. Purchaser shall not amend, restate, supplement, modify or alter the
RandW Policy in a manner adverse to the Sellers, including in any manner that
results or could reasonably be expected to result in any incremental liability
to any Seller or any of its shareholders, officers, directors and employees
without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative, including
amending, modifying or changing the waiver of subrogation of the Sellers in
Section X.A. of the RandW Policy. Except for the portion of the premium of the
RandW Policy specifically attributable to the excess coverage pertaining to the
Fundamental Representations and the Pre-Closing Taxes, which shall be borne
50% by the Sellers, on the one hand, and 50% by Purchaser, on the other, all
other costs and expenses related



to obtaining and maintaining, and the exercise of rights under, the RandW Policy
shall be borne by Purchaser.

11.10 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Except (i) in the event of Fraud, (ii) for equitable remedies expressly
set forth in or contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) for remedies against PSG
set forth in the Indemnity Agreement and (iv) with respect to the procedures
set forth in Section 1.3, from and after the Closing, the rights to
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement set forth in this Section 11
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees with respect to any
breach of this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
Indemnitees will not have any legal recourse, remedy or other claim, whether
arising under statute, common law or otherwise, based on or with respect to
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representations, warranties or statements,
whether express or implied, made by the Company, Blocker any Seller or any of
their respective Representatives that are not expressly set forth in this
Agreement (as modified or supplemented by the Disclosure Schedule), the
Company Closing Certificate, the applicable Individual Seller Closing
Certificate, the Blocker Closing Certificate or the exhibits or schedules
hereto or thereto, whether or not such representations, warranties or
statements were made in writing or orally, including any implied warranty or
representation as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose or trade as to any of the assets of any Acquired Company or
any Blocker Entity.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates, that it has conducted an independent investigation of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, Liabilities and properties
of each Acquired Company and each of the Blocker Entities, and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Purchaser has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties regarding the Acquired
Companies and Spin-Off Entities specifically set forth in Section 2, as
modified or supplemented by the Disclosure Schedule, and the Company Closing
Certificate, the representations and warranties regarding the Sellers
specifically set forth in Section 3, as modified or supplemented by the
Disclosure Schedule, and the Individual Seller Closing Certificates and the
representations and warranties regarding the Blocker Entities set forth in
Section 4, as modified or supplemented by the Disclosure Schedule, and the
Blocker Closing Certificates, and has not relied on the accuracy or
completeness of any other information provided to (or otherwise acquired by)
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. The representations and warranties
regarding the Acquired Companies and the Spin-Off Entities specifically set
forth in Section 2, as modified or supplemented by the Disclosure Schedule,
and the Company Closing Certificate, the representations and warranties
regarding the Sellers specifically set forth in Section 3, as modified or
supplemented by the Disclosure Schedule, and the Individual Seller Closing
Certificates and the representations and warranties regarding the Blocker
Entities specifically set forth in Section 4, as modified or supplemented by
the Disclosure Schedule, and the Blocker Closing Certificate constitute the
sole and exclusive representations, warranties and statements (including by
omission) of any kind by the Company or any of its Representatives regarding
the Acquired Companies and Spin-Off Entities, by Blocker or any of its
Representatives regarding the Blocker Entities, by each Seller or any of its



Representatives regarding such Seller (and, in the case of Blocker Seller,
regarding the Blocker Entities), in each case in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all other representations, warranties
and statements (including by omission) of any kind or nature expressed or
implied in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby are
specifically disclaimed by the Acquired Companies, Blocker Entities, the
Sellers and each of their respective Representatives.

11.11 Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Purchaser. No Indemnitee (other than
Purchaser or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Purchaser (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.

11.12 Provisions Relating to the Designated Tax Matter. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement:

(a) "Designated Matter Damages" shall mean (i) all Taxes, penalties and
interest that become due and owing to any taxing authority by any Indemnitee
as a result of the Designated Tax Matter, (ii) all out-of-pocket costs
associated with income tax advisory and preparation services to assist such
Indemnitee with filing amended Tax Returns and claiming any available Tax
refunds or Tax credits as a result of the Designated Tax Matter, and (iii) any
other out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee as a result
of the Designated Tax Matter.

(b) In the event that the Designated Tax Matter results in any Taxes being
asserted against any Indemnitee, then Sellers' Representative shall establish
at its expense a program to provide information to each Indemnitee and his or
her advisor to assist such Indemnitee with filing any necessary amended Tax
Returns and claiming any available Tax refunds or Tax credits as a result of
the Designated Tax Matter.

(c) The amount of Designated Matter Damages incurred by an Indemnitee with
respect to the Designated Tax Matter shall be reduced by any Tax refunds or
Tax credits that such Indemnitee actually receives or is deemed to receive as
a result of the Designated Tax Matter, which, for the avoidance of doubt shall
include any Tax refunds received or deemed received by an Acquired Company
with respect to any Indemnitee. An Indemnitee will be deemed to receive a Tax
refund or Tax credit where there is no apparent reason why such refund would
not have been made or such credit would not have been allowed if such
Indemnitee had used commercially reasonable efforts to timely pursue such
refund or credit.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 11.3(c)(v), all Designated Matter Damages shall be
recovered by the Indemnitees from the Special Indemnity Escrow Funds;
provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnitees may recover any
such Damages that are not fully recovered from the Special Indemnity Escrow
Funds directly from the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.



12. Miscellaneous Provisions

12.1 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Appointment. Each Seller hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and
appoints the Sellers' Representative as the agent and true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of such Seller, with full power of substitution, to act in
the name, place and stead of such Seller for purposes of executing any
documents and taking, or refraining from taking, any actions that the Sellers'
Representative may, in the Sellers' Representative's sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection with this
Agreement and any other agreement, document or instrument referred to in or
contemplated by this Agreement and any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or any such other agreement, document or instrument including with
respect to, any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Section 11 or the Escrow Agreement. Charles Miller hereby accepts his
appointment as the Sellers' Representative. Purchaser shall be entitled to
deal exclusively with the Sellers' Representative on all matters relating to
this Agreement and any other agreement, document or instrument referred to in
or contemplated by this Agreement and any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or any such other agreement, document or instrument (including all
matters relating to any notice to, or any Consent to be given or action to be
taken by, any Seller) and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely conclusively
(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers'
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Seller by the Sellers' Representative, as fully binding upon
such Seller.

(b) Authority. Each of the Sellers hereby grants to the Sellers'
Representative the absolute and unrestricted right, power and authority to
execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of such Seller (in
the name of any or all of the Sellers or otherwise) any or all documents that
the Sellers' Representative may, in his sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Sellers' Representative may, in his sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing his duties as contemplated by
Section 12.1(a), including amending this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.15.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller hereby grants to
the Sellers' Representative full authority to:

(i) take all actions required by, and exercise all rights granted to, the
Sellers' Representative in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument delivered by any Seller or the Sellers' Representative
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) receive all notices or other documents given or to be given to such
Seller by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement or instrument delivered by any Seller or the Sellers'
Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iii) negotiate, undertake, compromise, defend, resolve and settle any suit,
proceeding or dispute on behalf of such Seller under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or



any other agreement or instrument delivered by any Seller or the Sellers'
Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with
the terms herein;

(iv) to retain $4,000,000 (the "Sellers' Representative Amount") of the
Purchase Price as a reserve against Liabilities incurred by the Sellers or
Sellers' Representative in his capacity as the Sellers' Representative (the
"Sellers' Representative Fund") in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and as otherwise set forth in Section
12.1(f);

(v) execute and deliver all agreements, certificates and documents required or
deemed appropriate by the Sellers' Representative in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any
other agreement or instrument delivered by any Seller or the Sellers'
Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

(vi) take such other action as the Sellers' Representative may deem necessary
or appropriate to carry out the intents and purposes of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any other agreement or instrument delivered by any Seller
or the Sellers' Representative in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any
other agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Sellers' Representative on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 11 or under the
Escrow Agreement.

(c) Power of Attorney. The Sellers recognize and intend that the power of
attorney granted in Section 12.1(a): (i) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers' Representative; and (iii)
shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
each of the Sellers.

(d) Replacement. If the Sellers' Representative shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, the
Sellers shall within ten days after such death, resignation or disability or
inability, appoint a successor to the Sellers' Representative (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) and immediately thereafter notify
Purchaser of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed
the Sellers' Representative as Sellers' Representative hereunder. If for any
reason there is no Sellers' Representative at any time, all references herein
to the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers.

(e) No Liability. Under no circumstances shall Sellers' Representative be
liable to any Seller in its capacity as Sellers' Representative other than in
the case of Fraud or willful misconduct.



(f) Sellers' Representative Fund. The Sellers' Representative Fund shall be
held by the Sellers' Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Sellers and shall be used for the purposes of (i) paying directly or
reimbursing the Sellers' Representative for any fees or expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any applicable
Sellers' Representative letter agreement, (ii) paying certain specified
Damages in accordance with Section 11 (at the discretion of the Sellers'
Representative), (iii) paying any other amounts provided for by agreement
among the Sellers, and (iv) otherwise satisfying certain Liabilities incurred
by the Sellers or the Sellers' Representative in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. As soon as reasonably
determined by the Sellers' Representative that the Sellers' Representative
Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the Sellers' Representative shall
distribute the then remaining amount of the Sellers' Representative Fund, if
any, to the Sellers based on their respective Special Pro Rata Portions.

12.2 Further Assurances. Each Party shall execute and cause to be delivered to
each other Party such instruments and other documents, and shall take and
cause to be taken such other actions, as such other Party may reasonably
request (at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.3 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 1.3(d), Section 7.1(a), Section 11,
Section 12.4 and the Escrow Agreement, each Party shall bear and pay all fees,
costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in the future
by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with or by virtue of: (a) the negotiation, preparation and review
of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements,
certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(b) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be made
or given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in
connection with any of such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.4 Taxes.

(a) Tax Returns.

(i) Tax Return Filings by Sellers.

(A) The Sellers shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) all flow-through income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
all Tax Returns of the Spin-Off Entities for any Tax period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date and any Straddle Period. The Sellers shall file when due
all other Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies that are due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) on or prior to the Closing Date.
Blocker Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) all income Tax Returns of Blocker and the
BWA Entities for tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date.



(B) In each case, the Sellers (or, in the case of Blocker or the BWA Entities,
Blocker Seller) shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Returns, excluding the amounts of any Taxes included as a
liability in Net Working Capital or Indebtedness (but only to the extent that
such inclusion actually reduces the Closing Purchase Price). All Tax Returns
that Sellers and Blocker Seller are required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this Section 12.4(a)(i) shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position
shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions, elections or
methods that would have the effect of deferring income to periods ending after
the Closing Date or accelerating deductions to periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements). The
Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller, as applicable, shall submit a draft
copy of any Tax Return that Sellers or Blocker Seller are required to file or
cause to be filed in accordance with this Section 12.4(a)(i) to Purchaser, no
later than 30 Business Days in the case of any income Tax Return, or within a
reasonable amount of time (but in no event later than 15 Business Days in the
case of any other Tax Return), prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return, for its review. Such Tax Returns shall not be filed without the
consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller, as
applicable, shall consider in good faith any comments of Purchaser regarding
such Tax Returns that are delivered in writing to the Sellers' Representative
or Blocker Seller, as applicable, no later than 15 Business Days in the case
of any income Tax Return, or no later than ten Business Days in the case of
any other Tax Return after receipt by Purchaser of the applicable Tax Return,
and in the event that Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative or Blocker
Seller, as applicable, cannot resolve any disputed item, Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller, as applicable, shall cause the item
in question to be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.3(c) (to the extent applicable), which
resolution shall be binding on the Parties.

(C) Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, the Texas franchise tax
return that will be filed in 2020 for the privilege of doing business in Texas
during 2020 (the "Texas 2020 Return") will be filed by Sellers' Representative
regardless of whether such Tax Return is filed on, before or after the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, such Tax Return shall be treated in this
Agreement as a Tax Return for a Straddle Period.

(ii) Tax Return Filings by Purchaser.

(A) Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies, Blocker or the BWA
Entities, other than those described in Section 12.4(a)(i), including for the
avoidance of doubt the U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies and the Blocker Entities for a Straddle Period; provided,
however, that for purposes of the provisions of this Section 12.4 (other than
Section 12.4(a)(i)), the term "Acquired Companies" shall refer only to the
Company, 340B OpCo and PHSS and shall not refer to any of the Spin-Off
Entities for the period after the Spin-Off except where stated otherwise.



(B) Any Tax Return that Purchaser is required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this Section 12.4(a)(ii) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Straddle Period) shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax
Returns in prior periods (including elections or methods that would have the
effect of accelerating income to periods ending before the Closing Date or
deferring deductions to periods ending on or after the Closing Date) except to
the extent that Purchaser determines is required by applicable Legal
Requirements; provided, that, notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, the federal partnership income Tax Return of the Company for a
Straddle Period and any conforming state and local income Tax Returns for a
Straddle Period shall comply with the requirements set forth in Schedule
12.4(a)(ii)(B), to the extent applicable in the case of such state and local
income Tax Returns. Purchaser shall submit a draft copy of any such Tax Return
for a Straddle Period to the Sellers' Representative or, in the case of any
such Tax Return relating to Blocker or any BWA Entity, to Blocker Seller, no
later than 30 Business Days in the case of any income Tax Return, or within a
reasonable amount of time (but in no event later than 15 Business Days) in the
case of any other Tax Return, prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return, for its review and consent prior to filing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser's submission of the
draft Tax Return for the Straddle Period shall include a workpaper (and
necessary supporting data) that provides for the allocation of items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit between the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion ending after the Closing
Date as determined applying the principles set forth in Section 11.2(a)(iv);
Purchaser shall consider in good faith any comments of the Sellers'
Representative or Blocker Seller, as applicable, regarding such Tax Returns
that are delivered in writing to Purchaser no later than 15 Business Days in
the case of any income Tax Return, or no later than 10 Business Days in the
case of any other Tax Return, after receipt by the Sellers' Representative or
Blocker Seller, as applicable, of the applicable Tax Return, and in the event
that Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller, as
applicable, cannot resolve any disputed item, Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative or Blocker Seller, as applicable, shall cause the item in
question to be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.3(c) (to the extent applicable), which
resolution shall be binding on the Parties. The Sellers or Blocker Seller, as
applicable, shall remit or cause to be remitted the excess, if any, of (A) the
amount of Taxes on such Tax Returns relating to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined, under Section 11.2(a)(iv)),
over (B) the amount of Taxes paid by the Acquired Companies (including the
Spin-Off Entities) on or before the Closing Date in respect of such Straddle
Period or otherwise included in the determination of the Closing Purchase
Price and, if the amount in clause (B) (determined by excluding any Taxes
attributable to the Spin-Off Entities) shall exceed the amount described in
clause (A) above, Purchaser shall promptly pay the amount of such excess to
the Sellers\' Representative for the benefit of the Sellers or Blocker Seller,
as applicable. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of
Blocker Seller, the amount of Taxes relating to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall include the Tax liability that each of
BWA Common and BWA Preferred would have as determined pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi). For the avoidance of doubt, neither
Purchaser, the Acquired



Companies nor the Blocker Entities shall be liable for any Taxes of the Spin-
Off Entities whether incurred before or after the Closing.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
claimed on the U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and non-U.S.) Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies (including the Spin-Off Entities), Blocker
and the BWA Entities for the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, as
applicable, except where to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Legal
Requirements.

(b) This Section 12.4(b) rather than Section 11.8 shall control with respect
to any Tax Proceeding. As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax Proceeding"
shall mean any pending or threatened audit, examination or other
administrative or judicial proceeding, contest, assessment, notice of
deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment that relates to either
(i) any and all Taxes of the Company, an Acquired Company (including the Spin-
Off Entities), Blocker or any BWA Entity, or flow through income Tax Returns
with respect to a tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, as
applicable, or (ii) to the extent not referred to in clause "(i)" of this
sentence, the Designated Tax Matter. Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Sellers' Representative (or, in the case of a Tax Proceeding relating to
Blocker or a BWA Entity, Blocker Seller) in writing upon receipt by Purchaser,
the Company, an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entity of written notice
of any Tax Proceeding. The Sellers' Representative shall assume control and be
responsible for any Tax Proceeding relating solely to a Spin-Off Entity and
shall be responsible for any Taxes in accordance with, but subject to any
applicable limitations of, Section 11 arising from such Tax Proceeding. The
Sellers' Representative shall assume control and be responsible for any Tax
Proceeding relating solely to a Special Tax Indemnity Matter and shall be
responsible for any Taxes (and in the case of any Designated Tax Matter, any
Designated Matter Damages) in accordance with, but subject to any applicable
limitations of, Section 11, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section
11.12; provided, that, Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any
such Tax Proceeding at its expense through its own counsel. The Sellers'
Representative (or, in the case of a Tax Proceeding relating to Blocker or a
BWA Entity, Blocker Seller) shall have, in its discretion, the right to assume
control and defend at its expense any Tax Proceeding not relating to a Spin-
Off Entity or a Special Tax Indemnity Matter by providing written notice to
Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from Purchaser;
provided, that, Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding at its expense through its own counsel. The Sellers' Representative
(or, in the case of a Tax Proceeding relating to Blocker or a BWA Entity,
Blocker Seller) may settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding in its
discretion; provided, that, if any such settlement or compromise would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Company, an
Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entity, as the case may be, for a Tax
period ending after the Closing Date, the Sellers' Representative or Blocker
Seller, as applicable, shall not settle or compromise such Tax Proceeding
without the written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall take all
reasonable actions requested by the Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller,
as applicable, to permit the Sellers or Blocker Seller, as applicable, to
control and defend such Tax Proceeding (including, at Purchaser's election,
either by providing a limited power of attorney or by participating in such
Tax Proceeding). Any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period of the



Acquired Companies or to any other Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies or
Blocker required to be filed by Purchaser shall be controlled by Purchaser;
provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller, as
applicable, shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding,
including through separate counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and
expense and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Sellers' Representative or Blocker Seller with such participation rights,
provided, that, Purchaser shall, after consultation with Sellers'
Representative (or Blocker Seller, as the case may be), have the right to
control such Tax Proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers'
Representative shall control any Tax Proceeding relating to the Texas 2020
Return and Purchaser shall have such participation rights. Where a party has
participation rights pursuant to this Section 12.4(b), such rights shall
include (i) the right to receive reasonable advance notice of any meetings,
hearings or proceedings, and (ii) the right to review in advance and comment
on any pleadings, briefs or other documents to be filed. Purchaser shall not
enter into any settlement or compromise for any such Tax Proceeding described
in the second and third preceding sentence without the Sellers'
Representative's or Blocker Seller, as applicable, consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance
of doubt, the exercise of participation rights by Purchaser through counsel at
Purchaser's expense shall not eliminate or modify any right of Purchaser or
any other Indemnitee to assert Damages consisting of attorneys' fees or other
expenses as the result of any Tax Proceeding for which Purchaser or such other
Indemnitee reasonably incurs expenses on account of being made a party to such
Tax Proceeding prior to Sellers' Representative's assumption of control with
respect to such Tax Proceeding.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the Parties agree (i) that 70% of success-
based fees paid by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deductible under Rev. Proc. 2011-29 and (ii) all
Transaction Expenses shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (which
for the avoidance doubt shall include Change of Control Bonus of the
Continuing Employee Change of Control Bonus Recipient) for purposes of
preparing the Tax Returns of the Company, Blocker and the BWA Entities to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements (provided, that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's own expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein shall be allocated to tax periods in
accordance with Purchaser's practices and requirements). Without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative (or, in the case of any actions
described in this sentence relating to Blocker or the BWA Entities, Blocker
Seller), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (it being agreed that any refusal to consent to any actions described
below relating to any matter described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of Schedule
11.2(a)(vi) or to the Historic Treatment shall not be considered
unreasonable), Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates, an
Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entities, to (1) file any Tax Return for
an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
other than in accordance with Section 12.4(a) and this Section 12.4(c), (2)
amend any Tax Return for an Acquired Company (or file an administrative
adjustment request with respect to the Company under Section 6227 of the Code
(and any comparable provision of state or local law, if applicable)), Blocker
or any BWA Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including the Company 2020
Federal Return as to any matter specified in Schedule 12.4(a)(ii)(B), (3) make
or change any Tax election that applies or is retroactive to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or take any



other action after the Closing that could reasonably be expected to result in
any increased Tax Liability for any Seller, an Acquired Company, Blocker or
any BWA Entity with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (4) file any Tax
Return for an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entity for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period in any jurisdiction where, prior to the date hereof, the Acquired
Company, Blocker or such BWA Entity, as the case may be, has not filed such
type of Tax Return, (5) agree to extend the statute of limitations with
respect to: (A) any assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for Blocker, any BWA Entity or any Acquired Company; or (B)
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that could result in an imputed underpayment (as
that term is defined in Section 6225 of the Code) for an Acquired Company or
BWA Feeder, (6) compromise or settle any Tax Liability for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period other than in accordance with this Section 12.4(c), or (7) initiate any
voluntary contact with a taxing authority regarding any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, including the Company 2020 Federal Return as to any matter specified
in Schedule 12.4(a)(ii)(B); provided, that, the written consent of Sellers'
Representative (or, in the case of any actions described in this sentence
relating to Blocker or the BWA Entities, Blocker Seller), shall not be
required with respect to any Straddle Period where the action taken would not
affect the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. For the
portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than transactions
expressly contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies,
Blocker and the BWA Entities to carry on their respective businesses only in
the Ordinary Course of Business.

(d) The Parties agree to cause the Company to make an election under Section
754 of the Code (and any similar provision of applicable state, local or
non-U.S. Tax laws) for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the Parties
understand and agree that in the event of any audit of the Company after the
Closing Date resulting in an adjustment under Section 6225 of the Code where
the reviewed year (as defined in Section 6225(d) of the Code) is or includes a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Company's "partnership representative" (as defined
in Section 6223 of the Code) for such Tax period shall cause the Company to
elect under Section 6226 of the Code to push such adjustment out to the
members of the Company so that such members and not the Company are liable for
any Tax attributable to such adjustment.

(f) Any income Tax refunds of BWA Preferred Corp. or BWA Common Corp.
attributable to carrybacks of net operating losses arising in any tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or overpayments of estimated taxes with
respect to 2019 that are received by Purchaser, an Acquired Company, Blocker
or any BWA Entity, and any amounts credited against Tax (in lieu of receiving
such a refund) to which Purchaser, an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA
Entity become entitled, shall be for the account of Blocker Seller. Purchaser
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, any such refund, or the amount of any
such credit, that is for the account of Blocker Seller in accordance with and
to the extent provided in the preceding sentence by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by Blocker
Seller prior to such payment. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company,
Blocker and each BWA Entity, to cooperate with Blocker Seller (including by
filing amended Tax Returns and filing any claim for refund (including IRS Form



1139 or IRS Form 4466) or amended Tax Returns prepared by Blocker Seller and
approved by Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to effect a carryback of any net operating loss of BWA
Common Corp. or BWA Preferred Corp. for the tax period ending on the Closing
Date to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements), to
obtain any refunds or credits that would result in a payment to Blocker Seller
under this Section 12.4(f); provided, that, Blocker Seller shall reimburse
Purchaser for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in preparing and
filing such amended Tax Returns and claims for refund. Blocker Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly participate in any conferences or proceedings relating
to such amended Tax Returns and claims for refund. If there is any contest
relating to such refund claims, Blocker Seller shall determine the arguments
to be made in such contest after considering in good faith the views of
Purchaser, provided, that, if any such argument is objected to by Purchaser on
the ground that it would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the Company, an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA Entity, as the
case may be, for a Tax period ending after the Closing Date (other than by
reducing any net operating loss carryforward available in any such period),
then neither Blocker Seller nor its representative shall assert such argument.
Neither Purchaser, BWA Common Corp. or BWA Preferred Corp. nor any of their
Affiliates shall elect to waive any carryback of net operating losses under
Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local or
foreign Legal Requirements) on any Tax Return of BWA Common Corp. or BWA
Preferred Corp. for any Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date. In
the event that Purchaser, the Company, an Acquired Company, Blocker or any BWA
Entity is required to pay to the applicable taxing authority any amount that
has been paid to Blocker Seller pursuant to this Section 12.4(f), then Blocker
Seller shall pay such amount to Purchaser immediately after receiving notice
from Purchaser.

(g) Blocker Seller and Purchaser shall, with respect to U.S. federal income
tax returns pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b), and with
respect to all other Tax Returns, unless prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirements, close the taxable period of the Blocker and each BWA Entity
(other than BWA Feeder) as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If
applicable Legal Requirements do not permit the Blocker or any BWA Entity, as
the case may be, to close its respective taxable year on the Closing Date or
in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a Straddle Period, the
Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated as
provided in Section 11.2(c)(iv).

(h) Purchaser, each Acquired Company, Blocker, each of the BWA Entities,
Blocker Seller and the Sellers' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 12.4 and any Tax Proceeding.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, including
Purchaser and Acquired Company providing records and information reasonably
necessary for Sellers' Representative to satisfy its obligations under Section
11.2. Each Acquired Company, each Spin-Off Entity, Blocker and each of the BWA
Entities shall (1) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to such Acquired Company,



Spin-Off Entity, Blocker and such BWA Entity relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser, the Sellers'
Representative, an Acquired Company, a Spin-Off Entity, Blocker or any BWA
Entity, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (2) give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying, or discarding of any such books and records and, if

cooperate with each other to reduce any Transfer Taxes payable in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
Purchaser is required to make any payment to Sellers' Representative or
Blocker Seller pursuant to this Section 12.4, then Purchaser may, at its

Representative and/or Blocker Seller, as the case may be.

ratable allocation election in Treasury Regulation Section

12.7 Time of the Essence. For the purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, time is of the essence with
respect to all dates and time periods.

12.8 Headings. The bold-faced headings and the underlined headings contained
in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed
to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.9 Counterparts and Exchanges by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may
be executed in several counterparts (including by means of electronic
transmission in portable document format (pdf)), each of which shall
constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
one agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered
into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto,
to the extent delivered by means of e-mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the reasonable request of any Party or to any such agreement or instrument,
each other Party will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other Parties. No Party or to any such agreement or instrument will raise
the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such Party waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
related to lack of authenticity.

12.10 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether
in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement) shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects
by, the laws of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws principles
thereof.

(b) Venue. Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement or in Section
12.10(c), any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of any



provision of this Agreement (including a Legal Proceeding based upon Fraud or
breach of a covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement) shall be
brought or otherwise commenced exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the Legal Proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal
courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the District of Delaware (collectively, the "Chosen
Courts"). Each Party: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to
the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding; (ii) agrees that each Chosen Courts shall be deemed to be a
convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such Legal Proceeding commenced in any Chosen
Court, any claim that such Party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of such court, that such Legal Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or
the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

(c) Indemnification Claims. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 11 shall be brought and resolved exclusively
in accordance with Section 11.5 (it being understood that, for the avoidance
of doubt and without limiting any portion of Section 12.10(b); (i) any claim
or Legal Proceeding based upon Fraud or for breach of a covenant or obligation
set forth in this Agreement may only and exclusively be brought and resolved
in a Chosen Court rather than in accordance with Section 11.5; and (ii)
nothing in this Section 12.10(c) shall prevent any Indemnitee from seeking
preliminary injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy from a Chosen
Court).

12.11 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon each of the
Parties and each of their respective heirs, estates, executors and personal
representatives and successors and permitted assigns, if any. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of: the Sellers, Purchaser, the other Indemnitees
and the respective heirs, estates, executors and personal representatives and
successors and permitted assigns (if any) of the foregoing. Purchaser may
freely assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement (including its
indemnification rights under Section 11), in whole or in part, to any other
Person without obtaining the consent or approval of any other Party or of any
other Person. No Seller shall be permitted to assign any of such Seller's
rights or delegate any of such Seller's obligations under this Agreement
without Purchaser's prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or
delegation by any Seller in violation of this Section 12.11 shall be null and
void.

12.12 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement and without limiting the terms of Section 11, the rights and
remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements
and covenants hereunder, including such Party's failure to take all actions as
are necessary on such Party's part in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will
cause irreparable injury to the other Parties, for which Damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by



any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such Party's
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of such Party's obligations hereunder.

12.13 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.

12.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 12.14.

12.15 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (acting
exclusively for and on behalf of all of the Sellers).

12.16 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, shall
be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful,
void or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable,
shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.



12.17 Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Section 11, none of
the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies
to any Person other than the Parties, the Indemnitees and their respective
successors and assigns (if any).

12.18 Confidential Nature of Information. Each Seller agrees that he, she or
it will, and will cause his, her or its Affiliates and employees, agents and
other Representatives to, treat in confidence (i) all documents, materials and
other written or oral information which he, she or it shall have obtained at
any time regarding Purchaser or its Affiliates, (ii) all documents, materials
and other written or oral information which he, she or it shall have obtained
at any time regarding the Company, 340B OpCo, PHSS, any Blocker Entity or the
Retained Business and (iii) all documents, materials and other written or oral
information which he, she or it shall have obtained at any time regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the existence and terms
of this Agreement and all the other agreements referred to in this Agreement),
and not use any such documents, materials and other written or oral
information for any purpose other than as specified in this Agreement;
provided, however, the obligation of each Seller to treat such documents,
materials and other written or oral information in confidence and not to use
any such documents, materials and other written or oral information for any
purpose other than as specified in this Agreement shall not apply to any
information which (a) is or becomes available to the public other than as a
result of any act or failure to act by such Seller or any of his, her or its
Affiliates or their employees, agents and other Representatives or (b) is
required to be disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, but only
that portion of such information which it is advised by counsel in writing is
legally required to be disclosed; provided, that such Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser in writing of such requirement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 12.18
shall prevent a Seller from disclosing any relevant information, documents or
materials to the extent reasonably required in any dispute with Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or any Indemnitee; provided that reasonable efforts are
made to maintain the confidentiality of such information, documents or
materials.

12.19 No Public Announcement. Prior to the Closing, neither Purchaser, any
Seller, Sellers' Representative, Blocker nor the Company (nor any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives) shall, without the approval of each
other Party, make any press release or other public announcement concerning
this Agreement (including the terms and the existence of this Agreement) or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent
that any Party shall be so obligated by law, in which case such Party shall
first advise each other Party thereof and the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be
issued; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude
communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this
Agreement; and provided, further, that Purchaser may issue a press release
announcing the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with the
execution of this Agreement. Following the Closing, none of the Sellers, nor
the Sellers' Representative nor any of their Affiliates or Representatives
shall make any press release or other public announcement concerning this
Agreement (including the terms and the existence of this Agreement) or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
such Party shall be so obligated



by law, in which case such Party shall advise Purchaser thereof and the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued.

12.20 Legal Representation. Each of the Parties acknowledges that Norton Rose
Fulbright US LLP ("Norton Rose Fulbright") currently serves as counsel to each
of (i) the Company, (ii) Blocker and (iii) the Class A Holder, including in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. There
may come a time, including after the Closing, when the interests of the Class
A Holder, the Company and Blocker may no longer be aligned or when, for any
reason, the Class A Holder, Norton Rose Fulbright, the Company or Blocker
believe that Norton Rose Fulbright cannot or should no longer represent each
of the Class A Holder, the Company and Blocker. The Parties understand and
specifically agree that Norton Rose Fulbright may withdraw from representing
the Company and/or Blocker, as the case may be, and continue to represent the
Class A Holder, even if the interests of the Class A Holder, and the interests
of the Company and/or Blocker, as the case may be, are or may be adverse,
including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and even though Norton Rose
Fulbright may have represented the Company or Blocker in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Company, Blocker or any of their respective Affiliates, and Purchaser, the
Company and Blocker hereby consent thereto and waive any conflict of interest
arising therefrom. Each of the Parties agrees that, as to all communications
among Norton Rose Fulbright, the Class A Holder and Holland and Knight LLP, as
counsel to Blocker Seller ("Holland and Knight"), related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and not involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Blocker Entities, the attorney-client privilege,
the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege belong to the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, and
shall not pass to or be claimed by the Company, any Acquired Company or any
Blocker Entity. As to any communications between Norton Rose Fulbright, the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Blocker Entities and Holland and Knight prior
to the Closing (collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), Purchaser, the
Company and Blocker, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, agree that no such Person may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of
the Sellers after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any communications between Holland and Knight and Blocker Seller or
any of its Affiliates shall be attorney-client confidences that belong solely
to the Blocker Seller. Recognizing that Holland and Knight has acted as legal
counsel to Blocker Seller and the Blocker Entities prior to the Closing, and
that Holland and Knight intends to act as legal counsel to Blocker Seller and
certain of their Affiliates after the Closing, Purchaser hereby waives, on its
own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Holland and Knight's representing Blocker Seller and/or
their Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Purchaser or the transactions contemplated herein (including in respect of
litigation).

12.21 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein (including the Disclosure Schedule) set forth the entire understanding
of the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior agreements and



understandings among or between any of the Parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, effective
as of the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 14, 2020
between PSG and Purchaser shall be terminated and shall be null and void and
of no force or effect.

12.22 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the
particular representation or warranty of the Company, the Sellers or Blocker,
as applicable, set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section or
subsection of this Agreement, except to the extent that (a) such information
is explicitly cross-referenced in another part of the Disclosure Schedule or
(b) it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure (without reference
to any document referred to therein) that such information qualifies another
representation and warranty of the Company, the Sellers or Blocker, as
applicable, in this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule may not be amended or
modified after the execution of this Agreement.

12.23 Mutual Drafting. The Parties are sophisticated and have been represented
by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who have
carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the Parties do
not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

12.24 Construction.

(a) Gender; Etc. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

(b) Interpretation. As used in this Agreement: (i) the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation"; (ii) the use of the word "or" shall not be exclusive; (iii) the
phrase "substantially in the form attached hereto" and any variations thereof
shall be deemed to mean in such form attached hereto subject to immaterial
changes; and (iv) the words "written" and "in writing" include communications
delivered electronically.

(c) References. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.

(d) Currency. All references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$"shall mean
United States Dollars.
