AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 30, 2015 (this
"Agreement"), is by and between Great Western Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("GWBI"), and HF Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company") (GWBI and Company being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Constituent Corporations").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of GWBI and Company have approved
and declared advisable the merger of Company with and into GWBI, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Company ("Company
Common Stock") not owned directly or indirectly by GWBI or Company will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter
defined);

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of GWBI and Company have
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective long-term business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective stockholders;

WHEREAS, in order to induce GWBI to enter into this Agreement, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the stockholders of Company
listed on Exhibit C are entering into agreements (the "Stockholder Voting
Agreements"), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant
to which, among other things, each such Person has agreed to vote in favor of
this Agreement and the Merger;

WHEREAS, GWBI owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of Great Western Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the State of South
Dakota ("GWBI Bank") and Company owns all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of Home Federal Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the
State of South Dakota (the "Company Bank"); and

WHEREAS, as part of the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties wish to
provide for the merger of Company Bank with and into GWBI Bank.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER AND RELATED MATTERS

Section 1.1 The Merger. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"),
Company shall be merged with and into GWBI (the "Merger") at the Effective
Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Company shall cease and GWBI shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Company in accordance with the DGCL.

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in
Subchapter IX of the DGCL.

(c) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of GWBI, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(the "GWBI Certificate of Incorporation"), shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
GWBI, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) The directors and officers of GWBI at the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then-current director of Company shall submit to Company his or her
written resignation as a director.

Section 1.2 Bank Merger. At Closing, GWBI Bank and Company Bank shall enter
into the Bank Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "Bank Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the Bank Merger
Agreement, immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger (i) Company
Bank will be merged with and into GWBI Bank (the "Bank Merger"), (ii) the
separate corporate existence of Company Bank will cease and (iii) GWBI Bank
will continue as the surviving corporation in the Bank Merger and will succeed
to and assume all the rights and obligations of Company Bank, in each case as
provided in the Bank Merger Agreement.

Section 1.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective when the
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, upon mutual consent of the
Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later
date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days after the date the
Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term
"Effective Time" shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of
Merger is accepted for recording or such later time established by the 

Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made
on the date of the Closing, or as soon as practicable thereafter.

Section 1.4 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of GWBI, Company or the holders of
any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

(a) Each share of GWBI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of
Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by GWBI or any wholly owned Subsidiary of GWBI
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and neither the Merger
Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor (the "Company Cancelled Shares").

(c) (i) Subject to Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.4(c)(iii), each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Company Cancelled Shares and shares of Company Common Stock that
constitute Dissenting Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive the
following, without interest:

1.$19.50 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") for each share of Company Common
Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a "Cash Election")
has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to
Section 1.6 (collectively, the "Cash Election Shares");

2.0.65 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of GWBI Common Stock (the "Stock
Consideration") for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which
an election to receive GWBI Common Stock (a "Stock Election") has been
effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 1.6
(collectively, the "Stock Election Shares"); and

3.for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash
Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to Section 1.6 (collectively, the "Non-Election
Shares"), the right to receive such Cash Consideration or Stock Consideration
as determined in accordance with Section 1.5.

(ii) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration (as applicable, the
"Merger Consideration") pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, an "Old Certificate," it being
understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock 

held in book entry form) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
(i) the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with,
and subject to, Sections 1.4(c)(i), 1.5 and 1.6, (ii) as provided in Section
1.4(c)(iii), cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(ii), without any interest
thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(b). Old Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for evidence of
shares in book entry form or, at GWBI's option, certificates (collectively
referred to herein as "New Certificates"), representing the Stock
Consideration (together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor) or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, upon the surrender of such
Old Certificates in accordance with Section 1.8, without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of GWBI Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into
or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any
such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of GWBI Common Stock
shall not be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to GWBI Common Stock shall be payable on
or with respect to any such fractional share interest, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of GWBI. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, GWBI shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock
who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of GWBI Common
Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(i) and
subject to Section 1.5, and (ii) the GWBI Closing Price. As used herein, "GWBI
Closing Price" shall mean the average closing price of GWBI Common Stock on
the NYSE for the ten (10) full trading days ending on the third Business Day
preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share
interest, all shares of Company Common Stock owned by a Company stockholder
shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of
GWBI Common Stock issuable to such Company stockholder.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock the holder of which has perfected
appraisal rights under the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger 

Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. Company shall give GWBI prompt notice upon
receipt by Company of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such
shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other
instruments provided pursuant to Applicable Law (any stockholder duly making
such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder"), and GWBI
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of GWBI, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by
such Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights
under the DGCL. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be
made by the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder's right to payment for Dissenting Shares after the Effective Time, each
share of Company Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without interest thereon in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(i)
and treated as Non-Election Shares for purposes of Section 1.5.

(d) Company Options. Each outstanding option for Company Common Stock shall be
exercised prior to the Effective Date and the shares of Company Common Stock
issued upon exercise shall be eligible to receive the Merger Consideration.

(e) Stock Appreciation Rights. Each outstanding stock appreciation right for
Company Common Stock shall be settled in Company Common Stock prior to the
Closing Date, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be eligible to
receive the Merger Consideration.

Section 1.5 Proration of Merger Consideration.

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Stock Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(i) shall be equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) of (i) 0.75 and (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, but excluding Company Cancelled Shares and shares of Company Common
Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares (the "Stock Conversion Number"). All
other shares of Company Common Stock, but excluding Company Cancelled Share
and shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

(b)Promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, GWBI shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Cash Consideration as follows: 

(i)If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number")
exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration only in respect of
that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Stock Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and

(ii)If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the
amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number
being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the
following manner:

(A)If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions
of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration; or

(B)If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Cash Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with Section 1.5(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares
shall be 

rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

Section 1.6 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Sections
1.4(c)(i) and 1.5 (a "Holder") shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article I, to submit an election in accordance
with the following procedures:

(a)Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 1.6 (herein called an "Election") (i) the number of whole
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of whole shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election. A Holder who holds shares of Company Common
stock as nominee, trustee or in another representative capacity may submit
multiple Election Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such representative for a particular
beneficial owner.

(b)GWBI shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Company, including
appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as prepared by
GWBI and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Election Form"), so as to
permit the Holders to exercise their right to make an Election.

(c)GWBI (i) shall initially make available and mail the Election Form not less
than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline, or
on such other date as the parties may agree, to Holders of record as of two
(2) Business Days prior to such mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing
date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as
possible a Election Form to any Holder who requests such Election Form prior
to the Election Deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the
Election Deadline is referred to herein as the "Election Period".

(d)Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall
have received, during the Election Period, an Election Form properly completed
and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the
Election Form) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing all
certificated shares to which such Election Form relates or by an appropriate
customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set forth in such
Election Form, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or
a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used herein,
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "Election Deadline" means
5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the
Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the parties shall agree is as
near as practicable to three (3) Business Days preceding the Closing Date. The
parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than
fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days 

prior to, the Election Deadline. Any shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which the Holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline,
have made an Election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective,
properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares.

(e)Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised
Election Form. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock (none of GWBI, Company nor the Exchange Agent being
under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall
be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election
Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

(f)Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or
her Old Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old
Certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections
shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(g)Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Election Form, GWBI, in the
exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of the Election Forms and compliance by any Holder
with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the method of issuance and
delivery of New Certificates representing the whole number of shares of GWBI
Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted, and
(iii) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of GWBI Common Stock.

Section 1.7 GWBI to Make Merger Consideration Available. After the Election
Deadline and no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
GWBI shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by GWBI and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 1.7, (a) New Certificates representing the
aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(i) and
exchanged pursuant to Section 1.8(a), and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to
pay (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New
Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in
the Exchange 

Fund as directed by GWBI, provided that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old
Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to GWBI. Company agrees that ComputerShare, Limited shall act as
the Exchange Agent in connection with the Merger.

Section 1.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days thereafter, GWBI shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration and that has not theretofore submitted its Old
Certificates with an Election Form, a letter of transmittal ("Letter of
Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Stock
Consideration and/or the Cash Consideration which such holder shall have
become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Sections
1.4(c)(i), 1.5 and 1.6, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to Section 1.8(b). A Letter of Transmittal shall be deemed properly completed
with respect to a holder of Company Common Stock only if accompanied by one or
more Old Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding a
loss or destruction of such Old Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of
such Old Certificates) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such Letter of Transmittal. From and after the Effective Time and the
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.5, upon proper
surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
Letter of Transmittal or Election Form, as applicable, duly executed, the
holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate
representing the Stock Consideration to which such holder of Company Common
Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject
to, Sections 1.4(c)(i), 1.5 and 1.6 and/or (ii) a check representing the
amount of (A) the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates in
accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.4(c)(i), 1.5 and 1.6, (B) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to
Section 1.4(c)(iii) and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(b), and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal, the Exchange Agent
shall have discretion to determine whether any Letter of Transmittal has been
properly 

completed and any Old Certificates properly surrendered or exchanged
hereunder. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8(a), each Old
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to GWBI Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with the
exchange provisions of this Agreement. After the surrender of an Old
Certificate, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the Stock Consideration which
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive.

(c)Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders. If the Person surrendering
an Old Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal is not
the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment of the
Merger Consideration that: (i) such Old Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Old
Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied
by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Old
Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the
record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Old
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(d)Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 1.8(d).

(e)Return of Exchange Fund. At any time following the six (6) month period
after the Effective Time, GWBI shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent
to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Old
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to GWBI (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Old Certificates
held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither GWBI nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of an Old Certificate for any Merger 

Consideration properly delivered in respect of such Old Certificates to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law.

(f)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Old Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by GWBI, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as GWBI may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

(g)Reservation of Shares. GWBI shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number
of shares of the GWBI Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of GWBI
Common Stock in accordance with this Article 1.

Section 1.9 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, GWBI and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange
Agent, GWBI or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and paid over to
the appropriate governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, GWBI or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 1.10 Tax Treatment of the Merger. It is intended by the parties that
the Merger constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the Treasury Regulations. All of the parties agree to cooperate and use their
best efforts in order to qualify the transactions contemplated herein as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and to report the
Merger for federal, state and any local income Tax purposes in a manner
consistent with such characterization.

Section 1.11 Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either
of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and
directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on 

behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of
either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, the Surviving Corporation's right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets
of such Constituent Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

to do business, and are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of their properties owned or held under lease or the nature of their
activities makes such qualification or good standing necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on GWBI.

Section 2.2 Authority.

has determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interest of

this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of GWBI
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent its
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law).

registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic

hereby by GWBI or GWBI Bank.

institutions or issuers of securities or engaged in the insurance of deposits
or otherwise involved with the supervision or regulation of GWBI or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(a) GWBI has timely made all filings required to be filed by it with the SEC
under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since June 30, 2012 (the "GWBI
SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing dates or, if amended, as of the
date of the last amendment prior to the date hereof, the GWBI SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and, at the respective times they
were filed, none of the GWBI SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto) of GWBI
included in the GWBI SEC Documents complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the GWBI and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein). Except as disclosed in the GWBI SEC Documents filed with
the SEC prior to the date 

hereof or as required by GAAP, the GWBI has not, between June 30, 2012 and the
date hereof, made or adopted any change in its accounting methods, practices
or policies in effect on June 30, 2012.

officer of GWBI (or each former principal executive officer and former
principal financial officer of GWBI, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or under
the Exchange Act (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect to the GWBI SEC
Documents and, at the time of filing of each such certification, such
certification was true and accurate. GWBI has made available to Company a
summary of any disclosure made by GWBI's management to GWBI's auditors and the
audit committee of GWBI's Board of Directors referred to in such
certifications. For purposes of this Section 2.8(b), "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c) Except as disclosed in any GWBI SEC documents, GWBI has established and
maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that GWBI maintains records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the respective transactions and
dispositions of assets of GWBI and its Subsidiaries, (ii) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of
GWBI and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of GWBI's and its Subsidiaries' assets that
could have a material effect on GWBI's financial statements. GWBI's management
has previously completed an assessment of the effectiveness of GWBI's internal
control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, presented in any applicable GWBI SEC Document that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of the end
of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. As
of their respective filing dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last
amendment prior to the date hereof, to the extent required by applicable Law,
GWBI has disclosed, in any applicable GWBI SEC Document that is a report on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto prior to the date hereof, any
change in GWBI's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the period covered by such report or amendment that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, GWBI's internal
control over financial reporting. GWBI has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to GWBI's auditors
and the audit committee of GWBI's Board of Directors (x) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect GWBI's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in GWBI's internal
control over financial reporting. 

(d) GWBI has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by GWBI in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to GWBI's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make the certifications required
pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. GWBI's management
has previously completed an assessment of the effectiveness of GWBI's
disclosure controls and procedures and, as of their respective filing dates
or, if amended, as of the date of the last amendment prior to the date hereof,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable GWBI SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto
prior to the date hereof its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation.

(e) No accounting rule, opinion, standard, consensus or pronouncement
applicable to GWBI or any of its Subsidiaries has been finally adopted and not
subsequently withdrawn by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
the Emerging Issues Task Force, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
or any similar body that GWBI or any of its Subsidiaries is required to
implement (whether currently or after a prescribed transition period) but has
not yet implemented as of the date of this Agreement and that, if so
implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
GWBI.

(f) GWBI is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NYSE. Except as permitted by the
Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and 13(k)(3), since the enactment of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither GWBI nor any of its Affiliates has made,
arranged or modified personal loans to any executive officer or director of
GWBI.

Section 2.9 Proxy Statement. None of the information concerning GWBI and its
Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by reference in the proxy
statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered to Company Stockholders (the
"Proxy Statement") and that was supplied in writing by GWBI to Company
expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, will, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting any event
shall occur which is required at that time to be described in the Proxy
Statement, or to amend any statements in the Proxy Statement, such event shall
be so described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, as required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders
of Company.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except as set forth in the letter dated the date hereof and delivered on the
date hereof by Company to GWBI, which letter relates to this Agreement and is
designated the Company Letter (the "Company Letter"), (each section of which
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty in this
ARTICLE III) and such other representations and warranties in this ARTICLE III
to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make
its relevance to such other representation and warranty reasonably apparent).
Company represents and warrants to GWBI as follows:

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Company Bank is a bank duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of South
Dakota and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Company and its Subsidiaries are duly
qualified to do business, and are in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of their properties owned or held under lease or the nature of
their activities makes such qualification or good standing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

Section 3.2 Capital Structure.

(f) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 10,000,000 shares of
$0.01 par value per share Company Common Stock, 500,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 par value, and 50,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, $1.00 stated value. At the close of business on September 30,
2015, (i) 7,054,451 shares of Company Common Stock 

were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights; (ii) 2,083,455 shares of Company
Common Stock were held in the treasury of Company; and (iii) no shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding
options (the "Company Stock Options") to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the 1996 Director
Restricted Stock Plan and the 1991 Stock Option Plan, each of which has
expired (collectively, the "Company Equity Plans"); and (iv) the Company had
an aggregate of 72,348 stock appreciation rights (the "Stock Appreciation
Rights"), which, upon exercise, entitle the holder thereof to receive a number
of shares of Company Common Stock, the aggregate value of which shall equal,
as nearly as possible, the amount by which the "market value" (defined to mean
the average of the high and low quoted sales price on the date of exercise) of
the Company Common Stock exceeds the exercise price, multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such Stock
Appreciation Right shall have been exercised. No shares of Company's preferred
stock or Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding. Company Equity Plans are the only benefit plans of Company or its
Subsidiaries under which any securities of Company or its Subsidiaries are
issuable. Each share of Company Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to
any Company Equity Plan has been duly authorized and, if and when issued
pursuant to the terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth above, no
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Company are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except for the Stock Appreciation Rights
outstanding on the date hereof, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights,
puts or Contracts to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound obligating Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver, sell or redeem or otherwise acquire, or
cause to be issued, delivered, sold or redeemed or otherwise acquired, any
shares of capital stock (or other voting securities or equity equivalents) of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Company or its Subsidiaries
to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, put or
Contract. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Letter sets forth a true and correct
list as of September 30, 2015 of each record holder of Company Common Stock,
with a notation as to which of such holders are current employees of Company
or its Subsidiaries. Company does not have any outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of Company on any matter. There are no Contracts to which
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or
directors is a party concerning the voting of any capital stock of Company or
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Contract" means any
contract, agreement, instrument, guarantee, indenture, note, bond, mortgage,
permit, franchise, concession, commitment, lease, license, arrangement,
obligation or understanding, whether written or oral.

(g) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Company's Subsidiaries
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and other
than as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Letter, all such shares are
of record and beneficially owned by Company free 

and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights
of first refusal, limitations on voting rights, charges and other encumbrances
of any nature whatsoever ("Liens"). Section 3.2(b) of the Company Letter sets
forth the authorized capital stock of each Subsidiary and indicates the number
of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, the number of issued shares
of capital stock held as treasury shares and the number of shares of capital
stock unissued and not reserved for any purpose of the Subsidiary. There are
no agreements, arrangements, Contracts, options, warrants, calls, rights or
commitments of any character relating to the issuance, sale, purchase or
redemption of any shares of capital stock of the Subsidiary.

(h) Other than as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Letter, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly (i) owns, of record
or beneficially, any outstanding voting securities or other equity interests
in any Person, (ii) has the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of any Person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise, or (iii) has any right or obligation to
acquire any equity interest in or to make a capital contribution to any
Person.

(i) Section 3.2(d) of the Company Letter sets forth a complete and accurate
list, as of the date hereof, of (A) all Stock Appreciation Rights, Company
Stock Options and other outstanding options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock issued under Company Equity Plans, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto, the grant dates, the plans under which
such options were granted, expiration dates, exercise or base prices (if
applicable) and vesting schedules thereof, the names of the holders thereof
and the amount each such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4(c) and (B) all shares of Company Common Stock or other share-based awards
that were outstanding but were subject to vesting or other forfeiture
restrictions or were subject to a right of repurchase by Company at a fixed
purchase price as of such time under Company Equity Plans, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, the grant and issuance dates,
the plan under which such awards were granted, vesting schedules and
repurchase price (if any) thereof and the names of the holders thereof.

(j) Company has delivered to GWBI true and complete copies of Company Equity
Plans and all forms of award agreements with respect to the grant of all
Company Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof and no stock option
agreement or other award agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with
or in addition to such forms.

complies, and has been operated and administered to comply, in all material
respects, with its terms and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 ("ERISA"), the Code and any other applicable Law. There are no actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to
Company's Knowledge, threatened involving any Company Plan or the assets of

contributed to or had any liability under, a "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Letter, with respect
to each Multiple Employer Pension Plan, (i) no proceeding has been initiated
by any Person to terminate 

such plan; (ii) there has been no "reportable event" (as such term is defined
in Section 4043(b) of ERISA); (iii) no material liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by Company or any of its ERISA

such liability and no such liability will become a liability of Company or any

year; (v) no plan has been required to file information pursuant to Section

standards or an extension of any amortization period within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 or 303 of ERISA; (viii) there are no

Code) currently in effect; (ix) the assets of each such plan are sufficient to
satisfy all obligations of the plan if the plan were to terminate as of the

occurred and, to Company's Knowledge, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
or any Company Plan fiduciary could be subject to any liability under the
terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law. Each
Company Plan, if any, that is intended by its terms to be, or is otherwise
treated by Company as, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been the
subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS or with respect to a
prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the IRS to the prototype
sponsor, to the effect that such Company Plan is so qualified, and that such
Company Plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal income
Taxes under Section 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. To Company's
Knowledge, no event has occurred relating to any such Company Plan that would
adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs. Each of
the Company Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof.

(g) Neither Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability or
obligation under any Company Plan or otherwise to provide post-employment or
retiree benefits to or in respect of any former employee or any other Person
other than as specifically required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
ERISA or other applicable Law. Neither Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
has any liability of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, direct,
indirect, contingent or otherwise, on account of a violation of the health
care requirements of Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code or Part 6 or 7 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. With respect to any Company Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan, no such Company Plan is 

unfunded or funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined
in Section 419(e) of the Code).

(h) To Company's Knowledge, there are no nonexempt prohibited transactions

Stockholder Meeting, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company
or its Board of Directors from taking any of the actions described in clauses
(iii) and (iv) above in response to any unsolicited bona fide written Takeover
Proposal by such Third Party, if and only to the extent that, (1), in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, after
consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, (1) such Takeover
Proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (2) the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Company to Company's
stockholders under applicable Law, (3) prior to furnishing such non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Third
Party, the Board of Directors of Company receives from such Third Party an

of such Takeover Proposal or request, including providing the identity of the

Takeover Proposal which was not previously provided to GWBI. 

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to GWBI), the approval,

or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such

consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding Section 4.2(c), at any time prior to the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock at the
Stockholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of Company may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal made after
the date hereof and which shall not have been withdrawn if such Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and its outside financial advisor) that the failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Company to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law; provided,
however, that (i) no such Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made if
Company failed to comply with this Section 4.2, (ii) no such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall be made until after the third (3rd) Business Day
following GWBI's receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Adverse
Recommendation") from Company advising GWBI that the Board of Directors of
Company intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of Company (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and a new three (3) Business Day period), identifying the
Person making such proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to
effect such Superior Proposal and representing that Company has complied with
this Section 4.2, (iii) during such three (3) Business Day period, Company and
its advisors shall negotiate with GWBI in good faith to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of
Directors of Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iv) the Board of
Directors of Company shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
if, prior to the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, GWBI makes
a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Company's
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with 

its financial advisors) to be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal
after giving effect to, among other things, the payment of the Termination
Fee.

(g) Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of
Company from taking and disclosing to Company's stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act so long as such disclosure is limited to
(i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) an
express rejection of an applicable Takeover Proposal or (iii) an express
reaffirmation of Company Recommendation; provided, however, that any action
that constitutes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
compliance with Section 4.2(d).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

(ii) "Acquisition Transaction" means any transaction or series of related
transactions other than the Merger and the Bank Merger involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from Company by any Third Party of more than a 5%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Third Party beneficially owning 5% or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 95% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction in
substantially the same proportion as prior to such transaction; (D) any sale,
lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more than 5%
of the assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; or (E) any liquidation or dissolution of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries;

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover
Proposal to acquire more than (A) 50% of the outstanding voting securities of
Company or (B) 50% of the consolidated assets of Company and its Subsidiaries,
in either case on terms that, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and its outside legal counsel, taking into account relevant legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the Termination Fee, the
identity of the Third Party making such proposal and the conditions for
completion of such proposal is more favorable, from a financial point of view,
to the stockholders of Company than the Merger, taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by GWBI in response to such
proposal or otherwise);

(iv) "Third Party" means any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder)
other than GWBI and its Affiliates; 

(v) "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, offer or proposal by a Third Party
relating to any Acquisition Transaction; and

(vi) "Termination Fee" means an amount equal to $5,000,000.

Section 4.3 Third Party Standstill Agreements. During the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement relating
to a Takeover Proposal or standstill agreement to which Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party (other than any agreement involving GWBI). During such
period, Company agrees to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements, including obtaining
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall

cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all commercially reasonable acts
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in ARTICLE VI to be
satisfied; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Entities (the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals"); (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals
from Persons other than Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with such Persons, if any, including
without limitation, the approval by the trustees of HF Financial Capital Trust
III, HF Financial Capital Trust IV, HF Financial Capital Trust V, and HF
Financial Capital Trust VI, each a Delaware statutory trust organized for the
purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in
subordinated debentures of Company (the "Trusts"), of supplemental indentures 

pursuant to which GWBI will assume the obligations of Company under the
existing indentures and guarantees related to the Trusts; and (iv) the taking
of all commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any Action
by any Governmental Entity.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither
GWBI nor Company shall be obligated to contest any final action or decision
taken by any Governmental Entity challenging the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) in no event shall GWBI or
any of its Affiliates be required to offer or pay any consideration or agree
to any requirement, restriction, covenant, undertaking, limitation or
divestiture of any kind whatsoever as a condition to obtaining the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (other than conditions which impose an immaterial burden
on GWBI, Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, Affiliates or assets) or in
order to avoid, prevent or terminate any action by any Governmental Entity
which would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) Company shall not, without
GWBI's prior written consent, take or agree to take any action described in
clause (i) or (ii) immediately above, and (iv) the condition in Section 6.1(c)
shall not be deemed satisfied if any Requisite Regulatory Approval contains
any conditions or restrictions other than conditions which impose an
immaterial burden on GWBI, Company, or any of their Subsidiaries, Affiliates
or assets.

(i) GWBI and Company will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of any other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(j) Each party shall use all reasonable best efforts to not take any action,
or enter into any transaction, which would cause any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or result in a breach of
any covenant made by it in this Agreement.

Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Neither GWBI nor Company will issue any
press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such
transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national or foreign securities exchange or the rules of the NYSE or
NASDAQ.

Section 5.7 Real Estate Transfer Taxes. GWBI and Company agree that Company
will pay any state or local transfer, gains or similar Taxes which are
attributable to the transfer of the beneficial ownership of Company's or its
Subsidiaries' real property, if any (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), and
any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes, payable in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. Company and GWBI agree to
cooperate with the other in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all
real 

property interests held by Company and its Subsidiaries and any information
with respect to such properties that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns. The portion of the consideration allocable to the real properties of
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be determined by GWBI in its reasonable
discretion. The stockholders of Company shall be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by the allocation established pursuant to this Section 5.7 in the
preparation of any return with respect to the Transfer Taxes.

Section 5.8 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, GWBI and
Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable
best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and
otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 5.9 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(d) GWBI agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by Company or its Subsidiaries now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as provided in the charter or bylaws of Company or its
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, or pursuant to any
other agreements in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing Date
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms.

(e) Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and GWBI shall cause Company and its
Subsidiaries to, obtain as of the Closing Date pre-paid directors' and
officers' liability "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6)
years from the Closing Date and providing coverage for claims arising out of
or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), with at least the same coverage and limits, and containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy in place immediately prior to the Closing Date and covering
such directors and officers; provided that in no event shall Company or its
Subsidiaries be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Company or its Subsidiaries
for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum
Premium"). The Maximum Premium is set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the Company
Letter. Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts (and consult
with GWBI in such process) to obtain such policies for premium amounts as
contemplated by this Section 5.9(a). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium,
Company and its Subsidiaries shall obtain, and GWBI shall 

cause them to obtain, that amount of pre-paid directors' and officers'
liability "tail" insurance policies obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium.



(f) The obligations of GWBI, Company, and its Subsidiaries under this Section
5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in any manner as to adversely affect
any director or officer to whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent
of such affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that the
directors and officers to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 5.9).

(g) In the event GWBI, Company, Company's Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of GWBI,
Company, or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

Section 5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. GWBI shall use its reasonable
best efforts to give prompt notice to Company, and Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to GWBI, of: (i) the occurrence,
or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of which it
is aware and which would be reasonably likely to cause (A) any representation
or warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement
of the notifying party contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or
satisfied in all material respects; (ii) any failure of GWBI or Company, as
the case may be, to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; and
(iii) any change, event or effect which would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company or
on GWBI, as the case may be. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.11 Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements.

(a) GWBI agrees that it will, from and after the Effective Time, honor all
employment Contracts entered into by Company prior to the date hereof and
described in Section 5.11(a) of the Company Letter. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be interpreted as limiting the power of GWBI to offer to continue the
employment of any employee or the engagement of any independent contractor of
Company or its Subsidiaries or, other than as required by its terms, any
written employment Contract. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee
of employment for any employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
restrict the right of Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
terminate or cause to be terminated the employment of any such employee at any
time for any or no reason with or without notice; provided, however, 

that in the event that after the Effective Time any Eligible Employee of
Company or its Subsidiaries is terminated from employment without cause prior
to the date which is one (1) year from the Effective Time, GWBI shall provide
severance benefits consisting of one week of pay for each year of service with
Company or its Subsidiaries, with a minimum of two (2) weeks' salary and a
maximum of sixteen (16) weeks' salary. "Year of Service" as used herein means
each full twelve-month period for which such employee was an actual employee
of Company or its Subsidiaries and shall not include any such time period
where such employee was previously employed by GWBI or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any other entity other than Company. GWBI and Company
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.11 are
included for the sole benefit of GWBI, Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, and that nothing in this Section 5.11, whether express or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) of GWBI, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
or (ii) to continued employment with GWBI, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or continued participation in any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement.

(b) Following the Effective Time, GWBI shall cause employees of Company or its
Subsidiaries to be eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement maintained by GWBI or any of its Affiliates (each such
plan, program or arrangement, a "GWBI Plan"), and shall cause its Affiliates
and the applicable GWBI Plan, to recognize prior service of such employees
with Company and its Subsidiaries as service with GWBI and its Affiliates to
(i) credit each employee's service with Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any predecessor employers thereto, to the extent credited under the analogous
Company Plan, as service with GWBI and its Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under such GWBI Plan, but not for any other purposes,
including for purposes of determining benefit accruals, vacation benefits or
early retirement subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan of GWBI or
its Affiliates; provided, however, that in no event shall the employees be
entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations,
eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements
to show evidence of good health under such GWBI Plan, to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or satisfied
under the analogous Company Plan in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be waived with respect to such
employee and such individual's spouse and eligible dependents who become
participants in such GWBI Plan, subject to the conditions, regulations,
underwriting criteria or similar provisions imposed by any of GWBI's insurers.

(c) Each employee who is listed on Section 5.11(c) of the Company Letter (an
"Eligible Employee") shall be eligible to receive the severance benefits
provided for in Section 5.11(a) as set forth on Section 5.11(c) of the Company
Letter. 

(d) Each employee of Company or any Subsidiary of Company who is listed on
Section 5.11(d)(i) of the Company Letter shall be eligible to receive the
retention bonus set forth on Section 5.11(d)(i) of the Company Letter pursuant
to a retention agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
D. Each employee of Company or any Subsidiary of Company who is listed on
Section 5.11(d)(ii) of the Company Letter shall be eligible to receive the
stay bonus set forth on Section 5.11(d)(ii) of the Company Letter pursuant to
a stay bonus agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the execution of Retention
Agreements by the employees listed on Section 5.11(d)(i) of the Company
Letter.

Section 5.12 Certain Litigation.

(c) Company shall promptly advise GWBI orally and in writing of any Action
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company
or Company Bank, and shall keep GWBI reasonably informed on a timely basis
regarding any such Action. Each party shall promptly advise the other party
orally and in writing of any actual or threatened Action against such party
and/or the members of the Company board of directors or GWBI's board of
directors related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company shall: (i) permit GWBI to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of GWBI in connection
with, any proposed written or oral response to such Action; (ii) furnish GWBI
and its outside legal counsel with all non-privileged information and
documents which GWBI or its outside counsel may reasonably request in
connection with such Action; (iii) consult with GWBI regarding the defense or
settlement of any such Action, shall give due consideration to GWBI's advice
with respect to such Action and shall not settle any such litigation prior to
such consultation and consideration; provided, however, that Company shall not
settle any such Action if such settlement requires the payment of money
damages, without the written consent of GWBI (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by Company, with
respect to a stockholder Action, is reasonably expected by Company, following
consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any
deductible to be paid by Company) under Company's existing director and
officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

(d) Company shall promptly advise GWBI orally and in writing of the
commencement of any investigation or audit by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Company, Company Bank or any of their respective directors or
employees and shall keep GWBI reasonably informed on a timely basis regarding
any such investigation or audit (regardless of whether commenced before or
after the date of this Agreement), including by promptly delivering to GWBI
copies of any correspondence relating thereto. Company shall give GWBI the
opportunity to consult with Company regarding such investigation or audit and
shall consider GWBI's views with respect to such investigation or audit. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.12(b) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to GWBI. 

Section 5.13 Transition Services. Set forth as Section 5.13 of the Company
Letter are certain procedures in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Company and GWBI shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, comply with the provisions thereof.

Section 5.14 Title Insurance. Company shall cooperate with GWBI and provide
such information as GWBI may reasonably request from time to time, in
connection with any application of GWBI for title insurance with respect to
any Company or Company Bank owned real property.

other approval is sought, the Stockholder shall vote (or cause to be voted)
the Subject Shares against (i) any merger agreement or merger (other than the
Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation, combination, sale of
substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of or by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Takeover Proposal, (ii) any amendment of Company's Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or Bylaws or other proposal or transaction

respect or (C) change in any manner the voting rights of any class of capital
stock of Company, and (iii) any nomination, proposal to elect or election of
any person as a director of Company who is not a member of Company's Board of

(d) The Stockholder shall use the Stockholder's reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with GWBI in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to support and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

(e) The Stockholder hereby agrees not to (i) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of (including by gift) (collectively, "Transfer"), or enter
into any contract, option or other arrangement (including any profit-sharing
arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of such Stockholder's Subject Shares
to any person or (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy,
voting agreement or otherwise, in relation to such Stockholder's Subject
Shares except in favor of the Merger.

(f) The Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take any action
inconsistent with the foregoing.

2. Representations and Warranties. The Stockholder represents and warrants to GWBI as follows:

and marketable title to, the Subject Shares set forth below the Stockholder's
name on the signature page hereto, free and clear of any Liens; and (ii) holds
stock options to acquire that number of shares of Common Stock set forth below
the Stockholder's name on the signature page hereto. The Stockholder does not
own, of record or beneficially, or hold any conversion rights, exchange
rights, warrants or stock options to acquire, any shares of capital stock of
Company other than the Subject Shares. The Stockholder has the sole right to
vote, and the sole power of disposition with respect to the Subject Shares,
and none of the Subject Shares is subject to any voting trust, proxy or other
agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to, the voting or

(b) The Stockholder has the legal capacity and all requisite power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the Stockholder's
obligations hereunder and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
GWBI, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the 

Stockholder enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may affect the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder
does not and will not conflict with any agreement, order or other instrument
binding upon the Stockholder, nor require the Stockholder to make or obtain
any regulatory filing or approval.

3. Termination. The obligations of the Stockholder hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 thereof or the Effective Time.

4. Further Assurances. The Stockholder will, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as GWBI may reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5. Successors, Assigns and Transferees Bound. Any successor, assignee or transferee (including a successor, assignee or transferee as a result of the death of the Stockholder, such as an executor or heir) shall be bound by the terms hereof, and the Stockholder shall take any and all actions necessary to obtain the written confirmation from such successor, assignee or transferee that it is bound by the terms hereof.

6. Recapitalizations, Stock Dividends, etc. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities of Company shall be declared with a record date within such period, (c) any other securities of Company shall be declared with a record date within such period or (d) any similar event shall have occurred, then the term "Subject Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include such shares as well as all such additional shares, stock dividends and any other securities into which or for which any or all of such changes may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction.

7. Stockholder Information. The Stockholder hereby agrees to permit GWBI and Company to publish and disclose in the Proxy Statement the Stockholder's identity and ownership of the Subject Shares and the nature of the Stockholder's commitments, arrangements and understanding under this Agreement.

8. Stop Transfer Order. In furtherance of this Agreement, the Stockholder hereby authorizes and instructs Company to instruct its transfer agent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Subject Shares.

9. Remedies. The Stockholder acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it and that any such breach would cause GWBI irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, GWBI, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. 

10. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction, or the validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

11. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written instrument executed and delivered by both the Stockholder and GWBI.

12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

13. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not defined herein shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

14. Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties, this Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and representations by or among the parties with respect to this Agreement, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

16. Waivers. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature.

17. No Limitation on Actions of the Stockholder as Director. In the event the Stockholder is a director of Company, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require the Stockholder to take or in any way limit any action that the Stockholder may take to discharge the Stockholder's fiduciary duties as a director of Company.

Re: Retention Bonus Agreement

Dear [Employee]:

As you may know, HF Financial Corp. (the "Company") has entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger with Great Western Bancorp., Inc. ("Great
Western"), dated as of November __, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), under which
Great Western, the parent of Great Western Bank ("GWB"), will acquire the
Company. As part of the transaction, Home Federal Bank (the "Bank") will merge
with GWB. For purposes of this Letter Agreement (defined below) the term Bank
shall include GWB and any successor thereof.

The Bank believes that your continued employment with the Bank will be
critical to the Company's successful consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). For this reason, the Bank
is pleased to inform you that you have been selected to receive a special
retention bonus award to encourage you to remain focused and dedicated to the
Company and the Bank through the consummation of, and following, the Merger.
The purpose of this letter (the "Letter Agreement") is to set forth the terms
and conditions of your retention bonus agreement with the Bank.

1.Retention Bonus Award.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Letter Agreement,
you will be eligible to receive a retention bonus award ("Retention Award") of
restricted share units ("RSUs") by Great Western under the Great Western
Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, in the amount and on
the date(s) set forth on Exhibit A to this Letter Agreement. The RSUs will
only vest provided that you remain continuously employed by the Bank or one of
its affiliates through the vesting date of the Retention Award.

If the Bank terminates your employment without Cause (as defined below), prior
to the vesting of your RSUs, you will be entitled to receive the value of your
Retention Award in a lump sum cash payment within 60 days after the date of
your termination of employment, provided that you execute and return a valid
confidential general release agreement provided by Bank within the time period
as specified by the Bank in the agreement (and if applicable, you do not
revoke such agreement).

If you terminate your employment for any reason or if the Bank terminates your
employment for Cause, any unvested RSUs will be forfeited.

If your employment ends due to a qualified Disability or Retirement, the RSUs
will remain outstanding and vest on the applicable vesting date as if you had
remained employed through the applicable vesting date.



Upon termination due to death, the RSUs will immediately vest as of the date
of such termination.

(b) For purposes of this Letter Agreement, "Cause" shall mean a termination of
your employment due to the occurrence of one or more of the events set forth
below which, with respect to an event specified in clause (A) or (D) below, if
curable, you have not cured within 14 days after you received written notice
from the Bank or any of its affiliates specifying with reasonable
particularity such occurrence: (A) your failure or willful refusal to comply
in any material respect with lawful Bank employment policies or directives,
(B) your commission of willful misconduct or an act of fraud, theft or
embezzlement against the Bank or any of its affiliates, (C) your conviction or
plea of nolo contendere to any felony or any other crime involving moral
turpitude, (D) your repeated failure to substantially perform the duties and
responsibilities of your position or (E) your breach of Section 5, below.

2. Confidentiality. You understand, acknowledge and agree that because the Bank is extending this arrangement to only a few key employees, you will keep the existence of this Letter Agreement and its terms and conditions set forth herein completely confidential, except that the foregoing will not limit your ability to discuss the terms and conditions with your immediate family members, legal advisors or personal tax or financial advisors, or, solely for the purpose of disclosing the limitations on your conduct imposed by the provisions of Section 5, below, your prospective future employers, provided that you give to each such person to whom disclosure is made, notice of the confidentiality provisions of this Letter Agreement and each agrees to keep the existence, terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement fully confidential.

3. At-Will Employment. Nothing in this Letter Agreement will be held or construed to create a contract of employment for a definite term or otherwise alter your status as an "at-will" employee of the Bank and either you or the Bank may terminate your employment with the Bank at any time and for any reason (or no reason), subject only to the payment obligation of the Bank in the event of your termination without Cause as set forth in Section 1(a), above.

4. Special Incentive Award. The Retention Award is a special incentive award to you and will not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation for purposes of determining any bonus, incentive, pension, retirement, death or other benefit under any other bonus, incentive pension, retirement, insurance or other employee benefit plan or agreement of the Bank or any of its affiliates, unless such plan or agreement expressly provides otherwise. Subject to the provisions of Section 13, below, the Retention Award is in addition to any amount or benefit payable under your regular salary, compensation and bonus plans following the Merger and any such other agreement or plan unless such agreement or plan expressly provides otherwise.

5. Covenants. In consideration of, and as a condition of your receipt of the Retention Bonus Award, you agree to be bound by the terms below. 

(a) Non-Disparagement. You agree not to make negative comments or otherwise
disparage the Bank or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents or products, in any manner likely to be harmful to them
or their business, business reputation or personal reputation.

(b) Non-Solicitation. During your employment with the Bank or one of its
affiliates and for a period of 12 months from the date of that you are no
longer employed by the Bank or one of its affiliates (the "Restricted
Period"), you will not solicit, aid or induce (directly or indirectly, on your
own behalf or on behalf of any individual or entity other than the Bank) any
then





current employee, representative or agent of the Bank or any of its affiliates
to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or render
services to or with any other person, firm, corporation or other entity
unaffiliated with the Bank or hire or retain any such employee, representative
or agent, or take any action to assist or aid any other person, firm,
corporation or other entity in identifying, hiring or soliciting any such
employee, representative or agent. In addition, during the Restricted Period,
you will not call on or solicit the business of, or sell to (directly or
indirectly, on your own behalf or in association with any other individual or
entity), any of Bank's customers with whom you actually did business and had
personal contact while employed by Bank, except to the extent such activities
are unrelated to, and not competitive with, the business, products and/or
services that you offered or provided on behalf of Bank and cannot adversely
affect Bank's relationship or volume of business with such customers. Nothing
in this section shall be deemed to restrict or otherwise limit your
obligations under Section 5(a) above.

(c) Protection of Confidential Information. You acknowledge that your
employment with the Bank has brought you and will bring you into close contact
with many confidential affairs of the Bank and its affiliates, including
without limitation the Bank's trade secrets and information about costs,
profits, customers, markets, sales, products, key personnel, policies,
operational methods and other business affairs and methods and other
information not readily available to the public, and plans for further
development ("Confidential Information"). Accordingly, you hereby covenant
and agree that you will deliver promptly upon termination of your employment,
or at any other time the Bank may also request, all Confidential Information
in the form of memoranda, notes, records, reports and any other documents or
media (and all copies thereof) relating to the Bank's business which you may
then possess or have under your control. In addition, for as long as such
information remains sensitive and confidential in nature, and is not made
public (other than as a result of your action or inaction, direct or
indirect), you agree that you will hold in strictest confidence all matters of
the Bank or any of its affiliates that are not otherwise in the public domain
and will not, directly or indirectly, disclose or otherwise communicate them
to anyone outside of the Bank or use them for yourself or otherwise, either
during or after the period of your employment with the Bank or its affiliates.

(d) Remedies. If you commit a breach of, or threaten to breach any of the
provisions of this Section 5, in addition to the Bank's rights to terminate
any and all of its obligations hereunder, the Bank will have the right to an
injunction or order of specific enforcement, without necessity of posting a
bond or providing independent evidence of irreparable injury, by any court
having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Bank, and
that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Bank.

(e) Tolling. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Section
5, you acknowledge and agree that the post-termination restrictions contained
in this Section 5 will be extended by a period of time equal to the period of
such violation, but in no event longer than 24 months, it being the intention
that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period will be
tolled during any period of such violation.

(f) Survivability. The obligations contained in this Section 5 will survive
the termination of your employment with the Bank and will be fully enforceable
thereafter.

(g) Acknowledgement. You specifically acknowledge and agree that this Letter
Agreement is entered into pursuant to the sale of a business and its goodwill
and that you have access to Bank trade secrets during your employment with the
Bank. Accordingly, you acknowledge





and agree that the restrictions in this Section 5 are necessary and reasonable
for the protection of the Bank's trade secrets and customer goodwill. You also
acknowledge that this Section 5 is reasonable given the nature of the Bank's
and its affiliates' businesses, and you agree not to challenge the
reasonableness or enforceability of the covenants contained in this Section 5
in the future.

6. Disputes.

(a) Except for injunctive relief provided under Section 5, above, any and all
disputes arising under, pertaining to or touching upon this Letter Agreement,
or the statutory rights or obligations of either party hereto, will, if not
settled by negotiation, be subject to non-binding mediation before an
independent mediator mutually selected by you and the Bank. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any party hereto may seek preliminary
injunctive or other judicial relief if such action is necessary to avoid
irreparable damage during the pendency of the proceedings described in this
Section 6. Any demand for mediation will be made in writing and served upon
the other party to the dispute, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
at the address of the Bank's executive offices and at your address as on file
with the Bank. The Bank's executive office address is 225 South Main Ave.,
Sioux Falls SD 57104. The demand will set forth with reasonable specificity
the basis of the dispute and the relief sought. The mediation hearing will
occur at a time and place convenient to you and the Bank in South Dakota
within 30 days of the date of selection or appointment of the mediator.

(b) If the dispute is not settled through mediation, the parties agree, as
their exclusive recourse, to submit to binding arbitration before an
independent arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 6. The mediator will
not serve as the arbitrator. The arbitration hearing will be conducted before
one arbitrator mutually selected by you and the Bank and will occur at a time
and place convenient to the parties in South Dakota (applying South Dakota
law), within 60 days of the selection or appointment of the arbitrator unless
such time period is extended by the arbitrator for good cause shown. If the
Bank has adopted a policy that is applicable to arbitrations with employees,
the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with that policy. If no such
policy has been adopted, the arbitration will be governed by the Employment
Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the AAA in effect on the date of
the first notice of demand for arbitration. Notwithstanding any provisions in
such rules to the contrary, the arbitrator will issue findings of fact and
conclusions of law, and an award, within 15 days of the date of the hearing
unless the parties otherwise agree. The determination of the arbitrator will
be final and binding on you and the Bank, and judgment may be entered on the
award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction.

(c) In connection with any such mediation or arbitration, the Bank will pay
the mediator and arbitrator costs and expenses (including forum fees and costs
of the mediator or arbitrator), except to the extent that the Bank
substantially prevails on the merits of its claims in such arbitration, in
which case you will pay and reimburse to the Bank all such costs and expenses.
Each party shall bear their own legal fees and costs.

7. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Letter Agreement contains the entire understanding between you and the Bank with respect to the subject matter of this Letter Agreement. This Letter Agreement may not be altered, amended, modified or terminated except in a writing executed by you and the Bank.

8. No Assignment. The Retention Award payable under this Letter Agreement will not be subject to alienation, transfer, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, and any attempt to cause any Retention Award to be so subjected will not be recognized. 





9. Funding. The Retention Award will be distributed from the Bank's authorized common stock and reserved under the Great Western Bancorp, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as and when amounts are payable under the terms of the Letter Agreement, and will not be held in trust or any other fiduciary capacity before distribution to you.

10. Governing Law. This Letter Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of South Dakota applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within that State without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

11. Reformation and Severability. You agree that if the scope of any provision of this Letter Agreement is held to be too broad to be enforced as written, such provision(s) shall be reformed to such narrower scope as to be enforceable. You further agree that if any provision of this Letter Agreement is held to be unenforceable, and such provision cannot be reformed as anticipated above, such provision shall be deemed separate and severable and the unenforceability of any such provision shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any of the remaining provisions hereof. You acknowledge and agree that it is your intention and the intention of the Bank that the provisions of this Letter Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under law.

12. Binding Effect. The rights and obligations of this Letter Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Great Western and any successor of the Bank by reorganization, merger or consolidation, or any assignee of all or substantially all of the Bank's business and properties. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the consummation of the Merger, the affiliates of the Bank shall include Great Western and its affiliates. The Bank may assign its rights and obligations under this Letter Agreement to any of its affiliated companies, but shall remain liable for any obligations provided hereunder not timely made by any assignee. Your rights under this Letter Agreement shall inure to the benefit of your heirs and beneficiaries.

13. Effectiveness. This Letter Agreement will only be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger does not occur for any reason, including the termination of the agreement pursuant to which the Merger was to occur, this Letter Agreement will terminate automatically, immediately and without any action by you or the Bank, and will be of no further force and effect. If the Letter Agreement terminates, neither you nor the Bank will have any liability under or in respect of this Letter Agreement. 

14. Section 409A Compliance. The Retention Award under this Letter Agreement is intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as a "short-term deferral," and this Letter Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of excise taxes and other penalties under Section 409A of the Code ("409A Penalties"). In the event that the terms of this Letter Agreement provide deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and do not comply with such section and regulations promulgated thereunder, the parties will cooperate diligently to amend the terms of this Letter Agreement to avoid 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances will the Bank be responsible for any taxes, penalties, interest or other losses or expenses incurred by you due to any failure to comply with Section 409A.

15. Counterparts. This Letter Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, will constitute one agreement and may be delivered by the electronic transmission, by facsimile or otherwise, of a signature page.





We thank you for your commitment to the Bank. In order to accept the terms
described in this Letter Agreement and for this Letter Agreement to be valid
and binding, please sign this Letter Agreement in the space provided below and

Very truly yours,

employment with the Bank has brought you and will bring you into close contact
with many confidential affairs of the Bank and its affiliates, including
without limitation the Bank's trade secrets and information about costs,
profits, customers, markets, sales, products, key personnel, policies,
operational methods and other business affairs and methods and other
information not readily available to the public, and plans for further
development ("Confidential Information"). Accordingly, you hereby covenant
and agree that you will deliver promptly upon termination of your employment,
or at any other time the Bank may also request, all Confidential Information
in the form of memoranda, notes, records, reports and any other documents or
media (and all copies thereof) relating to the Bank's business which you may
then possess or have under your control. In addition, for as long as such
information remains sensitive and confidential in nature, and is not made
public (other than as a result of your action or inaction, direct or
indirect), you agree that you will hold in strictest confidence all matters of
the Bank or any of its affiliates that are not otherwise in the public domain
and will not, directly or indirectly, disclose or otherwise communicate them
to anyone outside of the Bank or use them for yourself or otherwise, either
during or after the period of your employment with the Bank or its affiliates.

(k) Remedies. If you commit a breach of, or threaten to breach any of the
provisions of this Section 5, in addition to the Bank's rights to terminate
any and all of its obligations hereunder, the Bank will have the right to an
injunction or order of specific enforcement, without necessity of posting a
bond or providing independent evidence of irreparable injury, by any court
having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Bank, and
that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Bank.





(l) Tolling. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Section
5, you acknowledge and agree that the post-termination restrictions contained
in this Section 5 will be extended by a period of time equal to the period of
such violation, but in no event longer than 24 months, it being the intention
that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period will be
tolled during any period of such violation.

(m) Survivability. The obligations contained in this Section 5 will survive
the termination of your employment with the Bank and will be fully enforceable
thereafter.

(n) Acknowledgement. You specifically acknowledge and agree that this Letter
Agreement is entered into pursuant to the sale of a business and its goodwill
and that you have access to Bank trade secrets during your employment with the
Bank. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that the restrictions in this
Section 5 are necessary and reasonable for the protection of the Bank's trade
secrets and customer goodwill. You also acknowledge that this Section 5 is
reasonable given the nature of the Bank's and its affiliates' businesses, and
you agree not to challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of the
covenants contained in this Section 5 in the future.

6. Disputes.

(d) Except for injunctive relief provided under Section 5, above, any and all
disputes arising under, pertaining to or touching upon this Letter Agreement,
or the statutory rights or obligations of either party hereto, will, if not
settled by negotiation, be subject to non-binding mediation before an
independent mediator mutually selected by you and the Bank. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, any party hereto may seek preliminary
injunctive or other judicial relief if such action is necessary to avoid
irreparable damage during the pendency of the proceedings described in this
Section 6. Any demand for mediation will be made in writing and served upon
the other party to the dispute, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
at the address of the Bank's executive offices and at your address as on file
with the Bank. The Bank's executive office address is 225 South Main Ave.,
Sioux Falls SD 57104. The demand will set forth with reasonable specificity
the basis of the dispute and the relief sought. The mediation hearing will
occur at a time and place convenient to you and the Bank in South Dakota
within 30 days of the date of selection or appointment of the mediator.

(e) If the dispute is not settled through mediation, the parties agree, as
their exclusive recourse, to submit to binding arbitration before an
independent arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 6. The mediator will
not serve as the arbitrator. The arbitration hearing will be conducted before
one arbitrator mutually selected by you and the Bank and will occur at a time
and place convenient to the parties in South Dakota (applying South Dakota
law), within 60 days of the selection or appointment of the arbitrator unless
such time period is extended by the arbitrator for good cause shown. If the
Bank has adopted a policy that is applicable to arbitrations with employees,
the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with that policy. If no such
policy has been adopted, the arbitration will be governed by the Employment
Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the AAA in effect on the date of
the first notice of demand for arbitration. Notwithstanding any provisions in
such rules to the contrary, the arbitrator will issue findings of fact and
conclusions of law, and an award, within 15 days of the date of the hearing
unless the parties otherwise agree. The determination of the arbitrator will
be final and binding on you and





the Bank, and judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any
court having proper jurisdiction.

(f) In connection with any such mediation or arbitration, the Bank will pay
the mediator and arbitrator costs and expenses (including forum fees and costs
of the mediator or arbitrator), except to the extent that the Bank
substantially prevails on the merits of its claims in such arbitration, in
which case you will pay and reimburse to the Bank all such costs and expenses.
Each party shall bear their own legal fees and costs.

7. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Letter Agreement contains the entire understanding between you and the Bank with respect to the subject matter of this Letter Agreement. This Letter Agreement may not be altered, amended, modified or terminated except in a writing executed by you and the Bank.

8. No Assignment. The Stay Bonus Payments payable under this Letter Agreement will not be subject to alienation, transfer, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, and any attempt to cause any Stay Bonus Payment to be so subjected will not be recognized. 

9. Funding. The Stay Bonus Payments will be paid from the Bank's general assets, as and when amounts are payable under the terms of the Letter Agreement, and will not be held in trust or any other fiduciary capacity before payment to you.

10. Governing Law. This Letter Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of South Dakota applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within that State without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

11. Reformation and Severability. You agree that if the scope of any provision of this Letter Agreement is held to be too broad to be enforced as written, such provision(s) shall be reformed to such narrower scope as to be enforceable. You further agree that if any provision of this Letter Agreement is held to be unenforceable, and such provision cannot be reformed as anticipated above, such provision shall be deemed separate and severable and the unenforceability of any such provision shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any of the remaining provisions hereof. You acknowledge and agree that it is your intention and the intention of the Bank that the provisions of this Letter Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under law.

12. Binding Effect. The rights and obligations of this Letter Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Great Western and any successor of the Bank by reorganization, merger or consolidation, or any assignee of all or substantially all of the Bank's business and properties. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the consummation of the Merger, the affiliates of the Bank shall include Great Western and its affiliates. The Bank may assign its rights and obligations under this Letter Agreement to any of its affiliated companies, but shall remain liable for any payments provided hereunder not timely made by any assignee. Your rights under this Letter Agreement shall inure to the benefit of your heirs and beneficiaries.

13. Effectiveness. This Letter Agreement will only be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger does not occur for any reason, including the termination 





of the agreement pursuant to which the Merger was to occur, this Letter
Agreement will terminate automatically, immediately and without any action by
you or the Bank, and will be of no further force and effect. If the Letter
Agreement terminates, neither you nor the Bank will have any liability under
or in respect of this Letter Agreement.

14. Section 409A Compliance. The payments under this Letter Agreement are each intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as a "short-term deferral," and this Letter Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner that avoids the imposition of excise taxes and other penalties under Section 409A of the Code ("409A Penalties"). In the event that the terms of this Letter Agreement provide deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and do not comply with such section and regulations promulgated thereunder, the parties will cooperate diligently to amend the terms of this Letter Agreement to avoid 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances will the Bank be responsible for any taxes, penalties, interest or other losses or expenses incurred by you due to any failure to comply with Section 409A.

15. Counterparts. This Letter Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, will constitute one agreement and may be delivered by the electronic transmission, by facsimile or otherwise, of a signature page.

We thank you for your commitment to the Bank. In order to accept the terms
