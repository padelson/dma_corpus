express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to the Purchaser or its agents or
representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement;   (b) agrees, to
the fullest extent permitted by law (except with respect to claims of fraud),

to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to cause each of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VII below to be satisfied, in each case, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (including seeking early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act), provided that such efforts shall not
include any requirement to expend a material amount of money, commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any third party for any extraordinary purpose or in response to any
extraordinary demand. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Sellers and the Purchaser hereby agree to provide promptly to Governmental
Entities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
antitrust laws all information and documents requested by any such
Governmental Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and to file    22   any
Notification and Report Form and related material required under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later

its reasonable best efforts to complete as soon as practicable its
substantial compliance with any requests for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act. Furthermore, prior
to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall use their reasonable
commercial efforts to assist the Purchaser in any undertaking to retire the
Company\'s outstanding High-Yield Debt (which such retirement, whether
pursuant to a tender offer made by the Purchaser or otherwise, would occur
following, and be contingent upon, the Closing); provided however, that under
no circumstances shall the Company be required to call any outstanding High-
Yield Debt for redemption, or shall the Company or any Seller be required to
expend a material amount of money, unless the Purchaser has agreed in writing
to reimburse the Company and/or the Sellers for such amounts.   SECTION 6.2
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.   (a) Except as may be otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement or required by law or any Contracts disclosed in Section 4.15
of the Disclosure Letter or as the Purchaser may otherwise consent to in

the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries, to operate its business in all material respects in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice.   (b) Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as may be otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement or required by Law or any Contracts disclosed, or not required
to be disclosed, in Section 4.15 of the Disclosure Letter or as the Purchaser

withheld or delayed), from the date hereof and prior to the Closing, neither

equity  equivalents (including, without limitation, stock appreciation
rights),  or amend in any respect any of the terms of any such securities
or  equity equivalents outstanding on the    23    date hereof;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company  may issue,
reissue, amend the terms of or cancel any rights under the  Company\'s
Phantom Equity Program or any other stock appreciation rights  so long as any
amounts payable pursuant to such rights are satisfied at  the Closing from
the Purchase Price and provided further, that the  Company may amend the
Super Performance Based Phantom Equity Agreements  (the "SP Agreements") set
forth on Section 6.12(iv) of the Disclosure  Letter in the manner
contemplated by and consistent with the terms of  the Form of Letter
Agreement attached as Exhibit C hereto. Such  amendments shall not, however,

Exhibit C hereto without the  prior written consent of the Purchaser;  
(iii) amend or propose to amend its certificate of  incorporation, bylaws

ACCESS. From the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide the Purchaser with such information as the Purchaser may from time to
time reasonably request with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their assets and properties and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall provide the Purchaser and its representatives reasonable
access during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice to the
personnel, representatives, properties, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably
request. Any disclosure whatsoever during such investigation by the Purchaser
shall not constitute any enlargement or additional representations or
warranties of the Company or any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
beyond those specifically set forth in this Agreement. All such information
and access shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 14, 2003, executed by the Purchaser
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").   SECTION 6.4 No Solicitation. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, representatives or agents, shall, directly or indirectly,
encourage, solicit, participate in, initiate or continue discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person (other than the
Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives) concerning any merger, sale
of assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transactions involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a division of the Company and any
existing discussions or negotiations with third persons relating thereto
shall be terminated immediately.   SECTION 6.5 BOOKS AND RECORDS. For a
period of seven (7) years from the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to any Seller for any
purpose relating to such Seller\'s ownership of any securities of the
Company, access to the books and records of the Company related to periods
prior to the Closing Date upon reasonable advance written notice during
regular business hours for the sole purpose of obtaining information for use
as aforesaid and will permit such Seller to make such extracts and copies
thereof as may be necessary. Such Seller shall reimburse the Company or its
Subsidiaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of
them in performing the covenants contained in this Section 6.5.   SECTION
6.6 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries hereby exculpate (to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law), contingent upon but automatically effective
upon the Closing and the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, the present and former officers, employees and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party") against all
Losses, arising out of actions or omissions in their capacities as such
occurring at or prior to the    25   Closing to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\'
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or substantially equivalent
documents), and any agreement between an Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in effect at the date of this Agreement set forth in
Section 6.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter, including, without limitation,
advancing expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, provided
that (i) the Company shall pay for only one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest and (ii) such advancement of
expenses shall be subject to such Indemnified Party\'s agreement to return
any advanced funds if a court of competent jurisdiction, after all time for
appeals having been exhausted, shall have determined that the Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnity against such expenses under applicable law
or the Company\'s certificate of formation or the LLC Agreement.   (b) If
(but only if) for any reason the indemnity provided for in Section 6.6(a) is
unavailable to any Indemnified Party, as the case may be, or is insufficient
to hold each such Indemnified Party, as the case may be, harmless from all
such Losses, then the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
successors shall each contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative benefits received by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the one
hand and such Indemnified Party, as the case may be, on the other but
also the relative fault of such persons as well as any relevant
equitable considerations.   (c) Prior to the Closing, if available, the
Company may purchase a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy
(the terms of which will be acceptable to the Sellers) providing coverage for
the Company\'s pre-closing officers and directors for a period of up to six
years following the Closing (the "Tail"). The premium and other expenses
related to the acquisition of such policy will be paid by the Company and
shall not be considered fees and expenses of the transaction for purposes of
Section 9.14 hereof, provided that, if the purchase price and other expenses
related to the acquisition of the Tail exceeds $600,000, any amounts in
excess of $600,000 shall be paid by the Sellers. The Company shall not
cancel, limit, modify or amend the Tail while it is in effect.   (d) The
obligations of the Company under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.6 applies (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.6 applies are hereby made express and intended
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6).   SECTION 6.7 NO TRANSFERS.
After the date of this Agreement, none of the Sellers shall sell, pledge,
encumber or otherwise transfer any or all of the Securities or any interest
therein.   SECTION 6.8 TRADEMARK AND TRADE NAME RELEASE. Except as set forth
in Section 6.8 of the Disclosure Letter, effective only as of the Closing
Date, each of the Sellers does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably forever
waive and release all rights to use any of the trade names and any trademarks
set forth in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Letter (or any trademarks likely
to be confused therewith). The Sellers shall have thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date to remove such trade names and trademarks from any of
Sellers\' materials (but notwithstanding the    26   foregoing, shall
have a limited license to use such trade names and trademarks in connection
with disclosing their prior ownership of the Company in marketing and similar
materials.   SECTION 6.9 Releases.   (a) Release of Company. Effective as
of the Closing Date, except for those matters set forth in Section 6.9(a) of
the Disclosure Letter, each of the Sellers does hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably forever release and discharge Razor, Shaver, the Company and its
Subsidiaries from all obligations and liabilities to the Sellers, all
agreements and understandings involving the Sellers other than this Agreement
and the instruments and documents delivered by the Purchaser or the Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement, and all claims and causes of action (whether at
law or in equity) of the Sellers against Razor, Shaver, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, arising prior to the Closing Date.   (b) Release of the
Sellers. Effective as of the Closing Date, except for those matters set forth
in Section 6.9(b) of the Disclosure Letter, each of Razor, Shaver, the
Company and its Subsidiaries does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
forever release and discharge each of the Sellers from all obligations and
liabilities to each of Razor, Shaver, the Company and its Subsidiaries, all
agreements and understandings involving Razor, Shaver or the Company or its
Subsidiaries other than this Agreement and the instruments and documents
delivered by the Purchaser or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, and all
claims and causes of action (whether at law or in equity) of Razor, Shaver or
the Company or its Subsidiaries against the Sellers arising prior to the
Closing Date.   SECTION 6.10 PAYMENT OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. Prior to
or on the Closing Date, Razor, Shaver, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall pay any amounts due
and owing the other. Vestar shall cause Razor and Shaver to extinguish on or
prior to Closing those liabilities that are payable to certain Affiliates
referenced in Section 3.4(d).   SECTION 6.11 NO INTERFERENCE;
NONDISCLOSURE.   (a) No Interference with Customers. During the
period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for a period of two
years thereafter (the "Non-Interference Period", each of the Sellers agrees
that neither it nor any of its Affiliates which it controls shall induce a
Customer to withdraw, curtail or cancel such Customer\'s business with the
Purchaser or its Affiliates. As used in this Section 6.11, "Customer" means
any actual customer of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, or any potential
customer of the Purchaser or its Affiliates, served or actually solicited by
the Purchaser or the Company or its Subsidiaries within the twelve-month
period prior to the Closing Date.   (b) No Interference with Employees.
Each Seller agrees that, during the Non-Interference Period, neither it nor
any of its Affiliates which it controls will directly or indirectly request
or induce any employee to terminate his employment with the Purchaser or its
Affiliates and accept employment with another business entity engaged in the
Business in North America, Europe, Australia or New Zealand (the "Territory")
except as set forth in Section 6.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter, or hire
during the Non-Interference Period, any employee within    27   twelve
(12) months after termination of such employee\'s employment with
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. This Section 6.11(b) shall not be
construed to prohibit each Seller or its Affiliates from placing general
advertisements for employees in newspapers, periodicals or other media of
general circulation or hiring any such employees as a result thereof, other
than the employees who are parties to the agreements listed as items 21,
23-33 and 34(b) in Section 4.15 of the Disclosure Letter.   (c) Trade
Secrets; Confidential Information.   (i) Each of the Sellers recognizes
and  acknowledges that it has had access to certain highly sensitive, 
special, unique information of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is 
confidential or proprietary. Each of the Sellers hereby covenants and  agrees
that it and its Affiliates which it controls will not (A) as to  Trade
Secrets for a period of seven years and (B) as to Confidential  Information,
during the Non-Interference Period, use or disclose any  Trade Secrets or
Confidential Information, except for disclosures to  authorized
representatives of the Purchaser; provided, however, that  the foregoing
restrictions shall not apply to (1) items that have  entered the public
domain other than by an unauthorized disclosure by  the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, (2) any items required to be  disclosed by a Governmental
Entity or under applicable Laws, or (3)  Confidential Information received
subsequently from third parties not  known by the Sellers to be subject to
confidentiality restrictions.   (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, (A)
"Trade  Secret" means any currently existing information, including, but
not  limited to, technical or non-technical data, a formula, a pattern, a 
compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a set of 
guidelines, a procedure, a drawing, a process, financial data,  financial
plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential  customers or
suppliers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, that derives  economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known to  and not being readily
ascertainable by proper means by other persons  who can obtain economic value
from its disclosure or use and is the  subject of efforts that are reasonable
under the circumstances to  maintain its secrecy or otherwise constitutes a
trade secret under  applicable Law; and (B) "Confidential Information" is any
currently  existing data or information of the Company or its Subsidiaries
other  than Trade Secrets, which is competitively sensitive and not
generally  known to the public.   SECTION 6.12 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.   (a)
From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to (i) continue in effect for at least one year following
the Closing Date for current and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries the Employee Benefit Plans, or to provide other plans, programs,
policies, arrangements or agreements that will provide such employees and
former employees with benefits as are in the aggregate comparable to the
benefits provided to such employees and former employees under the Employee
Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) adopt a severance plan
for certain employees having the terms described in Section 6.12(ii) of
the Disclosure Letter, pursuant to which any such employee who is terminated
by the Company or its successor without cause on or prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing will be entitled to a payment equal to the greater
of (x) the amount determined    28   in accordance with the provisions
of the plan described in Section 6.12(ii) of the Disclosure Letter or (y) any
amounts to which such employee is entitled pursuant to any agreement between
such employee and the Company, (iii) make the severance payments described in
the agreements set forth in Section 6.12 (iii) of the Disclosure Letter in
the event that any such payments become due and payable and (iv) in the event
that the "Performance Criteria" as defined in those certain SP Agreements
listed on Section 6.12(iv) of the Disclosure Letter, as each such agreement
has been modified prior to the date hereof and as any such agreement may be
amended and/or modified following the date hereof solely in the form of the
Letter Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C, (which result in aggregate
payments under all SP Agreements of not more than $2,763,750), have been met,
make payment under the outstanding SP Agreements in accordance with the terms
thereof. Nothing in this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to require
the Purchaser to cause to be continued any employee\'s employment,
responsibilities or title for any period or to change the terms of any
existing employee benefit program.   (b) For purposes of determining
whether the Performance Criteria referenced in Section 6.12(a)(iv) above has
been met, the terms "EBITDA" and "RVM" (as applied by the Company with
respect to the SP Agreements) shall be determined and calculated in a manner
strictly consistent with the accounting principles and methods applied by the
Company in the preparation of the Financial Statements and measurements that
it has used historically to determine these amounts (including, without
limitation, for the Company\'s 2002 fiscal year). For the avoidance of doubt,
in determining whether the EBITDA/RVM targets have been met with respect to
the SP Agreements, the Company shall make such determination without giving
effect to any cost, expense, charge or other item arising from, related to or
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
purchase of the Tail pursuant to Section 6.6(c)) nor any purchase accounting
or other adjustments to the Company\'s accounting or tax basis in its assets
and/or liabilities arising from, related to or resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Purchaser\'s financing or any retirement or repayment of the Company\'s
indebtedness, including any related fees and expenses). In the event that,
following the Closing, the Company engages in any transaction involving the
acquisition or disposition of, or a fundamental change in, the Company\'s
business, material assets or business units, whether by means of asset
purchase or sale, stock purchase or sale, merger, combination,
recapitalization or otherwise, and such transaction or change is reasonably
expected to affect the Company\'s "EBITDA" and/or "RVM," whether in the
period during which such transaction or change occurs or any subsequent
period for which "EBITDA" and/or "RVM" will be measured for the purpose of
determining whether the Performance Criteria have been met, then the Board of
Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith, in consultation with
Alexander Castaldi, the amount, if any, of the adjustments that should be
made to the Performance Criteria.   SECTION 6.13 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.
Neither the Company, the Sellers, the Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consultation with the other Parties,
except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with, or the
policies of, a national securities exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate to prepare a joint press
release to be    29   issued on the Closing Date and, upon the request
of any of the parties hereto, at the time of the signing of this
Agreement.   SECTION 6.14 LITIGATION SUPPORT. In the event and for so long
as any Party actively is contesting or defending against any third party
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim,
or demand in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement, or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to
act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Sellers or
the Company, the Purchaser agrees to (a) cooperate with the contesting or
defending party and its counsel, (b) make available the employees of the
Business then employed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to
assist counsel, and (c) provide reasonable access to its and the Company\'s
or any Subsidiary\'s books and records as shall be necessary in connection
with the defense or contest; provided that, the contesting or defending party
shall pay the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the party so
cooperating (unless the contesting or defending party is entitled
to indemnification therefor under this Article VI).   SECTION 6.15 TAX
PROCEDURES.   (a) Notwithstanding anything regarding the time
of distributions to the contrary in Section 5.5 of the LLC Agreement, the
Company shall, as promptly as practicable following its determination of the
members\' distributive shares of taxable income for the period preceding
Closing, make a Tax Distribution to the members in respect of income
allocated for such short taxable period which the members shall apply to the
taxes related thereto; provided, however, that the Company shall not make any
Tax Distribution to the members prior to Closing to the extent any member has
a "Shortfall Amount" (as defined in the LLC Agreement) with respect to
previous taxable years.   (b) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed (in each case in a manner consistent with
past practice) all federal, state and local Tax Returns of Razor, Shaver, the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account any
extensions) for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and
shall provide the Purchaser with the opportunity to review and comment upon
such filings prior to the time they are filed and the Sellers shall not file
such filings without the Purchaser\'s consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the Sellers have requested such consent and have
not received within fifteen (15) days of making such request either the
Purchaser\'s consent or a written notice from the Purchaser that describes in
reasonable detail any dispute that the Purchaser has with any information
contained in the subject Tax Return (a "Dispute Notice"), then the Purchaser
shall automatically be deemed to have given such consent. In the event that
the Purchaser has delivered a Dispute Notice, such dispute(s) shall be
subject to good faith negotiation among the Sellers, the Purchaser and their
respective tax advisors for a period of ten (10) days, and if there has been
no resolution of all such dispute(s) within such ten (10) day period, then
unless otherwise agreed, any remaining disputes shall then be submitted to an
independent "Big Four" accounting firm (or, if all "Big Four" accounting
firms shall have a conflict of interest, any other nationally recognized
accounting firm), that has not performed material services for the Company,
the Sellers or the Purchaser or any of their respective   
30   controlled Affiliates for a period of at least one (1) year, selected
by the respective tax advisors of the Sellers and the Purchaser (the "Tax
Return Arbitrator"), which shall act as an arbitrator and shall issue its
report resolving all such disputes within ten (10) days after such dispute is
referred to and accepted by it. The Tax Return Arbitrator shall use its best
judgment to resolve the disputed matters in a manner that most consistently
reflects the Company\'s or other affected entity\'s past custom and practices
so long as such past custom and practices are consistent with applicable law.
The subject Tax Return, as so modified, may be filed by the Sellers with the
appropriate government authorities without the consent of the Purchaser. The
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be paid one-half by the Purchaser
and one-half by the Sellers. The Purchaser shall be liable for all Taxes
payable with respect to the operations of Razor, Shaver, the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing, and shall be responsible for filing the
necessary Tax Returns and reports with respect to the operations of Razor,
Shaver, the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending after
the Closing.   (c) Each party shall provide to each other party
such information as may reasonably be requested by the other party in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to liability for Taxes with respect to Razor, Shaver, the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Each Party shall retain, for a reasonable
period of time, and provide the other Parties upon request and reasonable
notice with, any records or information which they in fact have and which may
be relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceeding or
determination. The Party responsible for filing a Tax Return pursuant to
subsection (a) above shall control any audits, disputes, administrative,
judicial or other proceedings relating to such Tax Returns; provided that no
Party may agree to settle any Tax liability or compromise any claim with
respect to Taxes if such settlement or compromise may affect the liability
for Taxes of the other Party, without such other Party\'s consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (d) Sellers shall
promptly notify Purchaser, and Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers, in
writing, of any notice of a tax deficiency, assessment or audit relating to
Razor, Shaver, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   SECTION 6.16
PHANTOM EQUITY DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT. The Company will establish the Phantom
Equity Disbursement Account, no later than three days prior to the Closing,
with a commercial banking institution selected by the Company. The Company
will provide instructions to such banking institution for the payment to each
Phantom Equity Participant of his or her respective share of the Aggregate
Phantom Equity Payment, less all payroll tax withholdings. Such payments will
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds or cashiers or
certified check. Prior to the Closing, the Company will instruct such banking
institution to make such payments promptly upon receipt of the Aggregate
Phantom Equity Payment from Purchaser.   SECTION 6.17 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every month (but in no
event later than the twentieth day of the following month) beginning with the
month in which this Agreement is signed, the Company shall deliver to the
Purchaser an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the applicable    31   scheduled end of such month,
and a related consolidated statement of operations for such month, which meet
the standard for Financial Statements set forth in Section 4.4(ii).  
SECTION 6.18 COMMITMENT. The Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees to use and
to cause its Subsidiaries to use their respective commercial best efforts and
to do all other things to obtain for itself and/or the Company the financing
necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether from the issuer of the Commitment Letter or from other sources) in
accordance with the Commitment Letter. The Purchaser hereby represents that
there are no conditions to the closing of the financing as contemplated by
the Commitment Letter other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter and
the payment of fees related thereto. The Purchaser further covenants and
agrees that (i) it will not terminate, modify, amend or in any manner alter
the obligations of the issuer of the Commitment Letter in any manner that is
adverse to the Purchaser\'s ability to obtain financing for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at any time prior to the termination of this
Agreement and (ii) it will enforce its rights to obtain the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter to the fullest extent
permitted by law. The Purchaser will promptly use its commercial best efforts
to enable the Purchaser to consummate the "Bridge Loans" under the Commitment
Letter if the Senior Subordinated Notes have not been sold by October 1,
2003.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO THE CLOSING   SECTION 7.1 CONDITIONS

correct as contemplated above, considered collectively, would  have a
Material Adverse Effect, provided that in determining whether  such failure
would have a Material Adverse Effect, all "material,"  "Material Adverse
Effect," "in all material respects" and similar  qualifiers in Article IV
(other than qualifications specifically  referring to a certain dollar
amount), shall be ignored for purposes of  this Section 7.1(a)(ii).   
32    (b) No Prohibition. No order, judgment, ruling, charge, decree or
injunction of any Government Entity shall be in effect which is final and

authorizations, exemptions and waivers from Government Entities, which
consents shall be required in order to (i) enable the Purchaser to consummate

authorizations, exemptions and waivers, the absence of which would not
prohibit consummation of such transactions or render such consummation
illegal) and (ii) enable the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their
businesses after the Closing on the same basis as conducted prior to the date
hereof shall have been obtained (excluding, however, the failure to obtain
any consents, approvals, authorizations, exemptions and waivers the failure
of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect).   (d) The Purchaser shall have obtained financing in
the amount specified in the Commitment Letter.   (e) Document Deliveries.
The Purchaser shall have received from the Company the documents listed in
Section 2.4(e) hereof, from the Sellers, the documents required pursuant to

material respects with its agreements and covenants  contained herein on,
prior to or as of the Closing Date.   (ii) The representations and
warranties of the  Purchaser contained herein shall have been true and

in all  material respects on the Closing Date, except for representations

date of this Agreement, which shall be true as of such date or time.  This
condition shall be deemed satisfied unless the failure of the

contemplated above, in the aggregate, would have a Purchaser  Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) No Prohibition. No order, judgment, ruling,
charge, decree or injunction of any Government Entity shall be in effect

Section 7.2(c) of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, which consents shall be
required in order to enable the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for such consents, approvals, authorizations,
exemptions and waivers, the absence of which would not prohibit consummation
of such transactions or render such consummation illegal).   (d) Document
Deliveries. Each Seller shall have received from Purchaser the documents
listed in Section 2.4(a)(ii)-(vi) hereof and the Purchase Price.   ARTICLE
VIII   TERMINATION   SECTION 8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be

Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to the Sellers,on
the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, if their or its failure to
fulfill any obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; or  
(c) By either Vestar on behalf of the Sellers or the Purchaser, if there
shall be any statute, law, rule or regulation that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or prohibited or if any court or

stockholders or Affiliates in respect thereof.   SECTION 9.2 REMEDIES. No
