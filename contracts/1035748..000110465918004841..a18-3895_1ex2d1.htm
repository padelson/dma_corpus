 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto,

      
 

 



 

at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_ and, as so
amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter further amended as provided therein, subject to
Section 5.08, or by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be automatically
amended and shall become references to the Surviving Corporation and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until his or her
successor shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until his
or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until his or her
successor shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until his
or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.02 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 1:00 p.m., New York time, on a
date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be
no later than the third International Business Day after satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Allen and Overy LLP, 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY
10020, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may agree to in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other

 



      
 

 



 

filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and
time as may be agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

Section 1.03 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

 



 

(a) Promptly, and in any event within 10 Business Days, after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy
materials for the Special Meeting (together with any amendments and
supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement. Subject to Section
5.03(d) and Section 5.03(e), the Company shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall also include the text
of the Fairness Opinion (in its entirety) in the Proxy Statement together with
a summary thereof. Parent shall provide promptly to the Company such
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.03(a), prior to filing the
preliminary Proxy Statement, a definitive Proxy Statement or any Other Filing
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
each such filing in advance, and the Company shall include in such filing all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent in respect of such filings; _provided_
that to the extent such comments relate to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change
of Board Recommendation, the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to, but shall not be obligated to include, any such comments
reasonably proposed. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt
of any oral or written comments from the SEC or its staff to such filings (or
of notice of the SECs intent to review) and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing
or for additional or supplemental information in connection therewith. The
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt of such
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any
such Other Filing (i) supply Parent with copies of all written correspondence
received in connection therewith and (ii) provide Parent a reasonably detailed
description of any oral comments received in connection therewith. The Company
(1) shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any responses to any such comments or inquiries by the SEC or its staff,
(2) shall include in such responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
in respect of such filings (except to the extent such comments relate to an
Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Board Recommendation, in which case the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to, but shall not
be obligated to include, any such comments reasonably proposed), (3) except
with respect to a document incorporating a Change of Board Recommendation,
shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC or its staff,
prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (4) shall provide Parent and its counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC or its staff with respect to such filings. The Company shall
respond in good faith to any comments by the SEC or its staff as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Parent shall provide its comments to the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable.

 



 

(c) If the Company: (i) does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file definitive proxy
materials (including the definitive Proxy Statement) with the SEC and cause
the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company
as promptly as practicable and in any event on or prior to the fifth Business
Day after the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule
14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) does receive comments
from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall file definitive proxy materials (including the definitive Proxy
Statement) with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable and in any event
on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately following clearance by the
SEC with respect to such comments.

 



 

(d) If, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting, Parent or the
Company discovers any event or information relating to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to
the extent permissible under applicable Law) no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 40 days after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company, for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Special Meeting_ ") and (ii) subject to Section
5.03, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and secure any
other vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company as required by the
rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date that shall be set as the
"record date" for the Special Meeting in advance of providing notice thereof
to NASDAQ. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the
Special Meeting and shall not change the record date or postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Company may,
following prior written notice to, and consultation with, Parent, adjourn the
Special Meeting by not more than 10 calendar days to the extent (and only if
and to the extent) (i) necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement that the Company Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith is necessary to comply with applicable
Law, is made available to the Companys stockholders in advance of the Special
Meeting, (ii) that, as of the time that the Special Meeting is originally
scheduled, adjournment of the Special Meeting is necessary to enable the
Company to solicit additional proxies required to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting and to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval or (iii) otherwise required by applicable Law,
order or a request from the SEC or its staff. The Company may, and if so
requested by Parent shall, adjourn the Special Meeting in order to provide for
the expiration of any time period provided for in Section 5.03(d) or Section
5.03(e).

 



 

(f) The Company shall ensure that the Special Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in connection
with the Special Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Law. The adoption of this Agreement and adjournment of the
Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall be the only
matters that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of
the Company at the Special Meeting, unless otherwise approved in writing by
Parent.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
(i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting shall not be affected by any Change of Board Recommendation and (ii)
its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of

 



      
 

 



 

any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or the receipt
of any Acquisition Inquiry. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 7.01, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to
the vote of the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company with respect to the Merger at the Special Meeting.

 



 

(h) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or Merger Sub, or with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise
has, directly or indirectly, voting power, in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or
provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other stockholder vote or consent with respect
to the Shares then owned of record by Parent or Merger Sub, or with respect to
which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise has, directly or indirectly, voting
power, that may be required by the rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable net to the holder in
cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f), upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with Section 2.02.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards
shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.04.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Company, and all
Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in amounts and
at times necessary to pay the Merger Consideration to which former holders of
Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU
Awards) shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(a) upon
surrender of

 



      
 

 



 

Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as the case may be. Such funds shall be
invested or otherwise held by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger
Sub, in their sole discretion. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of any
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case,
which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

 



 

(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably specify; and

 



 

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration_. Upon the
surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed
and in proper form in accordance with the instructions thereto, with respect
to such Certificates or an agents message in the case of a book entry
transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.02(b), without interest
and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with Section 2.02(e). If, immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.02(b) to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in
respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration or any other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Article II to any former holder of Shares, Company Options or Shares
subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards, as applicable, such amounts that Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of
applicable Law, including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by
former holders of Shares, Company Options or Shares subject to RSU Awards or
PSU Awards. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, Parent shall pay (unless the
Paying Agent is the entity withholding such amounts, in which case, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay) such amounts to the appropriate taxing
authority and such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration, the posting by such Person of a bond in such sum as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any Action that may be made against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect
to such Certificates, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article II.

 



 

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall
instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262
of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or
other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid

 



      
 

 



 

the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f). The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and Actions
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment (unless
required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle
or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent to pay for Shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned
to Parent upon demand.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
Performance RSUs_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Company to make available existing Company cash, and/or otherwise deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Company funds, in amounts and at times
necessary to make the payments described in this Section 2.04. No later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all
requisite action such that:

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Each Company Option that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of such Company Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation,
within 30 days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company Option,
and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
per share exercise price under such Company Option. If the per share exercise
price under any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled pursuant to this Section
2.04(a) without payment of consideration.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Unvested RSU Awards_. Each Share subject to a Company RSU
(each such award, an " _RSU Award_ ") that remains outstanding immediately
prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in cash, the Merger
Consideration, and such right shall remain subject to the time-based vesting
(including any "double-trigger" acceleration) terms that applied with respect
to the applicable RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
award agreement governing such RSU Award (the " _Replacement RSU_ "). Each
Replacement RSU shall not vest or become payable by the Surviving Corporation
at the Effective Time and shall instead vest and become payable by the
Surviving Corporation on the date upon which the applicable Share subject to
the RSU Award would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and other
conditions, including any "double-trigger" acceleration terms, as set forth in
any agreements listed on Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
_provided_ that any RSU Awards granted after the date of this Agreement as set
forth in Section 5.01(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
treated as set forth in Section 5.01(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and as a result
vesting ceases to continue at any point after the Effective Time, the holder
of the Replacement RSU shall have no right to receive any payment in respect
of the forfeited Replacement RSU or the original RSU Award. Following the
Effective Time, no Replacement RSU may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned
or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person,
other than to the Surviving Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal
or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to
the payment to such Person of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.04(b). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, each
RSU Award held by a non-

 



      
 

 



 

employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall not be assumed,
converted or substituted for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the
Effective Time in exchange for a payment by the Surviving Corporation in
respect of each Share subject to such RSU Award in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a single lump-sum payment as soon
as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following the Effective
Time.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Vested Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs_. Each
Share subject to a Company RSU or Company Performance RSU that is vested but
not yet issued as of the Effective Time shall not be assumed or substituted
for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange
for a payment by the Surviving Corporation in respect of such vested and
unissued Share subject to a Company RSU or Company Performance RSU in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a single lump-
sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days)
following the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Unvested Company Performance RSUs_. Each Share subject to a
Company Performance RSU (each such award, a " _PSU Award_ ") that remains
outstanding immediately prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in
cash, the Merger Consideration, and such right shall remain subject to the
time-based vesting (including any "double-trigger" acceleration) terms that
applied with respect to the applicable PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Replacement PSU_ "). Each Replacement PSU shall not
vest or become payable by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and
shall instead vest and become payable by the Surviving Corporation on the
performance period end date set forth in Section 2.04(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule upon which the applicable Share subject to the PSU Award
would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and other conditions
(other than any performance-based vesting conditions and criteria), including
any "double-trigger" acceleration terms, applicable to such PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If such terms and conditions are not
satisfied and as a result vesting ceases to continue at any point after the
Effective Time, the holder of the Replacement PSU shall have no right to
receive any payment in respect of the forfeited Replacement PSU or the
original PSU Award. Following the Effective Time, no Replacement PSU may be
pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law) by any Person, other than to the Surviving Corporation, or
be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any
Liability of such Person, prior to the payment to such Person of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04(d). Each PSU Award that
will be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.04(d) shall be treated as if the award had vested at the pay-
out levels set forth in Section 2.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Following the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable with respect to
PSU Awards pursuant to Section 2.04(d) shall not be subject to any of the
performance-based vesting terms that currently apply to such awards but shall,
in all events, continue to be subject to the time-based vesting terms
currently applicable to such awards.

 



 

Section 2.05 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Each current
"Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date of this
Agreement under the ESPP shall continue, and, except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.05, the Shares shall be issued to participants thereunder on
the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the
date of this Agreement as provided under, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, the ESPP. Any Offering Period in progress as of the Effective
Time shall be shortened, and the last day of each such Offering Period shall
be the second Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. No new
Offering Period shall commence under the ESPP at or after the date of this
Agreement except, in the case of valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.01, following such termination. Each then
outstanding ESPP Purchase Right shall be exercised automatically on the last
day of such Offering Period. Notwithstanding any

 



      
 

 



 

restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of
any Shares under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 2.01(a).
The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement,
take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP)
that are necessary to give effect to this Section 2.05.

 



 

Section 2.06 _No Right to Equity Under Awards_. The parties agree that
following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option, Company RSU,
Company Performance RSU, ESPP Purchase Right or any other equity-based awards
shall have any right to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Notices; Board or Committee Resolutions_.

 



 

(a) To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated in
Section 2.04 and Section 2.05, the Company shall, at least 10 Business Days
prior to the anticipated Effective Time, use its reasonable best efforts to
provide notice, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to
all holders of outstanding Company Options and Shares subject to RSU Awards or
PSU Awards that are subject to Section 2.04 and to all holders of ESPP
Purchase Rights that are subject to Section 2.05.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company Board or any committee thereof that
administers the Company Stock Option Plans shall adopt resolutions, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, that (i) prohibit the granting of new awards
under any Company Stock Option Plan effective as of or immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) approve the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04
as valid under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award
agreements issued thereunder, and (iii) approve the transactions contemplated
in Section 2.05 as valid under the terms of the ESPP and the award agreements
issued thereunder and terminate the ESPP as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and further document that:

 



 

(A) the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04 are consistent with the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued
thereunder;

 



 

(B) the transactions contemplated in Section 2.05 are valid under the terms of
the ESPP and the award agreements issued thereunder;

 



 

(C) the Surviving Corporations assumption of the obligation to pay any
Replacement RSUs or Replacement PSUs that vest pursuant to the terms set forth
in Section 2.04 will result in the Surviving Corporation substituting an
equivalent award for each RSU Award or PSU Award that becomes subject to the
terms set forth in Section 2.04; and

 



 

(D) the consummation of the Merger will not accelerate the vesting of any
shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards that are exchanged for Replacement
RSUs or Replacement PSUs, except, with respect to RSU Awards, as specifically
provided by Section 2.04(b) with respect to any such RSU Awards held by non-
employee directors of the Company.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Shares, at any time during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall

 



       
 

 



 

be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction; _provided, however_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.08 shall be construed as permitting the Company to
take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section of
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on
its face (without reference to the contents of the documents referenced
therein):

 



 

Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the
extent the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, except with respect to the Company
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in good standing has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be,
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has delivered or caused to be delivered to Parent and Merger
Sub true and complete copies of the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent
organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary. Each of
such documents is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of
the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, and the Company Subsidiaries are
not in violation in any material respect of their respective organizational or
governing documents.

 



 

(c) None of the Company or Company Subsidiaries is an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 



 

(d) Section 3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) a true
and complete list of each Company Subsidiary, together with the jurisdiction
of organization or formation of each Company Subsidiary and (ii) the directors
and officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, as of the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_
"). As of the close of business on January 26, 2018 (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Capitalization Date_ "), there were 66,022,377 Shares issued and
outstanding and 2,338,797 Shares were held in treasury by the Company. No
shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.

 



 

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date (without giving pro
forma effect to the agreements set forth on Section 3.02(b)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), the Company has no shares of capital stock
reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance, except for (i) 178,874 Shares
that are subject to the outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock
Option Plans, (ii) 2,300,051 Shares that are subject to the outstanding
Company RSUs under the Company Stock Option Plans, (iii) 681,043 Shares that
are subject to outstanding Company Performance RSUs under the Company Stock
Option Plans, (iv) up to 138,792 Shares that are subject to the outstanding
ESPP Purchase Rights under the ESPP and (v) 12,146,754 Shares reserved for
future awards under the Company Stock Option Plans. Section 3.02(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date (without giving pro forma effect to the agreements set
forth on Section 3.02(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the
aggregate number of outstanding Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
Performance RSU.

 



 

(c) All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and were
issued in compliance with applicable Law. All Shares subject to issuance under
any Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Performance RSUs and any Company
Stock Option Plan, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time, if any, pursuant
to the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which
they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and issued in material compliance
with applicable Law. Section 3.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date (and giving pro
forma effect to the agreements set forth on Section 3.02(b)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), an accurate and complete list of each
outstanding Company Option, ESPP Purchase Right, Company RSU and Company
Performance RSUs and (i) the employee number of each holder thereof, (ii) the

Performance RSU as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, (iv)

foreign sub-plan) under which each Company Option, ESPP Purchase Right,
Company RSU or Company Performance RSU, as the case may be, was granted and
(vii) the number of holders of ESPP Purchase Rights on a country-by-country
basis. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan"
within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. Each grant of a Company Option,
Company RSU, Company Performance RSUs and ESPP Purchase Right was properly
approved by the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee
thereof) in compliance in all material respects with Law, recorded on the
Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects consistently applied, and were validly issued, and no such grants
involved any "back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect
to the effective date of the grant. Except for Company Options, Company RSUs,
Company Performance RSUs and ESPP Purchase Rights, there are no awards or
rights outstanding under any of the Company Stock Option Plans.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.02(b), there are no Contracts to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, including options, warrants,
debentures, notes or other rights, Contracts, arrangements or commitments of
any character (i) relating to any Equity Interests of the Company, (ii)
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or sell any
Equity Interests of the Company, (iii) providing general voting rights with
holders of Shares or Company Preferred Stock, or convertible into securities
having such rights, or (iv) (A) restricting the transfer of, (B) affecting the
voting rights of, (C) requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of,
or containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (D) requiring the
registration for sale of or (E) granting any

 



      
 

 



 

preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect to, any Shares or other Equity
Interests in the Company. Following the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital
stock or other Equity Interests except upon the exercise of Company Options
and the settlement of Company RSUs or Company Performance RSUs outstanding as
of the close of business on the Capitalization Date and except as permitted
under Section 5.01.

 



 

(e) Section 3.02(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each
Company Subsidiary: (i) its authorized capital stock or other Equity
Interests, (ii) the number of its outstanding shares of capital stock or other
Equity Interests and type(s) of such outstanding shares of capital stock or
other Equity Interests and (iii) the record owner(s) thereof. Other than the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary, there are no
other Equity Interests of any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(f) Except for the rights of the Company or a wholly-owned Company Subsidiary
in their capacity as a holder of the outstanding Equity Interests of a Company
Subsidiary, there are no Contracts of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
including options, warrants, debentures, notes or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party (i) relating to any Equity Interests of a
Company Subsidiary, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue, acquire or sell any Equity Interests of the Company Subsidiaries, (iii)
providing general voting rights with holders of the Equity Interests of any
Company Subsidiary, or convertible into securities having such rights, or (iv)
(A) restricting the transfer of, (B) affecting the voting rights of, (C)
requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or containing any
right of first refusal with respect to, (D) requiring the registration for
sale of, or (E) granting any preemptive or antidilutive rights with respect
to, any Equity Interests in a Company Subsidiary. The Company or another
Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and
clear of any Liens, and all of such Equity Interests have been duly authorized
and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights and were issued in compliance with applicable Law. Except for Equity
Interests in the Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company

None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any
Liability under Section 502 of ERISA. All contributions and payments to such
Company Benefit Plan are fully deductible under Sections 162 or 404 of the
Code. No amount is subject to Tax as unrelated business taxable income under
Section 511 of the Code, and no excise tax could reasonably be expected to be
imposed upon the Company under Chapter 43 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever (i) maintained a Company Benefit Plan that was subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or had any Liability with respect to such plan
or (ii) been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is subject to ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan
is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,
or is funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of
the Code or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(17) of the Code.

 



 

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such
as termination of employment) will (i) result in any compensatory payment
becoming due to any director or employee of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any of their respective Affiliates, or to
any Governmental Entity or other Person on behalf of any such director or
employee, from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any
of their respective Affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise,
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan,
(iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
benefits or (iv) result in the

 



      
 

 



 

payment of any amount that, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or Section
162(m) of the Code.

 



 

(h) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any retiree or
post-employment health, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits
(whether or not insured) to any Person. The Company, each Company Subsidiary
and each ERISA Affiliate are in material compliance with (i) the requirements
of the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the
regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, and any similar state
law and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the
proposed regulations) thereunder.

 



 

(i) The Company does not maintain any Company Benefit Plans that are or may
reasonably be deemed to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code). No award granted under any of the
Company Stock Option Plans is or may reasonably be deemed to be a "non-
qualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or otherwise obligated under,
any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the gross-up of the Tax imposed by
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

 



 

(j) All Foreign Employee Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained, operated and
funded in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law (including
applicable Tax withholding and reporting requirements and applicable legal
filings), (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet
all material requirements for such treatment and (iii) if they are intended to
be funded and/or book-reserved, are funded and/or book reserved in all
material respects, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions.

Subsidiaries of their respective businesses does not constitute unfair
competition or trade practices under applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice from any Person since

_Dispute_ ") related to (A) the Company Owned Intellectual Property or its
validity, registrability, enforceability or ownership, and/or (B) any
Intellectual Property material to and embodied or incorporated in any Company
Products, where such Dispute, if determined adversely, would or would

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the Companys
or a Company Subsidiarys business. To the Companys Knowledge, there exists
no basis that would give rise to such a Dispute. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has threatened in writing or initiated any Dispute against
any Person based on any allegation of infringement, dilution, misappropriation
or other violation of any Company Owned Intellectual Property. To the
Companys Knowledge, no Person is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or
otherwise violating any Company Owned Intellectual Property.

without notice or lapse of time, or both) would reasonably be expected to,
require the disclosure or delivery by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any other Person acting on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, of
any Company Source Code to any third party. Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions

grant rights to, disclose or deliver any Company Source Code to any third
party.

 



 

(n) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is bound to any Contract
that, as a result of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of

(A) grant to any Person any right to or with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by, or licensed to, Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (B) pay any material royalties or
other material amounts to any Person in excess of those payable by any of
them, respectively, in the absence of this Agreement or the Transactions,
provided, in each of clauses (A) and (B), any result affecting Parent, Merger

For any Trade Secrets owned by any other Person that have been provided to the
Company or such Company Subsidiary under Contract, the Company and such
Company Subsidiaries are not in material breach of the terms of such Contract
with respect to the confidentiality or use of such Trade Secrets. Each of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has, and enforces in all material
respects, a policy requiring all employees, consultants and contractors of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to execute Intellectual Property
assignment and confidentiality agreements for the benefit of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary, and to the Companys Knowledge, all current and
former employees, consultants and contactors of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary have executed such an agreement.

in connection with the Company Products and the respective businesses and
operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Systems_ "), and
(ii) to implement and maintain business continuity, backup, security and
disaster recovery plans, procedures and facilities. To the Companys

good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company and the Company
Representatives may (i) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations
with, and only with, the Person (or such Persons representatives) that has

thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all material
documents (including any written or electronic material to the extent such
material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms

as a result of breaching or violating this Section 5.03, that the Company
Board concludes in good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time when the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if it determines in good faith,
After Consultation, that the failure to take such actions contemplated by
clauses (x) and/or (y) below would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x)
effect a Change of Board Recommendation as a result of such Superior Proposal
and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) and
simultaneously enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing
such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Termination Fee to Parent and otherwise complies with the provisions
of Section 7.01(f) and Section 7.02; and; _provided further_ that the Company
Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation or
termination (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not
constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or to terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon which the Company Board
intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and
the identity of the Person or group making such Superior Proposal), and shall
have contemporaneously provided the execution draft of the relevant proposed
definitive transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior
Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")) and other material
documents with respect to such Superior Proposal (including any with respect
to the financing thereof); and

this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing
such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, during the Superior
Proposal Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused the Company Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to
enable Parent to make a binding written offer to effect such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) following the end of
such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered
any such binding written offer in good faith, and After Consultation, the
Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding the terms of any
such binding written offer, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

 



 

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(d)(i) and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.03(d) with respect to such new written
notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the
four Business Days contemplated by Section 5.03(d)(i) above).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Board Recommendation prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained if the Company Board determines in

 



      
 

 



 

good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board may
not effect such a Change of Board Recommendation unless:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation (the "
_Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect such a Change
of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of
Board Recommendation), which notice shall specify the details of such
Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect
such Change of Board Recommendation; and

 



 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (A) if requested
by Parent, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate,
with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make a binding written offer to
effect such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary, and (B) following
the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
considered any such binding written offer in good faith, and After
Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding
the terms of any such binding written offer, it would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law to not effect the Change of Board Recommendation.

 



 

In the event of any changes to the circumstances applicable to the Intervening

taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or otherwise complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9, in each case in response to a tender offer;

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents,
approvals or waivers of third parties with respect to any Contracts of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as may be necessary or appropriate
for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any
Contract of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including such consents as
are necessary such that no third party will obtain additional rights under any
such Contract as a result of the consummation of the Transactions) as a result
of the execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions, including
such consents as are required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided_ that, the Company shall coordinate with Parent and

and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall furnish Parent with an executed affidavit
that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation section

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section
5.04(i), prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall use

effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable and (ii) as promptly as
practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses,
permits, certificates, filings, exemptions, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, registrations, waiting period expirations or terminations,
clearances or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any Action or investigation by
any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the Antitrust
Laws), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. The
Company and Parent shall further (x) cooperate with each other in determining
which additional filings, and which additional consents, licenses, permits,

clearances or Orders are required to be obtained from Governmental Entities
prior to the Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and consummation of the Transactions and (y) use their
reasonable best efforts to timely make all such filings and timely seek all
such consents, licenses, permits, certificates, exemptions, waivers,

(d) The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions and copies of all
filings made by any filing party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions; _provided, however_ , that materials provided by the
Company or Parent and their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the other
party may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
entered into in the ordinary course of business without a purpose

 



      
 

 



 

of avoiding or limiting such partys obligations under this sentence and (y)
as necessary to reasonably preserve attorney-client privilege or to comply
with applicable Law, _provided, however_ , that such materials shall be
provided in unredacted form to outside counsel to the receiving party in
connection with any such application or filing and the receiving party will
cause its outside counsel receiving any such unredacted materials not to
disclose such materials to the directors, officers or employees of such
receiving party without the prior written consent of the producing party.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
5.04, (A) each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt written notice to
the other of any of the following: (i) any notice or other communication from

(f) Subject to applicable Law, each party hereto (or its counsel) shall, to
the extent practicable, permit the other party (or its counsel) to review in
advance any proposed communication by such party relating to the Transactions
to any Governmental Entity. To the extent practicable, none of the parties to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of
the investigation), Action or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party (or its counsel) the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, including under the HSR Act. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other Transactions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such Action or other inquiry, each party hereto
will have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion
or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with
such Action or other inquiry, _provided, however_ , that materials provided by
the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the
other party may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business without a purpose
of avoiding or limiting such partys obligations under this sentence and (y)
as necessary to reasonably preserve attorney-client privilege or to comply
with applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that such materials shall be
provided in unredacted form to the receiving partys outside counsel
representing such party before such Governmental Entity. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control, direct or interfere with the operations of the Company prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the
Merger or the other Transactions, other than filing fees required to be paid
in connection with a filing under any applicable Antitrust Laws, (i) without
the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent
is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or
incur any Liability or other obligation due to such Person, and (ii) neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person
whose

 



      
 

 



 

approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation.

 



 

(h) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not extend any applicable
waiting period under any Antitrust Law or enter into an agreement with any
Governmental Entity to delay or not consummate the Transactions without the
written consent of the other parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates to proffer to, agree to or actually (and none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent of
Parent, proffer to, agree to or actually) (i) divest, hold separate (including
by establishing a trust), or enter into any license (whether pursuant to an
exclusive or nonexclusive license) or similar agreement with respect to, or
agree to restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or
operate in a specified manner, any portion of the business or assets of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) pay any
amounts or make any commitments to obtain any consents, licenses, permits,
certificates, exemptions, waivers, approvals, authorizations, registrations,
clearances or Orders of a Governmental Entity or any other Person (other than

with the Transactions, or (iii) limit in any manner the ability of such
entities to conduct, own, operate or control their respective businesses,
assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, or otherwise enter into any voting trust
arrangement, proxy arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be obligated to litigate or
participate in the litigation of any Action brought by any Governmental Entity
or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay
materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions or seeking to
obtain from Parent or any of its Affiliates any damages in connection
therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of the business, assets or
any Company Product or product of Parent or any of its Affiliates or to
require any such Person to divest, hold separate, or enter into any license
(whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or similar
agreement with respect to any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, Parent or any of its Affiliates from
developing, soliciting, considering, communicating, exchanging or furnishing
information, negotiating, disclosing, entering into or consummating potential
or definitive strategic transactions through both internally generated and
third party proposals.

 



 

(l) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or compromise of any Action against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Transactions and will obtain the prior written
consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Action. For
purposes of this paragraph "participate" means that Parent will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the Action by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not breached), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to the Action but will not be afforded
any decision-making power or other authority over the Action or investigation,
except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.05 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, each of Parent and the Company
shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any event that is
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to each partys obligations
or the other partys obligations set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.05 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
(including any communication required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be issued by any party
or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable national securities exchange
or Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of,
and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.06, (i) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the
Company and the Company Representatives and Parents and the Companys
respective Subsidiaries may make public releases or announcements concerning
the Transactions that are not inconsistent with previous press releases or

Section 5.06, (ii) the Company may make communications to its employees in
compliance with Section 5.07(a), (iii) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the
Company and the Company Representatives and Parents and the Companys

statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company and Parent
and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other
parties, the Merger or the other Transactions and (iv) the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.06 shall not apply to any release or announcement made
or proposed to be made in connection with, or in response to, a Change of
Board Recommendation that is effected in compliance with Section 5.03.

 



 

Section 5.07 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees in the United
States with the Company or a Company Subsidiary that is reflected in the books
and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and
level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation
and severance, if applicable) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees
are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to
the extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of
benefits. To the extent any Company Employee in the United States participates
in a New Plan that is a welfare plan or arrangement of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary following the Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), Parent
and any Parent Subsidiary will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
any insurer or

 



      
 

 



 

service provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-
existing condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent
satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such
Company Employees commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan,
(ii) participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that would
otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the same
extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to such
Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
immediately prior to such Company Employees commencement of participation in
such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by Company
Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan, but only to the extent that
the Company provides documentation of such co-payments and deductibles
reasonably requested by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary within 20 days of such
request.

 



 

(b) Until December 31, 2018, Parent shall provide (or cause a Parent
Subsidiary to provide) the Company Employees in the United States who continue
to be employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as of the Effective Time
(the " _U.S. Continuing Employees_ ") with base salary and base wage rates,
and target annual cash performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or
cash-settled equity based incentive opportunities) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate than the U.S. Continuing Employees were eligible
to earn from the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a copy
of any written communication to be broadly disseminated to employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to the Transactions or regarding
compensation, benefits or other treatment they will receive in connection with
or following the Merger, and will include any reasonable comments from Parent
to such communication that Parent makes in good faith within two Business Days
after Parents receipt of such communication (unless such communication is
substantively similar to such prior communications that have been initially
made after such announcement of the Merger or prior communications that have
been previously provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.07(c)). The
Company shall not disseminate such written communication to employees of the
Company or Company Subsidiary until the earlier of (x) Parents express
consent to such dissemination or (y) two Business Days after the Company has
provided Parent with a copy of such written communication.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect
such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k)
Plan_"), including amending and/or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law and
provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the
Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan.

 



 

(e) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07.
Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.07 or (iii) require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.08 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and each Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent
such individuals are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws, the corresponding organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries
and indemnification agreements, in each case as in existence on the date of
this Agreement and listed in Section 3.13(a)(xxix) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnification Agreements_"), arising out
of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of
the Company and such Company Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the
Company Bylaws, and the corresponding organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements, in each case in existence on the
date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the individual to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the DGCL or by the
applicable indemnification agreement or organizational document, to repay such
advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined
that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable indemnification agreement
or organizational document.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors,
officers and employees of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective
Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the DandO Indemnification
Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase directors
and officers runoff insurance coverage (the " _D andO Runoff Insurance_"), which
by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than six years for the
benefit of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Companys and any
Company Subsidiarys past and present directors and/or officers that are
insured under the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The DandO Runoff
Insurance shall provide coverage for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
such individuals in their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time that is not
less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing directors and
officers policy (true and complete copies of which have been made available to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the DandO
Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder for a period of six years after the Effective Time or,
if such policies are terminated or cancelled during such six-year period,
obtain (subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence) alternative
DandO Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms as set forth in this
Section 5.08(c). Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Runoff Insurance in excess of
250% (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that in the event the
cost of such DandO Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the
aggregate, the Company shall remain obligated to provide, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest DandO Runoff Insurance
coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The Company

 



      
 

 



 

and Indemnified Persons may be required to make reasonable application and
provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable
insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Runoff Insurance.
Parent shall upon written request furnish a copy of such insurance policy to
each beneficiary of such policy.

 



 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and are not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
their properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made
so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of
such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.08, without relieving Parent of its obligations under this
Section 5.08.

 



 

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.08 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.08 applies shall be (if the Closing occurs) third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

 



 

Section 5.09 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, including by
reason of the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto or any other transaction
contemplated to be consummated by the parties pursuant to this Agreement, then
the Company Board shall take all action necessary to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares, Company
Options and Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company RSUs or Company
Performance RSUs, pursuant to this Agreement, and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i) the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01 or (ii) the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the executive officers of the
Company, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall discuss
with Parent, in good faith, in response to reasonable requests from Parent,
material (individually or in the aggregate) operational developments, the
status of relationships with customers, resellers, partners, suppliers,
licensors, licensees, distributors and others having material business
relationships with the Company, the status of ongoing operations and other
matters relating to the Companys business as reasonably requested by Parent.

 



 

(b) No such discussion contemplated by this Section 5.11 shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Rights Agreement_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the date this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 7.01, the Company shall not, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any stockholder rights

 



      
 

 



 

agreement, rights plan, "poison pill" or other similar agreement, unless such
plan or agreement exempts from its application this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Further Action_. In case at any time prior to the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to take
all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and

stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby,
but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. The failure of

 



       
 

 



 

any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 8.06 _Headings_. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 



 

Section 8.08 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. EACH PARTY
HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE
COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE
OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such purported

 



       
 

 



 

assignment in contravention of this Agreement shall be null and void;
_provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights
and obligations to an Affiliate of Parent or to a successor-in-interest by
reason of merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of Parent; _provided further_ that, with respect to an assignment or
transfer by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the prior proviso, (a)
with respect to an assignment to a successor-in-interest, such assignment
includes all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (b) such successor-
in-interest or Affiliate shall have agreed as of such assignment or transfer
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in a writing provided to the
Company, and (c) where this Agreement is assigned or transferred to an
Affiliate by Parent, Parent remains responsible for the performance of this
Agreement and Guarantor remains responsible for all of its obligations under
Section 8.15 as if such Affiliate were "Parent" for purposes of such Section.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
permitted successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, other than pursuant to Section 5.08, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto, without notice or Liability to any other Person. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has
participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges
is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the

provided or that the context otherwise requires:

 



 

(a) whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the
plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders;

are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Annexes and Schedules
to this Agreement;

(j) although the same or similar subject matters may be addressed in different
provisions, the parties intend that, except as reasonably apparent on the face
of the Agreement or as expressly provided in this Agreement, each such
provision shall be read separately, be given independent significance and not
be construed as limiting any other provision of this Agreement (whether or not
more general or more specific in scope, substance or content); and any
Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Laws) by
succession of comparable successor Laws and (in the case of Laws) any rules
and regulations promulgated under said Laws.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (and any Actions arising out of or related hereto or to the
Transactions or to the inducement of any party to enter herein, whether for
breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on
common law, statute or otherwise) shall in all respects be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance, in each case without
reference to any conflict of law rules that might lead to the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall
be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the Transactions or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such Action (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) except in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that
any Action (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) may be heard and
determined in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court
from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Action (whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the
United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and (iv) waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action (whether for breach of
contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute or otherwise) in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the
Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
Action (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions within and outside the United
States of America by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
anywhere in the world in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.03.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.12(C).

 



 

Section 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf, .tif, .jpeg or
similar attachment (" _Electronic Delivery_ ")) in two or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damage. It is accordingly agreed that prior to
any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, (a)
each party shall be entitled at its election to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity
and (b) the parties shall waive, in any Action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. A partys pursuit of specific
performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.15 _Guaranty._

 



 

(a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, SAP SE, a European
Company ( _Societas Europaea_ ) established under the laws of Germany and the
European Union (" _Guarantor_ "), intending to be legally bound, hereby
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due
and punctual payment and performance of (i) Parents and Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement, including any liabilities arising out of a
breach thereof (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This
guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and
effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its
successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been satisfied in
full. Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, if requested by the
Company, it will promptly appoint in accordance with applicable Law a
registered agent for service of process in the State of Delaware, and
Guarantor shall maintain such registered agent as its agent for service of
process in the State of Delaware without interruption until the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) All payments pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be made in lawful money
of the United States, in immediately available funds. Guarantor promises and
undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction,
offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor of any kind.

 



 

(c) The guaranty set forth in Section 8.15(a) (the " _Guaranty_ ") is an
absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and punctual
payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of the Guaranteed Obligations
and not of collection. Should Parent or Merger Sub default in the payment or
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantors obligations
hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to the Company or, if and
only if the Effective Time occurs and to the extent that such obligations
become due and payable thereafter, to the former holders of Shares, Company
Options or Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards. Claims hereunder may be
made on one or more occasions. If any payment in respect of any Guaranteed
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such
Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

 



 

(d) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or
delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time,
place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition,
substitution or release of any Person interested in the Transactions; (iv) any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger
Sub; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or their assets; (vi) the adequacy
of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the
Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other
right which Parent or Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company
(other than satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations or rights of Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of
the acceptance of the Guaranty and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment,
demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest,
notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to
require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person
interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally,
defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to
Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (other than, in each case, fraud,
willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation by the Company or any of
its Affiliates) and defenses available to Guarantor under the Guaranty.
Guarantor acknowledges that it has received and

 



      
 

 



 

will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions
and that the waivers set forth in this Section 8.15 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

 



 

(e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the
Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 preclude
any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this
Section 8.15. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.15 or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect
to this Section 8.15 shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and
may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company
shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against,
exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person liable for any Guaranteed Obligations prior to proceeding against
Guarantor hereunder or resort to any security or other means of collecting
payment. This Guaranty may only be amended by a writing signed and delivered
by Guarantor and the Company. Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it
shall not institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to
institute, any Action asserting that the Guaranty is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable
principles (whether considered an Action in equity or at law).
