(the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyers' calculation of (1) Net Working
Capital as of the Measuring Time (the "Closing Working Capital"), (2) Closing

Closing Statement that are denominated in any foreign currency shall be
converted into US Dollars at the mid-point US Dollar spot rate of exchange
applicable to such other foreign currency as quoted by the Wall Street Journal
as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date. The
Closing Statement shall also be prepared in accordance with the definitions of
"Net Working Capital" (and the component definitions thereof), "Closing
Indebtedness", "Transaction Expenses" and "Purchase Price", each as set forth
in this Agreement and all calculations in and relating to the Closing
Statement shall be made in accordance with and on a basis consistent with
GAAP, it being understood that (A) any dispute concerning any item contained
in the Financial Statements as it relates to the representations and
warranties contained in Article IV shall be resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.1 and (B) no adjustment resulting from the procedures
specified in this Section 2.4 will, in and of itself, entitle any Party to
assert any claim under Article IX (other than as a result of Party's failure
to actually pay an amount owed pursuant to the terms hereof). The Sellers'
Representative shall have thirty (30) days following its receipt of the
Closing Statement and the supporting detail (the "Review Period") to review
the same. On or before the expiration of the Review Period, the Sellers'
Representative shall deliver to Buyers a written statement accepting or
objecting to the Closing Statement (the "Closing Statement Response Notice")
containing, in the event the Sellers' Representative objects to any item on
the Closing Statement, the identity of each such item and reasonable
supporting details of such objection. Any items not indicated in the Closing
Statement Response Notice as being the subject of an objection shall be deemed
to have been accepted by the Sellers' Representative. If the Sellers'
Representative does not deliver a Closing Statement Response Notice to Buyers
within the Review Period, the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement in its entirety.

(b) Disputes. In the event that the Sellers' Representative objects to all or
any portion of the Closing Statement within the Review Period, Buyers and the
Sellers' Representative shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt to
resolve such objections. Any such objections



which cannot be resolved between Buyers and the Sellers' Representative within
thirty (30) days following Buyers' receipt of the Closing Statement Response
Notice shall be resolved in accordance with this Section 2.4(b). Should the
Sellers' Representative and Buyers not be able to resolve such objections set
forth in the Closing Statement Response Notice within the thirty (30) day
period described above, either Party may submit any remaining disputed items
to the Accounting Referee for review and resolution, with instructions to
complete the same as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty
(30) days of its engagement, and to resolve any objections in strict
conformity with this Section 2.4(b). The Accounting Referee shall act as an
accounting expert and not as an arbitrator and shall make all calculations in
accordance with the definitions of "Net Working Capital" (and the component
definitions thereof), "Closing Indebtedness" and "Transaction Expenses", each
as set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with and on a basis
consistent with GAAP. The Accounting Referee shall only have authority to make
determinations in respect of those specific items for which an objection has
been raised in the Closing Statement Response Notice, and all determinations
shall be based solely on the presentations of Buyers and the Sellers'
Representative and their respective representatives, and not by independent
review. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Referee: (i) shall be
bound by the terms and principles set forth in this Section 2.4(b), and (ii)
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either Party, in each case in the Closing Statement (in the case of
Buyers) or in the Closing Statement Response Notice (in the case of Sellers'
Representative). The Accounting Referee shall deliver a statement setting
forth its resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days of the submission
of the dispute to it, which resolution, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and not subject to appeal. The Closing
Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such determination by the
Accounting Referee. The fees and costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is
required, shall be payable by Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers'
Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting Referee that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Referee) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example,
if the Sellers' Representative submits a disputed item in the Closing
Statement Response Notice for $1,000, and if Buyers contest only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Sellers' Representative, and if the Accounting Referee

to Buyers in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, with any remainder of the
Working Capital Escrow Fund being distributed to the Sellers' Representative
for further distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the Sellers' Pro

immediately available funds, the amount of such excess. In the event the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount is owed to the Sellers by Buyers, Buyers shall pay
to the Sellers an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment Amount,
which amount shall be paid to the Sellers' Representative for further
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the Sellers' Pro Rata Share.
Any payment required under this Section 2.4(d) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment

2.5 Expense Amount. At the Closing, Buyers shall deposit into an account
designated by the Sellers' Representative (the "Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund") an amount equal to $250,000 (such amount, the "Sellers'

incurred by it in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder,
including, but not limited to, those duties and obligations listed in Section
2.4, Article IX, and Section 12.16. The Sellers' Representative Expense Amount
will be held by the Sellers' Representative for so long as the Sellers'
Representative determines is reasonably necessary for it to fulfill its
obligations and duties under this Agreement; provided, that following the
completion of all such obligations and duties and the satisfaction of all
expense reimbursements to which the Sellers' Representative is entitled in
connection therewith, the Sellers' Representative shall distribute to each
Seller its portion of any remaining amounts in the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund in accordance with the Sellers' Pro Rata Share.

2.6 Working Capital Escrow Fund.

(a) At the Closing, Buyers shall deposit the Working Capital Escrow Amount in
an account (the "Working Capital Escrow Fund") with Bank of America, National
Association (the



"Escrow Agent"). The Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be governed by the
terms of an escrow agreement to be entered into by and among Buyers, the
Sellers' Representative and the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow until the
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and shall be available to
settle certain contingencies as set forth in Section 2.4 of this Agreement.
Following the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and the
payment of such amount pursuant to Section 2.4(d), the remaining portion of
the Working Capital Escrow Fund (if any) will be distributable to the Sellers'
Representative for further distribution to the Sellers in accordance with the
Sellers' Pro Rata Share and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) All Parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes: (i) the right of the
Sellers to the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under
Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or
local Law, as appropriate; (ii) Buyers shall be treated as the owner of the
Working Capital Escrow Amount solely for Tax purposes, and all interest and
earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable to Buyers pursuant
to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.468B-8; (iii) if and to the extent any amount of the Working Capital Escrow
Amount is actually distributed to the Sellers, interest may be imputed on such
amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; and (iv) in the event
that the total amount of any interest and earnings earned on the Working
Capital Escrow Amount exceed the imputed interest, such excess amount shall be
treated as interest or other income and not as purchase price. Clause (iv) of
the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right of the Sellers to
the Working Capital Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned thereon
is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. All Parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns consistently with

Sellers' Representative the excess, if any, of (a) the amount, if any,
remaining in the Retention Escrow Fund (including any accumulated interest

Escrow Amount") plus the amount of any claims for Losses arising or resulting
from any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties
contained in Article III and Article IV or in Clause 5.1 and Clause 5.2 of the
Minority STRG Agreement asserted but not yet resolved ("Unresolved Claims")

anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall



distribute to the Sellers' Representative the excess, if any, of (a) the
amount, if any, remaining in the Retention Escrow Fund (including any
accumulated interest thereon) over (b) the amount of Unresolved Claims
existing on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, following the Closing Date and depletion
of the Buyer Deductible, in the event of any Loss arising or resulting from
any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties
contained in Article IV, the Buyers shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any such Losses from the then-remaining funds available in the Retention
Escrow Fund. CRI and the Sellers' Representative hereby agree to submit a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to cause the release of any such
applicable funds to an account designated in writing by CRI within two (2)
Business Days of notification by Buyers of any such Losses.

(c) All Parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes: (i) the right of the

result in the withdrawal of any exemption or relief previously claimed by any
such Company or Subsidiary thereof.

Property that is registered, filed or issued under the authority of any

any of the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries; or (ii) has received
any written or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, unwritten notice or claim
challenging



the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Owned Intellectual
Property and, to Sellers' Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any
claim that any of the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries do not own

(d) To Sellers' Knowledge (i) no Person has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated, or is currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise

conducted, has been authorized to be disclosed or has been actually disclosed
by any Company or Subsidiary thereof to any former or current employees of any
Company or Subsidiary thereof or any other Person other than pursuant to a
valid written agreement restricting the disclosure and use of such material
trade secret. All current and former employees, consultants and independent
contractors of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries who have
created, developed or conceived Owned Intellectual Property for or on behalf
any Company or Subsidiary thereof or who have had access to material trade
secrets of any Company or Subsidiary thereof have executed valid written
agreements pursuant to which such Persons have (i) agreed to hold all trade
secrets of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries in confidence both
during and after their employment or engagement, as applicable; and (ii)
presently assigned to a Company (or applicable Subsidiary thereof) all of such
Person's rights, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property
created, developed or conceived for the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries in the course of their employment or engagement by the Companies
(or their applicable Subsidiary thereof). To Sellers' Knowledge, no party to
any such agreements is in default or breach in any material respect of any
such agreements.

(g) The Companies and their respective Subsidiaries own or have a valid right
to access and use all computer systems, networks, hardware, Software,

Systems.

respective Subsidiaries who are bound by valid written agreements restricting
the disclosure and use of such source code. No Company or Subsidiary thereof
has disclosed or delivered to any escrow agent or any other Person (other than

Property rights therein to any third Person; (B) limits any Company's (or its
respective Subsidiary's) freedom of action with respect to the use or
distribution of any Owned Software; or (C) requires any Company or Subsidiary

thereof has paid (i) any perpetrator of any Data Breach or (ii) any third
party with actual or alleged information about a Data Breach, pursuant to a
request for payment from or on behalf of such perpetrator or other third
party.

(a) Each Company and Subsidiary thereof is not subject to any contractual
requirements under a Material Contract that, following the Closing, would
prohibit the Buyers or any Company or Subsidiary thereof from receiving,
accessing, storing or using Personal Information in the manner in which each
Company or Subsidiary thereof received, accessed, stored and used such
Personal Information prior to the Closing. The execution, delivery and

assistance relating to Buyers, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as
is reasonably necessary (i) for Sellers' financial reporting, Tax and
accounting matters, and/or (ii) to permit the Sellers' Representative and/or
the Sellers to defend or prosecute any claim arising hereunder; provided that
such access to information does not, in the Buyers' good faith judgment,
unreasonably disrupt its business and organization. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such access shall be permitted to the extent it would (a)
violate any Law, fiduciary duty, Order, contract or permit applicable to the
Buyers, the Companies or any Subsidiary (provided that the Buyers, the
Companies' and the Subsidiaries' shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to work in good faith with Seller's Representative to determine a
manner of providing such information or access in a manner that would not
violate such Law, duty, Order, contract or permit) or (b) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege.

7.10 Further Action. Each of the Parties hereto shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable and execute
and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.11 Employee Benefits.

(a) Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions
required so that eligible employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
receive service credit for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and level of benefits under any employee benefit plans and
arrangements maintained by Buyers in which they participate following the
Closing Date (the "Buyer Plans") except (x) with respect to benefit accrual
under qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, (y) to the
extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits or (z) to
the extent prior service is not credited to employees of Buyers under such
plans or arrangements, and (ii) (A) cause each applicable Buyer Plan to waive
any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work
requirements, other than those already in effect with respect to Continuing
Employees under the analogous welfare benefit plan maintained for the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (B) give each
Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing occurs
towards applicable deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments for
expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made.
During the twelve (12) month period following the Closing, Buyers shall take
all actions required so that the employees of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries who remain employed with Buyers immediately after the Closing
Date (the "Continuing Employees") receive (i) base compensation and annual
bonus opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than that
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyers and (ii) benefits
(excluding equity incentives and any benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension or retirement plan) that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to those benefits in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the date hereof.



(b) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, STR shall terminate the STR, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") unless
CRI provides written notice to STR that the 401(k) Plan shall not be
terminated. Unless CRI provides such written notice to STR, STR shall provide
CRI with evidence that the 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective as of no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date). STR shall have
taken all steps necessary to terminate the 401(k) Plan, and STR also shall
take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as CRI
may reasonably require.

(c) This Section 7.11 shall survive the Closing, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Buyers, the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this Section 7.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall
be construed to (i) create a right in any Business Employee to employment with
Buyers, the Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
shall restrict in any way the rights of the Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate such employee's services at
any time for any reason or no reason, (ii) limit the right of the Companies or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend or terminate any
Buyer Plan, any Plan or any other employee benefit plan, (iii) create any
third party rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever in any
Business Employee (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or any other
Person that is not a party to this Agreement, or (iv) be treated as
establishing or amending any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

7.12 No Solicitation. From immediately after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and through the Pre-Closing Period no Company will, and each
Company will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will not authorize or permit
any of its or their directors, partners, officers, managers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, representatives or advisors to, directly or indirectly,
take any action to solicit, encourage, support, facilitate, initiate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or accept any proposal or offer from, any
Person (other than Buyers and their advisors acting in such capacity)
concerning any Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement each
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, Affiliates, representatives and advisors to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any and all negotiations or discussions with any third
party regarding any proposal concerning any Acquisition Proposal, including
any access to any online or other datasites; provided that it is understood
and agreed that the Companies shall not, for the purposes of this Section
7.12, be required to terminate any confidentiality agreements with third
parties. From immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and through the Pre-Closing Period, each Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their directors, partners, officers, managers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, representative and advisors to, promptly (and
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) notify Buyers orally
and in writing of any proposal, offer, inquiry or notice concerning an
Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
proposal relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information
from a Person in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of
the Person making or submitting such proposal, offer or request, the material
terms thereof and a copy of any written proposal, offer or request) that is
received by a Company or any Affiliate, Subsidiary, Advisor or representative
of a Company. The Companies will keep Buyers informed on a reasonably current



basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours) of the status and details of any
material modifications to any such proposal, offer or request.

7.13 Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition.

(a) In order to induce Buyers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions, each STR Seller and STRG Seller covenants and agrees that,
during the period from the Closing Date until the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), such STR Seller and STRG Seller
shall not, and such STR Seller and STRG Seller shall cause its Affiliates not
to, (i) directly or indirectly, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce,
knowingly attempt to induce, solicit or attempt to solicit any Business
Employee or (ii) hire or otherwise retain any Business Employee as an
employee, consultant, independent contractor or worker; provided, however,
that it shall not be a violation of this Section 7.13(a) to (i) make general
solicitations in the public media that are not targeted at the Business
Employees; and (ii) hire the Business Employees as set forth on Schedule
7.13(a).

(b) In order to induce Buyers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions, each of the STR Sellers and STRG Seller covenants and agrees
that, during the Restricted Period, it shall not, and it shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, whether or not for compensation,
engage in a Restricted Business (as defined below) or compete with the
Business, or have any interest in any Person or business (whether as a
security holder, proprietor, agent, trustee, consultant, partner, member,
adviser or in a similar capacity) which engages or operates in a Restricted
Business or competes with the Business, in the United States, or any other
jurisdiction outside the United States in which STRG or any of its
Subsidiaries operates as of the Closing Date; provided that, during the
Restricted Period and after, such STR Seller and STRG Seller may own shares of
any company whose securities are publicly traded, so long as the securities so
owned do not constitute more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
securities of such company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Restricted Business" means the business of collecting, storing, processing
and analyzing data from and for the hospitality sector for the purpose of
providing market and data analytics, custom consulting work, performance
benchmarking, news services and market insights to the global hospitality
business sector and to others with an interest in the global hospitality
sector.

(c) In order to induce Buyers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions, each of the STR Sellers and STRG Seller covenants and agrees
that, during the Restricted Period it shall not, directly or indirectly,
solicit, knowingly interfere with, induce, or attempt to induce any past,
present or prospective customer, subscriber or supplier of a Company or any
Subsidiary of a Company as of the date of this Agreement (i) to cease doing
business in whole or in part, intentionally alter in any way, terminate or
breach his, her or its relationship or agreement with a Company or any
Subsidiary of a Company or (ii) for the purpose of selling or providing
products or services of the type which a Company or any Subsidiary of a
Company sold as of the date of this Agreement

(d) In the event that a STR Seller or STRG Seller breaches any material
provision of this Section 7.13, the period of time applicable to such
provisions that are breached shall be



automatically suspended upon the date of such breach and shall resume on the
date such breach ceases.

(e) Subject to Section 12.15, if the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator declares that any term or provision of this
Section 7.13 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court or
arbitrator making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or part or parts of the
wording, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

7.14 Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
to Sellers and the Companies and their respective successors and assigns the
full and timely performance of each Buyer's obligations (including all
indemnification and payment obligations) pursuant to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents required to be delivered hereunder, in each case
as the same is now or may hereafter be in effect. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that this guaranty is full, absolute and unconditional and is a
guaranty of performance and payment.

7.15 Reorganization. No later than two days prior to the Closing Date, STR
Sellers and STR shall consummate the Reorganization in a manner substantially
consistent with the terms set forth on Exhibit E. Sellers shall (a) provide to
Buyers copies of all documentation relating to the consummation of the

with respect to such documentation. In addition, promptly following the
incorporation of Holdings, the STR Sellers shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause Holdings to become a party to this Agreement by executing
that certain joinder agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F (the "Holdings Joinder").

7.16 Hendersonville Lease. During the Pre-Closing Period, STR shall, and the
STR Sellers shall cause STR to, negotiate in good faith with Moonlight
Properties, LLC to procure an amendment to the Hendersonville Lease, which
amendment shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to CRI and
the parties thereto, and will provide for the business terms set forth on
Schedule 7.16, among other agreed upon terms (the "Lease Amendment"). In the
event that the Lease Amendment has not been executed as of the Closing Date,
it is understood and agreed that either CRI or STR may, in its sole
discretion, elect to terminate the Hendersonville Lease, with such termination
to be effective on the day that is thirty-six (36) months from the Closing
Date, and the STR Sellers shall procure the understanding and agreement of
Moonlight Properties, LLC to the terms set forth in this Section 7.16.



7.17 Present IP Assignment. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Companies shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to procure an amendment to the Agreement
in Relation to Intellectual Property Rights, by and between MTC Media Limited

for the present assignment to a Company of



all right, title and interest in all Intellectual Property created by MTC

IX. INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification by Sellers.

(a) Subject to the limitations herein, STR Sellers and STRG Seller hereby
severally, but not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Buyer,
each Company, their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than STR
Sellers and STRG Seller) and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, representatives, members, partners and stockholders
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against any Loss arising from
(i) any breach or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties
contained in Article III, (ii) in the case of the STRG Seller, any breach or
inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Worsley
contained in Clause 5.1 or Clause 5.2 of the Minority STRG Agreement, (iii)
any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements of any STR Seller, STRG
Seller or Holdings contained in this Agreement, (iv) any breach of any of the
covenants or other agreements of any of the Companies to the extent
performance thereof is required in the Pre-Closing Period, (v) any breach of
any covenants or other agreements of STRG Seller or Worsley contained in the
Minority STRG Agreement to the extent performance thereof is required in the
Pre-Closing Period, or (vi) any Litigation commenced or threatened by Worsley
in connection with the disbursement of any



amounts owed to Worsley pursuant to this Agreement or the Minority STRG
Agreement (clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), collectively "Buyer
Losses"). For the avoidance of doubt, other than the Retention Escrow Amount
payable pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.7, STR Sellers and STRG
Seller shall have no liability for any Loss arising from any breach or
inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties contained in Article
IV and Buyer Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
such Losses shall be against the Retention Escrow Amount and the RWI Policy.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for
Buyer Losses arising from Fraud on the part of any STR Seller, STRG Seller or
Worsley, in no event shall (i) the STR Sellers and the STRG Seller be liable
for aggregate Buyer Losses in excess of the Purchase Price; and (ii) no
individual STR Seller shall be liable for Buyer Losses in excess of such
Seller's Pro Rata Share and STRG Seller shall not be liable for Buyer Losses
in excess of the aggregate of STRG Seller's Pro Rata Share and Worsley's Pro
Rata Share.

(c) If a Buyer Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification under this
Section 9.1, Buyers will promptly deliver to Sellers' Representative one or
more written notices of Buyer Losses (i) in the case of a breach or inaccuracy
of Article III, or a breach or inaccuracy of any representations and
warranties made by Worsley under Article 5 of the Minority STRG Agreement,
prior to the date that is 60 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and (ii) in the case of any breach of any covenant or
other agreement of a Seller contained in this Agreement or of Worsley or RCAS
contained in the Minority STRG Agreement, or in connection with any Litigation
commenced or threatened by Worsley in connection with the disbursement of any
amounts owed to Worsley pursuant to this Agreement or the Minority STRG
Agreement, at any time. STR Sellers and STRG Seller will have no liability for
a Buyer Loss under this Section 9.1 unless the written notice required by the
preceding sentence for such Buyer Loss is given by the applicable deadline, to
the extent failure to so notify has actually and materially prejudiced the STR
Sellers and STRG Seller. Any such written notice will state in reasonable
detail the basis for such Buyer Loss to the extent then known by Buyers and
the nature of the Buyer Loss for which indemnification is sought, and the
amount of the Buyer Loss claimed, if then known by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties. If such written notice (or an amended notice) states the
amount of the Buyer Loss claimed and Sellers' Representative notifies Buyers
that STR Sellers and STRG Seller do not dispute the claim described in such
notice or fail to notify Buyers within 20 Business Days after delivery of such
notice by Buyers whether STR Sellers and STRG Seller dispute the claim
described in such notice, the Buyer Loss in the amount specified in Buyers'
notice will be deemed admitted by the STR Sellers and STRG Seller, and the STR
Sellers and STRG Seller will indemnify the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Parties for such Buyer Loss in accordance with this Article IX. If Sellers'
Representative has timely disputed the liability of the STR Sellers and STRG
Seller with respect to such claim, Sellers' Representative and Buyers will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute for at least
30 days after delivery of Sellers' Representative's notice after which the
Parties may pursue any remedies available to them under this Agreement. During
such thirty (30) day period, Buyers shall allow the Sellers' Representative
and its representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable
in respect of the claim and Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist the Sellers' Representative's investigation by giving such



reasonable information and assistance (including reasonable access to the
Companies' premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy reasonably
necessary accounts, documents or records) as the Sellers' Representative or
any of its representatives may reasonably request. If a written notice does
not state the amount of the Buyer Loss claimed, such omission will not
preclude any Buyer Indemnified Party from recovering from the STR Sellers and
STRG Seller the amount of the Buyer Loss with respect to the claim described
in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided after it is determined.
In order to assert its right to indemnification under this Article IX, Buyers
will not be required to provide any notice except as provided in this Section
9.1(d).

(d) Following a Seller Liability Determination with respect to a Buyer Loss
pursuant to Section 9(a)(i) or Section 9(a)(ii), Buyers (on behalf of the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Party) shall recover such Buyer Loss, first, from
the Buyer Deductible, and second, only after the depletion of the Buyer
Deductible, from the Retention Escrow Amount, third, only after the depletion
of the Retention Escrow Fund, from the RWI Policy to the fullest extent of
coverage available thereof in accordance with the terms thereof, and
thereafter, severally from the breaching Seller(s) (with, for the avoidance of
doubt, STRG Seller providing indemnity for Worsley's Pro Rata Share), and such
breaching Seller(s) shall pay Buyers such Buyer Losses in cash, in each case,
in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Buyer Loss and within 10 days
following such Seller Liability Determination.

(e) Following a Seller Liability Determination with respect to a Buyer Loss
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv), Section 9.1(a)(v) or
Section 9.1(a)(vi), Buyers (on behalf of the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Party), shall recover such Buyer Loss severally from the breaching Seller(s)
(with, for the avoidance of doubt, STRG Seller providing indemnity for
Worsley's Pro Rata Share), and such breaching Seller(s) shall pay Buyers such
Buyer Losses in cash, in each case, in an aggregate amount equal to the
applicable Buyer Loss and within 10 days following such Seller Liability
Determination.

9.2 Indemnification by Buyers.

(a) Buyers hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless STR Sellers and
STRG Seller, their Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Companies) and
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents,
representatives, members, partners and stockholders (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") against any Loss arising from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of Buyers contained in
Article V; (ii) any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements of
Buyers contained in this Agreement; and (iii) any Sales Taxes of STR for Pre-
Closing Date Tax Periods, calculated as of the end of the Closing Date as if
the taxable year of the Companies and their Subsidiaries ended on the Closing
Date (clauses (i) through (iii), collectively, "Seller Losses").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for
Buyers' obligation to pay the Purchase Price to Sellers in accordance with
Section 2.2 and Seller Losses arising from Fraud on the part of Buyers, in no
event shall Buyers be liable for aggregate Seller Losses in excess of the
Purchase Price.



(c) If a Seller Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification under this
Section 9.2, Sellers' Representative will deliver to Buyers one or more
written notices of Seller Losses (i) in the case of a breach of any covenant
or other agreement of Buyers contained in this Agreement, at any time, (ii) in
the case of a breach or inaccuracy in any of the representations and
warranties of Buyers, prior to the date that is 60 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Buyers will not have any
liability under this Section 9.2 unless the written notices required by the
preceding sentence are given, to the extent failure to so notify has actually
and materially prejudiced the Buyers. Any such written notice will state in
reasonable detail the basis for such Seller Losses to the extent then known by
the STR Sellers and STRG Seller and the nature of the Seller Loss for which
indemnification is sought, and the amount of the Seller Loss claimed, if then
known by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties and shall include copies of all
relevant documents related to the claim. If such written notice (or an amended
notice) states the amount of the Seller Loss claimed and Buyers notify
Sellers' Representative that Buyers do not dispute the claim described in such
notice or fail to notify Sellers' Representative within 20 Business Days after
delivery of such notice by Sellers' Representative whether Buyers dispute the
claim described in such notice, the Seller Loss in the amount specified in
Sellers' Representative's notice will be admitted by Buyers, and Buyers will
pay the amount of such Seller Loss to Sellers' Representative (on behalf of
the applicable Seller Indemnified Party). If Buyers have timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, Buyers and Sellers' Representative will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute for at least
30 days after delivery of Buyers' notice, after which the Parties may pursue
any remedy available to them under this Agreement. During such thirty (30) day
period, the Sellers' Representative shall allow Buyers and their
representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise
to the claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the claim and the Sellers' Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Buyers' investigation by giving such reasonable
information and assistance as the Buyers or any of their representatives may
reasonably request; provided, however, that in no event will Sellers'
Representative or any STR Seller, STRG Seller or their respective Affiliates
be required to provide any information or assistance to the extent that
Sellers' Representative reasonably determines, in good faith, based upon
advice of counsel, that provision of such information or assistance would
result in a waiver of privilege. If a written notice does not state the amount
of the Seller Loss claimed, such omission will not preclude any Seller
Indemnified Party from recovering from Buyers the amount of Seller Loss with
respect to the claim described in such notice if any such amount is promptly
provided once determined. In order to assert its right to indemnification
under this Article IX, the STR Sellers and STRG Seller will not be required to
provide any notice except as provided in this Section 9.2(c).

(d) Buyers will pay the amount of any Seller Loss to Sellers' Representative
(on behalf of the applicable Seller Indemnified Party) in cash within ten (10)
Business Days following the determination of Buyers' liability for and the
amount of a Seller Loss (whether such determination is made pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this Section 9.2, by agreement between Sellers'
Representative and Buyers or by a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction).



9.3 Third Party Action.

(a) Buyers will give Sellers' Representative prompt written notice (a "Third
Party Claim Notice") of the commencement of any Litigation instituted by any
third party for which any Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably believes that it
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1 (any such third party
action or proceeding being referred to as a "Third Party Action"). The
complaint or other papers pursuant to which the third party commenced such
Third Party Action will be attached to such Third Party Claim Notice. The
failure to promptly deliver a Third Party Claim Notice will not affect any
Buyer Indemnified Party's right to indemnification except to the extent such
failure has actually and materially prejudiced the Sellers' Representative's
ability to defend successfully such Third Party Action. Buyers will deliver to
Sellers' Representative copies of all additional documents reasonably related
to or required to defend such Third Party Action promptly after receipt
thereof.

(b) Subject to Section 9.3(c), Sellers' Representative shall have 30 days
after its receipt of a complete Third Party Claim Notice to notify the Buyer
Indemnified Party that the Sellers' Representative has elected to contest and
defend any such Third Party Action on behalf of the applicable Buyer
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative shall
not have the right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Action to the extent
that: (i) such Third Party Action seeks the issuance of an injunction, the
specific performance of an obligation or similar equitable remedy, (ii) such
Third Party Action seeks damages in excess of the amount by which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX,
or (iii) if the subject matter of such Third Party Action relates to the
ongoing business of any Buyer Indemnified Party, which Third Party Action, if
decided against any Buyer Indemnified Party, would materially and adversely
affect the ongoing business of any Buyer Indemnified Party other than as a
result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement. If Sellers' Representative contests and defends such
Third Party Action, such contest and defense will be conducted by attorneys
retained and paid by the STR Sellers and STRG Seller and reasonably
satisfactory to Buyers. Any Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled at any
time, at its own cost and expense, to participate in such contest and defense
and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing; provided, however,
that, subject to this Section 9.3, the Sellers' Representative shall control
the defense of any such contest. If Sellers' Representative contests and
defends such Third Party Action, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties (i)
will cooperate with Sellers' Representative to the extent reasonably requested
by Sellers' Representative in the contest and defense of such Third Party
Action, including providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the
books, records and employees of such Buyer Indemnified Party if relevant to
the defense of such Third Party Action and the STR Sellers and STRG Seller
will not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
(subject to this Section 9.3); and (ii) will not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, discharge or compromise such Third Party Action without
the Sellers' Representative's prior written consent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as otherwise contemplated by Section 9.3(d). If
the Sellers' Representative assumes the defense of a Third Party Action, the
Sellers' Representative shall not concede, settle or compromise such Third
Party Action without Buyers' prior written consent; provided, however, that
the consent of Buyers shall not be required if (i) the STR Sellers and STRG
Seller pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such



Third Party Action, (ii) such settlement, compromise or discharge includes a
full, complete and unconditional release of Buyers and their Affiliates from
further liability with respect to such Third Party Action, and (iii) such
settlement, compromise or discharge does not require any commitment or
admission by Buyers or any of their Affiliates of any wrongdoing or violation
of Law or the rights of any Person (other than the making of any payments that
are paid in full by the applicable Seller Indemnifying Parties as provided in
the foregoing clause (i)) (the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii), the "Required Conditions").

(c) If Sellers' Representative chooses to contest and defend a Third Party
Action but (i) the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably determines in
good faith, based upon advice of counsel, that an actual conflict of interest
exists between the applicable Seller Indemnifying Parties and such Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to an issue that is significant to the defense
of a Third Party Action such that the applicable Seller Indemnifying Parties
(or the Sellers' Representative on their behalf) could not adequately
represent the applicable interests of the Buyer Indemnified Party or (ii) upon
petition by the Buyer Indemnified Party, the appropriate Governmental Entity
issues a final, non-appealable ruling that the applicable Seller Indemnifying
Parties (or the Sellers' Representative on their behalf) have failed or are
failing to conduct the defense of a Third Party Action in good faith, then, in
each case of clauses (i) and (ii), a Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled
to conduct its own defense and to be represented by attorneys of its own
choosing that are reasonably satisfactory to Sellers' Representative, all at
the STR Sellers' and STRG Seller' cost and expense.

(d) If the Sellers' Representative does not choose to contest and defend the
Third-Party Action within the timeframe provided for in this Section 9.3, or
the Sellers' Representative is not entitled to assume the Third-Party Defense
in accordance with this Section 9.3, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party
will be entitled to contest and defend the Third-Party Action, and such fees
and costs shall be indemnifiable Buyer Losses hereunder; provided, however,
that (i) the Sellers' Representative may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Action
but the Buyer Indemnified Party shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement, subject to the provisions herein; and (ii) the Sellers'
Representative shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. A Buyer
Indemnified Party may not concede, settle or compromise any Third Party Action
without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative; provided,
however, that the consent of Sellers' Representative shall not be required if
(i) a Third Party Action seeks the issuance of an injunction, the specific
performance of an obligation or similar equitable remedy, (ii) if a Third
Party Action seeks damages in excess of the amount by which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX,
or (iii) if the subject matter of a Third Party Action relates to the ongoing
business of any Buyer Indemnified Party, which Third Party Action, if decided
against any Buyer Indemnified Party, would materially and adversely affect the
ongoing business of any Buyer Indemnified Party other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified Party alone will be entitled to settle such
Third Party Action, but the STR Sellers and STRG Seller will not be bound by
any determination in connection with such Third Party Action for purposes of
this Agreement or any concession, settlement or compromise without the consent
of Sellers' Representative until the STR Sellers' and STRG Seller' liability
is otherwise determined in accordance with this Article IX.



9.4 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, except with respect to the matters covered by
Section 2.4, as set forth in Section 10.3, and, with respect to Buyer
Indemnified Parties, as provided in the RWI Policy, the Parties agree that,
from and after the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties to this Agreement and the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from
claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortuous conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) arising out of or based upon the matters set forth in
this Agreement are the indemnification and/or reimbursement obligations of the
Parties set forth in this Article IX and the RWI Policy, if applicable. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties hereby waives, from and
after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all
rights and claims for damages or otherwise it may have against any other Party
arising under, based upon or relating to this Agreement, any Transaction
Document, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith, any
applicable Law, common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX). EACH OF THE BUYER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE WHICH
LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH OF THE
BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF
UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN
CLAIMS. EACH OF THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE
BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FURTHER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM OR SEEK
RESCISSION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR HEREBY. The provisions
of this Section 9.4 shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action
under Section 14.11 to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties from bringing an action
based upon Fraud.

9.5 No Double Recovery; No Circular Recovery.

(a) For purposes hereof, any Losses shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss constituting
a breach of more than one provision.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the STR Sellers and STRG Seller hereby waive
and release any and all rights that any STR Seller and STRG Seller may have
under this Agreement or otherwise (including pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of any Company or Subsidiary thereof) for contribution or
reimbursement from any Company or Subsidiary thereof for any action taken or
not taken by a STR Seller or STRG Seller or such Company or such Subsidiary at
or prior to the Closing with respect to any matter that gives rise to a Buyer
Loss for which a Seller Liability Determination is made pursuant to this
Article IX (except to the extent covered by and paid in full out of payments
under the Tail Policy).



9.6 Tax Adjustment. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the STR
Sellers, STRG Seller and Buyers shall treat any payment made to a Buyer
Indemnified Party under this Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes, and shall complete
and file all Tax Returns consistent with such treatment.

9.7 Types of Losses. Notwithstanding any other term herein, neither STR
Sellers, STRG Seller, nor Buyers will be obligated to any other Person for any
exemplary, special, consequential or punitive damages, or Losses based thereon
relating to the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement in this Agreement or in any ancillary document, except to the extent
payable to a third party with respect to a Third Party Action.

9.8 Survival. Subject to the time limitations set forth in this Article IX,
all representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement,
and any other certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
will survive the Closing.

9.9 Mitigation. Each Party shall take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any of its Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Each of the Parties
hereto shall cooperate with the others with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other
Party hereunder, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

9.10 Calculation of Losses; Determination of Application. For the purposes of
calculating Losses under this Article IX, (i) such Losses shall be reduced by
the amount of any proceeds that the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable) actually recovers (reduced by
deductibles paid and the portion of any increase in deductibles, increase in
premiums, costs of collection and/or retro-premiums resulting from such
matter) pursuant to the terms of any insurance policies; provided, however,
such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable) shall
promptly reimburse Buyers or Sellers' Representative (as applicable) for any
subsequent recoveries from such sources if previously paid hereunder so as to
avoid a double recovery, in each case other than in respect of the RWI Policy;
(ii) such Losses shall be reduced by the amount of any prior or subsequent
proceeds actually recovered by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party (as applicable) from any other Person with respect to such Losses;
provided, however, such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party
(as applicable) shall promptly reimburse Buyers or Sellers' Representative (as
applicable) for any subsequent recoveries for such sources if previously paid
hereunder so as to avoid a double recovery, in each case other than in respect
of the RWI Policy; (iii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant and the calculation of any Losses in connection
therewith, shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other correlative terms of phrase contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation, warranty or covenant; provided that, the
foregoing clause (iii) shall not apply to (A) Section 4.8(ii); (B) and the
word "material" in defined terms including, without limitation, "Material
Contracts," "Material Customers," and "Material Vendors," and (iv) no
Indemnified Party\'s rights pursuant to this Article IX will be adversely
affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired or capable
of being acquired (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of any
matters expressly disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule



in accordance therewith and not indicated as being for informational purposes
only (or with a substantially similar indication)), by an Indemnified Party at
any time, whether before or after the execution or delivery of this Agreement
or the Closing, or by the waiver of any condition to Closing, and no
Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party
to be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

9.11 No Right of Setoff. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to withhold or set off any amount to which any Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of this Agreement against any amount or
obligation otherwise payable by any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement.



X. TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing, as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Parties;

(b) by either Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers and the Companies, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other, if the consummation of the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before January 1, 2020 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that if on such date the condition in Section 8.1(a), or in
connection with any legal restraint solely in respect of any Antitrust Law,
Section 8.1(b) has not been satisfied and all other conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Closing have been satisfied or
waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, such conditions would be satisfied or were then
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur), the Buyers, in their
sole discretion, may extend the Termination Date to April 1, 2020; provided,
further, that if on such extended date the condition in Section 8.1(a), or in
connection with any legal restraint solely in respect of any Antitrust Law,
Section 8.1(b) has not been satisfied and all other conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Closing have been satisfied or
waived (and, in the case of those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, such conditions would be satisfied or were then
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur), the Buyers, in their
sole discretion, may extend the Termination Date to July 1, 2020. The right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to
any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date;

(c) by the Companies and the Sellers, if neither the Companies nor the Sellers
are then in breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to
Buyers if there occurs a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
Buyers contained in this Agreement, and which breach, in the absence of a
cure, would cause either of the closing conditions set forth in Sections
8.3(a) or 8.3(b) to not be satisfied prior to the Termination Date; provided,
however, that such breach is either not capable of being cured or has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice thereof by the
Companies and Sellers to Buyers;



(d) by Buyers, if Buyers are not then in breach of any term of this Agreement,
upon written notice to Sellers' Representative if there occurs a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the STR Sellers, STRG Seller,
Holdings, Worsley or a Company contained in this Agreement or in the Minority
STRG Agreement, and which breach, in the absence of a cure, would cause either
of the closing conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) to not be
satisfied prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that such breach
is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after the giving of notice thereof by Buyers to the Companies;

(e) by Buyers, if the Minority STRG Agreement is terminated by RCAS or
Worsley; provided that such termination has continued until the earlier of (i)
the day immediately preceding the Termination Date and (ii) thirty (30) days
following the date of such termination, in each case without a similar
agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyers, for the
sale of Worley's STRG Interests having been executed by Worsley and CPS or its
Affiliate; or

(f) by either Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers and the Companies, on the
other hand, if a Governmental Entity shall have issued a final, non-appealable
Order, or taken any other action that is final and non-appealable, that
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the termination right under this
Section 10.1(f) shall not be available to any Party if such Order or action
was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform any of its
obligations under Section 7.3 of this Agreement.

10.2 Termination Fee. In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by
Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers and the Companies, on the other hand,
pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and at the time of such termination (x) the
condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) is not then satisfied, or (y) the
condition set forth in Section 8.1(b) is not then satisfied as a result of a
legal restraint being in effect solely in respect of any Antitrust Law; or
(ii) by Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers and the Companies, on the other
hand, pursuant to Section 10.1(f) in connection with any legal restraint
solely in respect of any Antitrust Law, and, at the time of such termination,
all other conditions to the obligations of Buyers to consummate the Closing in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 (excluding the conditions set forth in Section
8.1(a) and, in connection with any legal restraint solely in respect of any
Antitrust Law, Section 8.1(b)), have been satisfied or waived (and, in the
case of those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, such conditions would be satisfied or are capable of being satisfied
if the Closing were to occur at the time of such termination), then Buyers
shall, within three (3) Business Days following such termination, pay to the
Sellers' Representative for further distribution to the Sellers in accordance
with the Sellers' Pro Rata Share, by wire transfer to an account specified by
the Companies, a termination fee equal to $22,500,000 (the "Termination Fee").

10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Buyers, the
Companies, any Seller or the Sellers' Representative, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or
stockholders, and all rights and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease,
except that the provisions contained in



Section 7.2, Section 9.4, this Article X, and Article XII shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. Subject to Section 9.4, nothing in this Section
10.3 shall be deemed to release any Party from any liability for any Fraud or
willful and material breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement prior to such termination, and in the event of any such breach the
Parties hereto shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies available
under law or equity, but only to the extent expressly provided in Section
12.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Termination Fee is paid by
Buyers pursuant to Section 10.2, then the Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and whether for damages or equitable relief) of the Companies, the
STR Sellers, STRG Seller and their respective Affiliates and representatives
against Parent, Buyers and their respective Affiliates and representatives,
under the Transaction Documents or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, and (ii) upon the payment
by Buyers of the Termination Fee, none of Parent, Buyers or their respective
Affiliates and representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to our arising out of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that the nothing contained herein to the
contrary shall be deemed to release any Party from any liability for any fraud
or willful and material breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement

XI. TAX MATTERS

11.1 Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(a) Sellers' Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, (i) all
Tax Returns of the Companies for all Pre-Closing Date Tax Periods that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date and (ii) all Tax Returns of
Holdings for all Pre-Closing Date Tax Periods and Straddle Periods. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices of the
Companies except to the extent otherwise required by this Agreement or
applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due date for filing of each such
Tax Return, which in the case of Income Tax Returns shall be no later than 30
days prior to the due date for filing each such Tax Return, Sellers'
Representative shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to Buyers for their review and
comment. Sellers' Representative shall include in the Tax Return all
reasonable comments provided by Buyers with respect to any such draft copy.
Seller's Representative will cause (x) such Tax Return (as revised to
incorporate Buyers' reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will provide a
copy to Buyers and (y) timely payment in full to the applicable Taxing
Authority the amount of any Seller Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

(b) Buyers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns of the Companies for all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practices of the Companies, except to
the extent otherwise required by this Agreement or applicable Law. Reasonably
in advance of the due date for filing of each such Tax Return, which in the
case of Income Tax Returns shall be no later than 30 days prior to the due
date for filing each such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax
Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to Sellers'
Representative for its review and comment. Buyers shall include in the Tax
Return all reasonable comments provided by Sellers with respect to any



such draft copy. Buyers will cause such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate
Sellers' Representative's reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will
provide a copy to Sellers' Representative. Not later than ten days prior to
the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Return for a
Straddle Period, Buyers and Sellers' Representative shall cause the Escrow
Agent to distribute to Buyers from the Tax Escrow Fund an amount sufficient to
pay any Seller Taxes described in clause (c) of the definition thereof with
respect to such Tax Return. Not later than five days prior to the due date for
payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, Sellers shall pay Buyers the
amount of any Seller Taxes with respect to such Tax Return (other than Seller
Taxes for which amounts were distributed to Buyers from the Tax Escrow Fund
pursuant to the preceding sentence).

(c) For purposes of determining the portion of any Taxes for a Straddle Period
that are Seller Taxes, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of each Company
ended with (and included) the Closing Date; provided that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of any Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

(iii) in the case of VAT, the relative VAT chargeable on supplies made by the
supplier, and allowing for VAT on supplies made to the supplier, on or before
the Closing Date.

11.2 Cooperation. Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate fully as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a "Tax
Proceeding") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,
operations or activities of any Company. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Sellers further agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be



necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
Buyers or any Company (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding the above, the control and
conduct of any Tax Proceeding that is a Third Party Action shall be governed
by Section 9.3.

11.3 Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of the
Transfer Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Minority STRG Agreement, if any. Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in
good faith (i) in the timely filing of any Tax Returns and timely submission
of stock transfer forms with respect to such Transfer Taxes and (ii) to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes, provided that the Buyers shall be responsible for (x)
calculating any Transfer Taxes that are payable in the United Kingdom as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Minority
STRG Agreement and (y) making any application in relation to, and filing the
stock transfer forms and any other documents in connection with, such Transfer
Taxes payable in the United Kingdom.

11.4 References. For purposes of this Article XI, all references to a Company
shall also include any Subsidiary of any Company.

11.5 Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) The Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be allocated as
follows: (i) 32% of the Allocable Purchase Price shall be payable in respect
of the STRG Interests by CPS; and (ii) 68% of the Allocable Purchase Price
minus $6,000,000 (which amount represents the net sum of the Tax Liability
Amount and the Tax Gross-Up Amount in accordance with the calculation of the
Purchase Price) shall be payable in respect of the STR Interests by CRI.

(b) Buyers shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price allocable to the
STR Interests as determined by Buyers (and any additional amounts representing
consideration paid by Buyers for the purchase of the STR Interests, if any)
among the assets of STR in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, as appropriate) (the "STR Asset Allocation"). Buyers shall
deliver such STR Asset Allocation to Sellers' Representative within 120 days
after the Closing. Buyers and Sellers' Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate to resolve any disagreements with the STR
Asset Allocation in good faith. To the extent agreed by Buyers and Sellers'
Representative, Buyers, STR, and STR Sellers and their respective Affiliates
shall report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with such agreed STR Asset Allocation and shall not take
any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such agreed STR Asset Allocation unless required to do so by
applicable Law; provided, however, that if Buyers and Sellers' Representative
are unable to resolve any disputed item, then none of the Buyers, Sellers'
Representative, STR and STR Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall be
required pursuant hereto to file any Tax Returns or otherwise take any
position consistent with such allocation. At Buyers' request, STR Sellers (and
STR Sellers' spouses if such Sellers or Sellers' spouses are resident of a
community property state) shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and
deliver all such documents, forms and other information as may be required to
prepare such STR Asset Allocation.



11.6 Transaction Treatment. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes, (a) the Reorganization
constitutes a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code
and (b) CRI's purchase of the STR Interests from Holdings constitutes an
"applicable asset acquisition" within the meaning of Section 1060(c) of the
Code. The Parties and their Affiliates shall report the Reorganization and
such purchase consistent with the foregoing treatment on all Tax Returns and
shall not take any actions inconsistent therewith unless otherwise required by
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

11.7 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all Tax allocation, sharing or indemnity
agreements or arrangements between any Company and any other Person shall be
terminated as of the Closing and from and after the Closing, no Company shall
be obligated to make any payment pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement
for any past or future period.



XII. GENERAL

12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement,
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, will each pay all
expenses incurred by each of them (and, in the case of Sellers, by the
Companies) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including legal, accounting and consulting fees and expenses incurred in
negotiating, executing and delivering this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

12.2 Further Assurances. On and after the Closing Date, the Parties will, and
will cause their Affiliates to, from time to time after the Closing, deliver
to the other Parties such documents and instruments reasonably necessary or
desirable to perfect or clarify the sale of the Equity Interests and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and do such other things as may be
reasonably requested by the other Parties (and at such other Parties' expense)
in order to more effectively consummate or document the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. From time to time after the Closing, the
Parties shall cause their appropriate employees and representatives to provide
the other Parties with information and data reasonably requested by such other
Parties that is necessary or useful to the requesting Parties in connection
with the current or former operation of the Business, or in connection with
the preparation of accounting and related reports and all Tax Returns with
respect to the Companies. The requesting Parties shall reimburse all
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the responding Parties in
connection therewith.

12.3 Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together with all
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties. This Agreement may not be amended,
nor may any provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or agreement under this Agreement be waived, except (a) in
the case of any such amendment, in a writing executed by Buyers and Sellers'

by (i) Buyers (if such waiver is sought to be enforced against Buyers) or (ii)
Sellers' Representative (if such waiver is sought to be enforced against any
STR Seller, the STRG



Seller or Holdings). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither
the failure nor any delay by any Person in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power
or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. In addition,
no course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this
Agreement will be deemed effective to modify or amend any part of this
Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of
this Agreement. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not
alternative.

consent of the other Parties, except that each Buyer may (a) assign any of its
rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of such Buyer or (b) collaterally
assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any of its lenders, in each
case so long as such Buyer (i) remains responsible for the performance of all
of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) provides Sellers with prior
written notice of such assignment. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
and all of the provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

12.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in Section
7.6, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement confers any rights or
remedies upon any Person that is not a Party or permitted assign of a Party.

12.7 Signatures; Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one Party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and
the same instrument. A facsimile, electronic or .pdf signature will be
considered an original signature.

12.8 GOVERNING LAW. THE DOMESTIC LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES, OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO
ITS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
WILL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN THOUGH UNDER
SUCH JURISDICTION'S CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW ANALYSIS, THE SUBSTANTIVE
LAW OF SOME OTHER JURISDICTION WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY.

12.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits
to the jurisdiction of any court, federal or State, located in the State of
Delaware in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and agrees that any
such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought only in such courts;
provided, however, that such consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose
referred to in this Section 12.9 and shall not be deemed to be a general
submission to the jurisdiction of said courts or in the State of Delaware
other than for such purpose. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably



waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

12.10 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the subject matter of this Agreement, including the Business, is unique, that
the other Parties may be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at Law would
not be adequate to compensate such other Parties not in default or in breach.
Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other Parties will be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to
which they may be entitled, at Law or in equity.

12.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

12.12 Construction. The Parties and their respective counsel have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In addition, each
of the Parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has been advised by
experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in
connection with the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. The Parties
intend that each representation, warranty and agreement contained in this
Agreement will have independent significance. If any Party has breached any
representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the
Party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement. The
headings preceding the text of articles and sections included in this
Agreement and the headings to the schedules and exhibits are for convenience
only and are not to be deemed part of this Agreement or given effect in
interpreting this Agreement. References to sections, articles, schedules or
exhibits are to the sections, articles, schedules and exhibits contained in,
referred to or attached to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. The
word "including" means "including without limitation." The word "or" when used
in a list shall not indicate that the listed items are exclusive of each
other. The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender or the singular or
plural form of words will not limit any provisions of this Agreement. A
statement that an item is listed, set forth, disclosed or described means that
it is correctly listed, set forth, disclosed or described, and a statement
that a copy of an item has been delivered means a true and correct copy of the
writing has been delivered, including, in each case, in the electronic data
site maintained for the transactions contemplated hereby. Any reference in
this Agreement to STR shall mean (a) STR, Inc., a Tennessee corporation,



prior to the Reorganization, (b) STR, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability
company, following the Reorganization, and (c) STR as operating under any
other name following the Closing as shall be determined by the Buyers (or any
successors thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall
also apply to any reference in this Agreement to "a Company", "the Companies",
"either Company" or any similar reference, to the extent such reference
applies to both STR and STRG. Wherever this Agreement requires a Seller to
take any action (or to refrain from taking any action), such requirement shall
be deemed to involve an undertaking on the part of the STR Sellers to require
Holdings to take (or refrain from taking) such action.

12.13 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

12.14 Confidentiality. STR Sellers and STRG Seller expressly acknowledge and
agree that the records, books, data, and other confidential information
concerning the products, services, accounts, client development (including
customer and prospect lists), sales activities and procedures, promotional and
marketing techniques, plans and strategies, financing, development and
expansion plans and credit and financial data concerning customers and
suppliers and other information involving the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries obtained by a STR Seller or STRG Seller through such STR Seller's
or STRG Seller's past or future affiliation with the Companies their
respective Subsidiaries is confidential and in the nature of trade secrets and
are valuable, special and unique assets of the Companies their respective
Subsidiaries, access to knowledge of which is essential to preserve the good
will and going business value of the Companies their respective Subsidiaries
for the benefit of Buyers and their Affiliates. In recognition of the highly
competitive nature of the industry in which the Business will be conducted,
STR Sellers and STRG Seller further agree that all knowledge and information
described in the preceding sentence not in the public domain (unless such
knowledge and information is in the public domain as a result of a breach of
this Agreement or any other confidentiality agreement) and heretofore or in
the future obtained by any STR Seller or STRG Seller as a result of such STR
Seller's or STRG Seller's past affiliation with the Companies their respective
Subsidiaries shall be considered confidential information (collectively, the
"Confidential Information"). In recognition of the foregoing, STR Sellers and
STRG Seller hereby agree that for a period of five years from the Closing
Date, STR Sellers and STRG Seller will not disclose, or cause to be disclosed,
any of the Confidential Information to any Person for any reason or purpose
whatsoever, except and to the extent such disclosure is required by Law or
appropriate court order and written notice thereof, if practicable, is
provided to Buyers not less than ten Business Days prior to such disclosure,
nor shall any STR Sellers or STRG Seller make use of any of the Confidential
Information, other than information that is in the public domain (unless such
information is in the public domain as a result of a breach of this Agreement
or any other confidentiality agreement), for such STR Seller's or STRG
Seller's own purposes or for the benefit of any Person (except Buyers or their
Affiliates) under any circumstances.

12.15 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction due to any applicable Law or public policy
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or



unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination
shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such
court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
Parties shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term.

12.16 Sellers' Representative. By the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Holdings and each STR Seller and STRG Seller hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Randell Smith ("Sellers' Representative"), as the
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG
Seller with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of
Sellers with respect to the transfer of the Equity Interests owned by Sellers
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and to act on
behalf of Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller in any litigation or
arbitration involving the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby, to take or refrain from taking any action by a Seller
under this Agreement following the Closing and to do or refrain from doing all
such further acts and things, and execute all such documents as Sellers'
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the power:

(a) to act for STR Sellers and STRG Seller with regard to matters pertaining
to indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of STR Sellers and STRG Seller and to
transact matters of litigation;

(b) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates and
documents that Sellers' Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents;

(c) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of Holdings,
STR Sellers and STRG Seller that Sellers' Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of the
Transaction Documents as fully and completely as Holdings, STR Sellers and
STRG Seller could do if personally present; and

(d) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under the
Transaction Documents.

The appointment of Sellers' Representative shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and Buyers, and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of Sellers'
Representative in all matters referred to herein. All notices required to be
made or delivered by Buyers after the Closing to Sellers shall be made to
Sellers' Representative for the benefit of Sellers and shall discharge in full
all such notice requirements of Buyers to Sellers with respect thereto.
Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller hereby confirm all that Sellers'
Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of his appointment as
Sellers' Representative of Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller. Sellers'
Representative shall act for Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller on all of
the matters set forth in the Transaction Documents



in the manner Sellers' Representative believes to be in the best interest of
Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller and consistent with the obligations
under the Transaction Documents, but Sellers' Representative shall not be
responsible to Holdings, STR Sellers and STRG Seller for any Losses Holdings,
STR Sellers and STRG Seller may suffer by the performance by Sellers'
Representative of his duties under the Transaction Documents, other than
Losses arising from willful violation of Law by Sellers' Representative or
gross negligence in the performance by Sellers' Representative of his duties
under this Section 12.16.

(e) Buyers understand that the Companies and Sellers have been represented by
Baker Donelson as counsel to the Companies and Sellers, including in the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and that Baker Donelson has not represented
any director or employee of the Companies or Sellers in the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Buyers acknowledge and agree, on behalf of themselves and
their Affiliates, that Baker Donelson may after the Closing represent the
Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and/or their Affiliates in matters
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
representation of such Persons in matters related to Section 2.3 and to post-
Closing claims made by Buyers and any other Parties under the indemnification
provisions in this Agreement and other claims that may arise out of or relate
to this Agreement. Buyers hereby acknowledge, on behalf of themselves and
their Affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained
information relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the
reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it
hereby waives any conflict arising out of such future representation with
respect to the matters contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyers, for themselves and their Affiliates, and its and
its Affiliates' respective successors and assigns, agrees that any privilege
attaching as a result of Baker Donelson's engagement and representation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will
survive the Closing and remain in effect, and from and after the Closing such
privilege shall be controlled by the Sellers (and not by Buyers or the
Companies).

12.17 Seller Release. Effective as of the Closing, each of STR Sellers, STRG
Seller and Holdings, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including its
officers, directors, employees, partners, agents, attorneys, accountants,
advisors and representatives (collectively, the "Seller Releasors") hereby
releases and forever discharges each Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries
and each of its past and present officers, directors, employees, partners,
agents, attorneys, accountants, advisors and representatives (individually, a
"Releasee" and collectively, the "Releasees") from any and all claims,
demands, actions, arbitrations, audits, hearings, investigations, litigations,
suits (whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or informal),
causes of action, orders and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, contingent or otherwise, both at law and in equity,
of any kind, character or nature whatsoever ("Claims") which any of the Seller
Releasors now has, has ever had, or may have in the future against the
respective Releasees however arising and that arise out of Seller's indirect
or direct ownership of any Ownership Interest in any Company or Subsidiary
thereof, including the Equity Interests, or that arise out of the transactions
contemplated by the Bill of Sale and Release and Intellectual Property
Assignment, each by and between STR and STR Sector Analysis, LLC, and dated as
of September 24, 2019, as amended as of the date hereof. The scope of the
release shall include all Claims (a) relating to a breach of any



fiduciary duty owed by the Releasees to any Company and arising from any such
Ownership Interest or (b) relating to any breach of the Organizational
Documents of any Company or Subsidiary thereof, as such may be amended;
provided, however, that the foregoing release and discharge shall not release
(i) Buyers of their obligations or liabilities to such Seller pursuant to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (ii) any benefits under

programs provided by any Company or Subsidiary thereof arising prior to the

that they are expressly waiving all Claims against the Releasees covered by
this Section 12.17, including those Claims that they may not know of or
suspect to exist which, if known, may have materially affected the decision to
provide this Agreement, and Holdings and each STR Seller and STRG Seller
expressly waive any rights under applicable Law that provide to the contrary.
Holdings and each STR Seller and STRG Seller hereby ratify each and every
amendment to the Organizational Documents of any Company and Subsidiary
thereof and each and every merger of any Company or Subsidiary thereof or any
of their respective predecessors effected at a time prior to the Closing when
Holdings and each STR Seller and STRG Seller owned any Ownership Interests of
such Company (or Subsidiary thereof) or any such predecessor.
