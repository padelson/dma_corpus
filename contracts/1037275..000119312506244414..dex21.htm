which will be no later than the fifth Business Day

by the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and such Bylaws.

1.7 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors and
officers of Sub, as constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Common Stock,
Parent, Sub or any other Person:

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be converted into
the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.10(c), an
amount of cash equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
automatically be cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders
thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender of
Certificates in accordance with Section 1.10.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of Parent, be converted into and
become one share of common stock of the Surviving  



 

-9-  Corporation (and the shares of Surviving Corporation into which the shares
of Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the
Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership
of shares of Sub common stock will evidence ownership of such shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company and Parent_. At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

(c)  _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to
specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all
calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class
or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like changes.

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Per-Share Cash Amount provided for in Section 1.8(a)(i), but shall
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment
thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (but only after the value therefor has been agreed
upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the
Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to
receive the Per-Share Cash Amount as if such shares never had been Dissenting
Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as
promptly as reasonably practicable after) the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions set forth in Section 1.10, the total amount of cash consideration
to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under Section 1.8(a)
as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall
be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable to
such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)). The Company shall give Parent (i)
reasonably prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL and received by the Company,
and (ii) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as otherwise required under the applicable provisions of
the DGCL, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of
any Dissenting Shares.

1.9 _Unvested Company Shares; Company Options_.

(a) _Unvested Company Shares_. The payout of cash pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 1.8(a) in exchange for Company Common Stock that immediately prior to
the Effective Time was restricted, not fully vested or subject to Repurchase
Rights ("Unvested Company Shares") shall be  



 

-10-  subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or Repurchase Rights
that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or
at the Effective Time. Therefore, cash otherwise payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a)(i) in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock that immediately
prior to the Effective Time was restricted or not fully vested
("Unvested Cash") shall not be payable by Parent (through the Paying Agent)
at the Effective Time, and shall instead be paid out directly by Parent on the
date that such share of Company Common Stock would have become vested under
the vesting schedule in place for each such share immediately prior to or at
the Effective Time (subject to the conditions and other terms of such vesting
schedule, and provided that if such conditions and terms are not satisfied and
vesting ceases to continue at any point after the Effective Time, no cash
payments shall be made, except the repurchase price described below, with
respect to the Unvested Company Shares). All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 1.9(a) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so
distributed will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All
outstanding Repurchase Rights with respect to Unvested Company Shares that
the Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned
to Parent by virtue of the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by
Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Repurchase Rights
may be exercised by Parent with regard to the Unvested Cash into which such
Unvested Company Shares have been converted by paying to the former holder
thereof the repurchase price in effect for each such former Unvested Company
Share subject to that Repurchase Right immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, no Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may
be made subject to any encumbrance, sold, assigned or transferred (including
any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be
taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt
or other liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person
of such Unvested Cash in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all Company Options (other than
outstanding Company Options held by non-employee directors (each a "Non-
Employee Director Option")) then outstanding under each Company Option Plan,
and the non-plan Company Options, each as described in _Schedule 2.2(b)_ to
the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.11. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each vested Non-
Employee Director Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after taking into account any acceleration of such Company
Options pursuant to the terms of the plan pursuant to which such Non-Employee
Director Options were granted) shall be automatically net exercised with no
action on the part of the holder thereof and each such holder shall be
entitled to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.10(c), an
amount of cash, without interest, equal to the difference between (i) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Non-Employee Director Option _multiplied by_ (B) the Per-Share Cash Amount,
_less_ (ii) the product of (A) number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Non-Employee Director Option _multiplied by_ (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, all such
Non-Employee Director Options shall automatically be cancelled and no longer
deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the amount resulting from the
calculation above, without interest, upon surrender of their option
documentation in accordance with Section 1.10.

1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint U.S.
Bank, N.A. or another reputable national bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as paying agent under
this Agreement for the purpose of distributing the aggregate cash
consideration distributable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) (other than shares
subject to  



 

-11-  Section 1.9(a)) and Section 1.9(b) upon surrender of the Certificates or
applicable option documentation in accordance with this Section 1.10. 

(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, or a
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, shall deposit or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
1, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, the cash payable
pursuant to Sections 1.8(a) and 1.9(b).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, (and in no
event no more than ten Business Days after the date of the Effective Time)
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of a certificate
or certificates (or holders of Non-Employee Director Options) ("Certificates")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal (that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and shall contain such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company), and (ii)
instructions for use of such letter of transmittal in effecting surrender of
Certificates in exchange for such cash. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
the relevant option documentation with respect to Non-Employee Director
Options) to the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or any other evidence of transfer that the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of the transfer of Company Common Stock held
in book-entry form) together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, each holder
of such Certificate (or Non-Employee Director Option) shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute
to such holder, a check for the cash amount that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or 1.9(b) in respect of such Certificate or
Non-Employee Director Option, and the Certificate or relevant option
documentation so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates and option agreements held by former
directors of the Company will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash pursuant
to Sections 1.8(a) or 1.9(b).

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a), Section 1.8(d), Section 1.9(a) or Section 1.9(b).

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement.

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Paying Agent which
have not been delivered to any holders of Certificates pursuant to this
Article 1 within one year after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid to
Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate or applicable option
documentation who has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures
set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.10(c) shall look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned  



 

-12-  property, escheat and similar Legal Requirements) for its claim, only as a
general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to such holder
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or Section 1.9(b). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior
to the third anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the merger consideration contemplated by Section 1.8(a)
or 1.9(b) in respect of such Certificate or option documentation would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid or
payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be so paid or
payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 1.

1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required pursuant
to Section 1.8(a) or 1.9(b) in respect of such Certificate or applicable
option documentation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum
as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent and/or any of their respective representatives or agents with respect
to such Certificate.

1.13 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
shares deliverable upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant
to this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant
to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, any
Company Options or any Certificates, such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code, any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law, or pursuant to other
applicable Judgments. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered and paid to such holders in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

1.14 _Tax Consequences_. Parent makes no representations or warranties to the
Company or to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options regarding
the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to the Company or
any such holder of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that
the Company and such holders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of the  



 

-13-  Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or desirable
to accomplish such purpose or acts so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

a corporation or other business entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each
Subsidiary has the corporate or similar power to own its properties and to

exemption from electronic filing. All such required forms,
statements, schedules,  



 

-17-  and reports (including those that Company may file subsequent to the date of

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected prior to the date of
this Agreement by a subsequently filed Company SEC Report. Except to the

except that the unaudited interim financial statements may not contain
footnotes and were or are subject to immaterial and recurring year-end
adjustments. The balance sheet (including any related notes thereto) of the
Company as of September 30, 2006 (the "Company Balance Sheet Date") contained
in the Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance
Sheet."

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
Liabilities of the type that would be required to be disclosed in the

period ended September 30, 2006 (including footnotes), (ii) liabilities
incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices which are of the type which
individually or in the aggregate, are not material in nature or amount and do
not result from any breach of Contract, tort or violation of any Legal
Requirement, and (iii) the fees and expenses of the Companys
representatives, including its investment bankers, attorneys and accountants
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as reflected in the Financial Statements, neither the Company

Accounting Standards No. 5 ("Statement No. 5") issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board in March 1975) that are not adequately provided for
in the Company Balance Sheet as required by Statement No. 5\. The Financial
Statements comply in all material respects with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2, 98-9, EITF 00-21 and

as well as any comment letters or similar written correspondence received by
the Company from the SEC since December 31, 2002, and any written responses

and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the "principal
executive officer" and the "principal financial officer" of the Company

asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
There are no material weaknesses, or series of multiple
significant deficiencies that are reasonably likely to collectively represent

ethics.

and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over

meaning of Regulation S-X since December 31, 2001.

(j) Since December 31, 2002, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Companys knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor,

otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, in each case,
regarding improper, wrongful or fraudulent accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary or their
respective internal accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the
Companys financial statements. To the Companys knowledge, no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any Subsidiary, has reported to the Company Board or any

listed in _Schedule 2.10(h)_ or _Schedule 2.10(aa)_ to the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the "Company IP Rights Agreements") and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in the modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of, or
acceleration of any payments with respect to the Company IP
Rights Agreements, or give any non-Company party to any Company IP Rights
Agreement the right to do any of the foregoing. Following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation (as wholly owned by Parent) will be permitted to
exercise all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries rights under the Company
IP Rights Agreements to the same extent the Company and its Subsidiaries would
have been able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not

other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries would otherwise be required to pay.

(k) There are no royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than salaries payable
to employees, consultants and independent contractors not contingent on or

possession, license-in, license-out, sale, marketing, advertising or
disposition of any Company-Owned IP Rights by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(l) To the Companys knowledge, there is no unauthorized use, unauthorized
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Company-Owned IP Rights by
any third party, including any employee or former employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has brought any
action, suit or proceeding for infringement or misappropriation of any

allegation or claim of infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual
Property right of any third party or which contests the validity, ownership or
right of the Company or any Subsidiary to exercise any Intellectual
Property right. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has in the five (5)
years prior to the date of this Agreement received any written communication

under any third party patent rights in connection with an allegation that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries requires or  



 

-26-  may require a license to any such patents to conduct the business as
currently conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(n) The operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such

use of any Company Product and (ii) the Companys or any Subsidiarys use of
any product, device or process used in the business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries including use in research and development activities currently
conducted by the Company or any Subsidiary as evidenced by the Companys or a
Subsidiarys documentation, does not infringe or misappropriate the
Intellectual Property of any third party (except that with respect to patents
these representations are made to the Companys knowledge) and does
not constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under any Legal
Requirements, other than infringement or misappropriation resulting solely
from use of commercial third party products. To the Companys knowledge, there
is no substantial basis for a claim that the design, development,
manufacturing, reproduction, marketing, licensing, sale, offer for sale,
importation, distribution, provision and/or use of any Company Product or the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is infringing
or has infringed on or misappropriated any Third Party Intellectual Property
Rights.

(o) There is no Proceeding or Judgment (i) restricting in any manner the use,
transfer, or licensing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
Company-Owned IP Right or any Company Product, or which affects the validity,
use or enforceability of any such Company-Owned IP Right or Company Product,
or (ii) restricting the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in order to accommodate any Third Party Intellectual Property
Rights.

(p) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any opinion of counsel
that any Company Product or the operation of the business of the Company or
any Subsidiary, as previously or currently conducted, including research and
development activities currently conducted by the Company or any Subsidiary as
evidenced by the Companys or a Subsidiarys documentation, infringes or
misappropriates any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights.

(q) The Company and each Subsidiary has and enforces a policy of securing
from all current and former consultants, employees and independent contractors

practice, creation or development of any Company-Owned IP Rights or Company
IP Rights that are purported to be owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unencumbered and unrestricted exclusive ownership of all such
third partys Intellectual Property in such contribution that the Company or
any Subsidiary does not already own by operation of law and such third party
has not retained any rights or licenses with respect thereto. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and each Subsidiary has and enforces a policy of
obtaining proprietary information and invention disclosure and assignment
agreements from all current and former employees and consultants of the
Company and each Subsidiary. The Company has delivered to Parent copies of its
form invention assignment agreements for employees, contractors and
consultants and all invention assignment agreements with current and former
employees, contractors and consultants that materially deviate from such
forms.

(r) To the Companys knowledge, no current or former employee, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary: (i) is in violation
of any term or covenant of any Contract relating to employment, invention
disclosure, invention assignment, non-disclosure or non-competition or any
other Contract with any other party by virtue of such
employees, consultants or independent contractors being employed by, or
performing services for, the Company or any Subsidiary or using trade secrets
or proprietary information of others without permission; or (ii) has developed
any

agreement under which such employee, consultant or independent contractor has
assigned or otherwise granted to any third party any rights (including
Intellectual Property rights) in or to such technology, software or other
copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work.

(s) To the Companys knowledge, the employment of any employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary or the use by the Company or any Subsidiary of the services
of any consultant or independent contractor does not subject the Company or
any Subsidiary to any material liability to any third party for improperly
soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor to work for
the Company or any Subsidiary, whether such liability is based on contractual
or other legal obligations to such third party.

(t) No current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company or any Subsidiary has any license or ownership interest whatsoever in
or with respect to any Company-Owned IP Rights or any other Company IP Rights
that are purported to be owned by the Company or any Subsidiary created by any
such employee, consultant or independent contractor for the Company or a
Subsidiary (other than any Intellectual Property that is the subject of an
express license).

(u) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all confidential or non-public
information included in the Company IP Rights ("Confidential Information").

terms of a written agreement or other legal binding arrangement between the
Company or a Subsidiary and such third party. All use, disclosure or
appropriation of Confidential Information by the Company and its Subsidiaries
not owned by the Company or any Subsidiary has been pursuant to the terms of a
written agreement between the Company or such Subsidiary and the owner of
such Confidential Information, or is otherwise lawful.

(v) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (i) incorporated Open Source
Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials with, the Company IP Rights
or Company Products; (ii) distributed Open Source Materials in conjunction
with any Company IP Rights or Company Products; or (iii) used Open Source
Materials, in such a way that, with respect to (i) or (ii), creates
obligations for the Company or such Subsidiary with respect to any Company-
Owned IP Rights or grants to any third party any rights or immunities under
any Company-Owned IP Rights (including using any Open Source Materials that
require, as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution of such Open
Source Materials that other software incorporated into, derived from or
distributed with such Open Source Materials be (A) disclosed or distributed
in source code form, (B) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative
works, or (C) be redistributable at no charge).

(w) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liability (and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no legitimate basis for any present or
future Proceeding against the Company or any Subsidiary giving rise to any
material Liability) arising from Company Products provided by or through the
Company or any Subsidiary to customers on or prior to the Closing Date not
conforming to applicable contractual provisions regarding service level
guarantees and express and implied warranties (to the extent not subject to
legally effective express exclusions thereof) that, to the Companys
knowledge, is in excess of any reserves therefor reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet.

(x) The Company has and enforces a policy to document all material bugs,
errors and defects in all the Company Products, and such documentation is
retained internally at the Company.



 

-28- (y) For all software used by the Company and its Subsidiaries in providing
services, or in developing or making available any of the Company Products,
the Company or a Subsidiary has and enforces a policy to implement any and all
material security patches or material upgrades that are generally available
for that software that have been provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries
by the applicable licensor.

(z) No (i) government funding; (ii) facilities of a university, college,
other educational institution or research center; or (iii) funding from any
Person (other than funds received in consideration for the Company Capital
Stock) was used in the development of the Company-Owned IP Rights or Company
IP Rights purported to be owned by the Company or any Subsidiary. To the
Companys knowledge, no current or former employee, consultant or independent
contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary, who was involved in, or who
contributed to, the creation or development of any Company-Owned IP Rights or
Company IP Rights purported to be owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, has
performed services for any government, university, college or
other educational institution or research center during a period of time
during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also
performing services for the Company or any Subsidiary.

(aa) Neither the Company or any Subsidiary nor any other Person then acting on
their authorization has disclosed, delivered or licensed to any Person,
agreed to disclose, deliver or license to any Person, or permitted the
disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person of, any Company
Source Code (other than to individual consultants or employees having a need
to know such information and who are subject to confidentiality agreements
with the Company or its Subsidiaries). No event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will result in the disclosure, delivery or license by the
Company or any Subsidiary or any Person then acting on their authorization to
any Person of any Company Source Code (other than as described above).
_Schedule 2.10(aa)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each Contract
pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary has deposited, or is or may be
required to deposit, with an escrowholder or any other Person, any of the
Company Source Code.

director, officer, employee, or consultant (provided that, for former
directors, officers, employees and consultants, such agreements need only be
listed if unsatisfied obligations of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
greater than $100,000 remain thereunder), and (vii) any other written or oral
arrangement for the benefit of any employee under which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate has or may have material liability, contingent or otherwise
(all of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through (vii), collectively,
the "Company Employee Plans"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has, since July 30, 2002, extended credit, arranged for the extension of
credit, or renewed, modified or forgiven an extension of credit made prior to
such date, in the form of a personal loan to or for any officer or director
of the Company.

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available to
Parent a true, correct and complete copy of each of the Company Employee
Plans and related plan documents (including trust documents, insurance
policies or Contracts, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and other
material documents) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which
is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided or made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for
the last three plan years. With respect to any Company Employee Plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the Company or the ERISA
Affiliate, as applicable, has either obtained from the Internal Revenue
Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the
Code, or has timely applied (or has time remaining in which to timely apply)
to the Internal Revenue Service for such a determination letter or such
Company Employee Plan has been established under a standardized prototype plan
for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion letter has been obtained by the
plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. Each Company Employee
Plan, and the operation and administration thereof, is in all material
respects in compliance with, and has been operated in all material respects
in compliance with, all Legal Requirements and its terms. The Company has also
provided or made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued
with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and to the Companys
knowledge, nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of
any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. The  



 

-33-  Company has also provided or made available to Parent all registration
statements and prospectuses prepared in connection with each Company Employee
Plan, if applicable.

(c) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA")
or other applicable Legal Requirements. To the Companys knowledge, there are
no "prohibited transactions" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for which an exemption does not apply) with respect
to any Company Employee Plan that the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has
liability with respect thereto. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or
ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material liability or penalty under Section
4976 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company
Employee Plans. All contributions required to be made by the Company, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made
on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for
contributions to each Company Employee Plan for the current plan year (and no
further contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the
Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, after the Company Balance Sheet Date
as a result of the operations of Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Company Balance Sheet Date). Each Company Employee Plan can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without additional material liability to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and/or any Subsidiary.

(d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an
employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or
an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
the Company has timely filed all requisite governmental reports (which, to
the knowledge of the Company, were true, correct and complete as of the date
filed). No Proceeding has been brought, or to the Companys knowledge, is
threatened, against the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate or
with respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry
by the Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor. No
payments or benefits under any Company Employee Plan are, or are expected to
be, subject to the disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or
upon the occurrence of any subsequent event).

(e) Except as necessary to comply with applicable Legal Requirements, there
has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or
not written) by the Company, any Subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate relating
to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan
which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Company
Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Company
Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial
Statements.

(f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate currently
maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, nor has it ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a party to,
or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under,
any "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate has
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
self-insured Company Employee Plan that provides health benefits to employees
(including any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss policy or contract
applies) within the last three years.



 

-34- (h) Neither the Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate (i) currently has, nor has it
ever had, service providers (including employees or consultants) located
outside of the United States, or (ii) currently sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, nor has it ever sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any
Company Employee Plan located outside the United States.

(i) _Schedule 2.13(i)(1)_ to the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Person
who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company, any
Subsidiary and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder), together with any plans or arrangements that could result in the
payment of any "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code) associated with such individual. _Schedule 2.13(i)(2)_ lists each Person
and any Contract, plan or arrangement that provides such Person a "gross-up"
from the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to excise
taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state or local Tax law).

(j) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or any termination of
employment or service in connection therewith or subsequent thereto will (i)
result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any Person, (ii) materially
increase or otherwise enhance any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefits (including Company Options), except as
required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, or (iv) increase the amount of
compensation due to any Person. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any material outstanding loans to any current or former employee,
director or consultant.

(k) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material
respects with all currently applicable Legal Requirements respecting
employment, discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment,
wages (including, to the knowledge of the Company, the proper classification
of employees as exempt and non-exempt or service providers and independent
contractors as consultants under applicable federal and state law), hours and
occupational safety and health and employment practices, employment of non-
citizens (including the Immigration Reform and Control Act), and laws
protecting employees personally identifiable information including credit
identity and medical information. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any obligations other than pursuant to COBRA with respect to any former
employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder. There are no controversies
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, between the Company or any
Subsidiary and any of their respective employees, which controversies will or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Proceeding before any Governmental
Entity.

(l) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to pay any
amount or provide any benefit to any former employee or officer, other than
obligations (i) for which the Company has established a reserve for such
amount on the Company Balance Sheet, and (ii) pursuant to Contracts entered

of any labor union or to organize their respective employees. There is no
labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Company or any Subsidiary
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened which may interfere with
the respective business activities of the Company or any Subsidiary.



 

-35- (m) To the Companys knowledge, no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
is in violation of any term of any employment agreement, noncompetition
agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the
right of any such employee to be employed by the Company or any Subsidiary
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by the Company or any Subsidiary or to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others. The employment of each of the employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary is "at will" and the Company and each
Subsidiary does not have any obligation to provide any particular form or

respective employees (in each case except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements).

(n) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has provided or made available to

-41-  takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement applies or purports to apply
to the Merger or this Agreement. The Company is not a party to, and
the Companys equity securities will not be affected by, any rights
agreement, "poison pill" or similar plan, agreement or arrangement of the
Company, which would materially and adversely effect the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

2.21 _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received an opinion from
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, dated on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Per-Share
Cash Amount to be received by the holders of the Companys Common Stock,
other than Parent, Sub, any affiliates of Parent or Sub, or holders of
Dissenting Shares, pursuant to the Merger is fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of such shares (the "Fairness Opinion"). A copy of the
Fairness Opinion will be delivered to Parent, for informational purposes only,
promptly after the execution of this Agreement.

2.22 _Information Supplied_. The preliminary and definitive proxy statements
to be filed by the Company with the SEC (collectively, the "Proxy Statement")
shall not, on each relevant filing date, on the date of mailing to the
Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has become
false or misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information that was supplied
by Parent or Sub that is contained in the Proxy Statement.

receipt thereof (but in no event more than one Business Day after receipt)
shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, or offer that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any
other communication received by the Company or any Company Representatives
that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) any
request for non-public information which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, as well as, in the event of any of (i)-(iv) above,
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request, and the identity
of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The Company will
keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable (but in no event more
than one Business Day after receipt) of the status and terms (including,
within one Business Day after receipt, of any amendments, modifications or
proposed amendments or modifications) of any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request, and
provide to Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than one
Business Day after receipt) a copy of all written and other materials and
information provided to the Company in connection with any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request.
The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice (or such
lesser prior notice as provided to the members of the Company Board but in no
event less than 24 hours) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal,
including to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer.

(c) _Superior Offers_. In the event that any Person submits to the Company
(and does not withdraw) a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in violation of Section 5.3(a) that the Company Board reasonably
concludes in good faith (after consulting with its outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of national standing) is, or is reasonably likely
to become, a Superior Offer, then notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), the Company
may, so long as the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained,
(i) enter into discussions and negotiations with such Person and its
representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) deliver or make
available to such Person nonpublic information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, _provided_ , in every case, that the Company, its Subsidiaries
and the Company Representatives comply with each of the following: (A)
neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company Representative
shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3 with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal or any of the representatives of such Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, (B) the Company Board first shall have concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is required in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, (C) the Company
first shall have provided Parent with written notice of the identity of such
Person and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and of the Companys intention to take such actions, (D) the Company
first shall have received from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to the
Companys confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not include any provision for any exclusive
right to negotiate with such Person or having the actual or purported effect
of restricting the Company from fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement and shall require such Person to agree to customary non-solicitation
and standstill provisions covering at least 12 months from execution of such
confidentiality agreement, (E) the Company first shall have given Parent at
least 48 hours advance notice of the meeting of the Company Board at which
such action shall be considered (which notice period may run concurrently
with the 48-hour notice period referred to in Section 5.3(b)), (F) the Company
first shall have given Parent advance written notice of its intent to take the
actions specified in clauses (i) and (ii) in  



 

-51-  this Section 5.3(c), specifying what actions it intends to take, and (G)
prior to or contemporaneously with delivering or making available any
such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company shall deliver such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously delivered by the Company to Parent).

"Superior Offer" shall mean, with respect to the Company, a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of Section 5.3(a) (with the
percentages in clause (A) of such definition changed from 15% to 90% and the
words "15% or more" in clause (B) changed to "substantially all" solely for
the purposes of the definition of Acquisition Proposal as used in this
definition of Superior Offer) made by any Person on terms that the Company
Board has in its good faith judgment concluded (following consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
offer, including conditions to consummation of the offer and the likelihood
and anticipated timing of consummation, and the Person making the offer
(which offer cannot include as a condition to consummation the requirement
that the third party have obtained financing), to be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
the Merger.

(d) _Changes of Recommendation_. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company Board from withholding, withdrawing or modifying its recommendation
to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval if:

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

(ii) the Company shall have provided to Parent reasonably prompt notice at
least 24 hours before any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company
Board will consider the possibility of withdrawing its recommendation to the
Companys stockholders in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval, or
modifying such recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, together with
reasonably detailed information regarding the circumstances giving rise to the
consideration of such possibility;

(iii) a Superior Offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn;

Superior Offer, specifying all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer and identifying the person or entity making such Superior
Offer;

(v) the Company shall have provided to Parent, together with or prior to the

other materials and information made available to the Person or Group making
the Superior Offer together with a complete list identifying all such
materials and information;

(vi) Parent shall not have, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company Board concludes
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
national standing) to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders
as such Superior Offer (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall
convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the
receipt thereof, (B) that the Company Board will not withhold, withdraw or
modify its recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of the
Company Stockholder Approval for four Business Days after receipt by Parent of
the Notice of Superior Offer, and (C) any change to the financial or other
material terms of such  



 

-52-  Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior Offer to Parent and a
new four Business Day period under this clause (vi)); and

(vii) the Company Board has concluded in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer
and any offer made by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(vi), the Company Board
is required to withhold, withdraw, or modify such recommendation in order to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, promulgated under the Exchange
Act;  _provided_ , _however __,_ that the Company Board shall not recommend
that Company stockholders tender shares of Company capital stock in connection
with any tender or exchange offer, or withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Company
Stockholder Approval unless permitted to do so pursuant to Section 5.3(d).

5.4 _Access to Information_.

(a) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, (i) the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants,
investment bankers, counsel and other representatives, and Parents financing

available to (A) all of the Companys and each Subsidiarys properties, books,

intangible, including Intellectual Property) and personnel of the Company or
any Subsidiary as Parent may reasonably request, and (ii) the Company shall,

to Taxes, (C) a schedule of any deferred intercompany gain with respect to
transactions to which the Company or any Subsidiary has been a party, and (D)
receipts for any Taxes paid to foreign Tax Authorities, _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any
Legal Requirement applicable to the Company or a Subsidiary requires that
such party restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information
and the Company shall not be required to permit access, or to deliver or make
available to Parent any information that would result in the disclosure of
information protected by the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work
product doctrine ( _provided_ that, with respect to information that does not
pertain or relate to Parent, Sub, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall enter into any
customary joint defense or similar agreements with respect thereto and upon
entering into such agreements, the Company shall be required to disclose such
information that was previously protected by the attorney-client privilege or
attorney work product doctrine).

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, from the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent of, and confer from time
to time as requested by Parent with one or more representatives of Parent to
discuss, any material changes or developments in the operational matters of
the Company and each Subsidiary and the general status of the ongoing
operations of the Company and each Subsidiary.



 

-53- (c) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto to consummate the Merger.

5.5 _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed an amended and restated Confidentiality Agreement dated November 13,

which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) Parent and the Company have agreed to the text of the press release
announcing the signing of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company shall consult with Parent before issuing or making, and
shall provide and shall not issue, any such press release or make any such

hereby without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ that the
Company may, without obtaining the prior consent of Parent, issue such press
release or make such public statements as such party determines in good faith,
following consultation with legal counsel, may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, as applicable, if
Company has used all reasonable efforts to consult and discuss in good faith
with Parent the form and content thereof prior to its release and has acted in
good faith with respect to the incorporation of any reasonable changes
which are suggested by Parent prior to releasing or making such press release
or public statement. The Company shall cause its employees, officers and
directors to comply with this Section 5.5. Parent shall consult in good faith
with the Company on its communications with customers, suppliers and
employees regarding the Merger.

5.6 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly after the execution of this
Agreement apply for or otherwise seek, and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it
for the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the generality or effect
of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, as soon
as practicable, make any initial filings required under the HSR Act, any
other additional filings required by the HSR Act, and any other applicable
federal, state or foreign antitrust or competition laws, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders or decrees (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). The parties
hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made by
or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other Antitrust Law; _provided_ ,
that with respect to any such analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals, each of Parent and the
Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case of
oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Legal Requirement,
treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such
party requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information.

(b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any
comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any
filings made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of any
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any
Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a),
each party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.



 

-54- (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible
after the execution of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall take any
and all of the following actions to the extent necessary to obtain the
approval of any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement of
any applicable laws regarding the transactions contemplated hereby: (i)
entering into negotiations; (ii) providing information required by law or
governmental regulation; and (iii) substantially complying with any "second
request" for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that:
(i) Parent and the Company shall not have any obligation to litigate
or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any
Judgment, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) Parent shall
be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or
submit to orders providing for a Divestiture.

"Divestiture" shall mean (1) the sale, license or other disposition
or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of
any assets or categories of assets of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, (2) the imposition of any limitation or restriction on
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their
business or the business of the Company or its Affiliates or own such assets,
or (3) the holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock or any
limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) so long as such party has until such date
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.6.

5.7 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
5.3 and 5.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto, to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including (a) taking all reasonable
actions necessary to satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article
6, and (b) executing and delivering such other instruments and doing and
performing such other acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably
desirable to effect completely the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing, and deliver to Parent at or
prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under each Contract
listed or described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (and any Contract entered into after the date of this
Agreement that would have been required to be listed or described on such
_Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_ if entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement), using a form reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ ,
that the Company shall use best efforts to obtain prior to the Closing, and
deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing, the consent from the third party
to the Contract described on _Schedule 5.8_ hereto to the Merger, using a
form  



 

-55-  reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate prior to the Closing, and deliver evidence of
such termination to Parent at or prior to the Closing, all of the Contracts
listed or described on _Schedule 5.8_.

5.9 _Notice of Certain Matters_.

(a) Each party will notify the other party in writing promptly after learning
of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger;
(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity relating
to the Merger; (iii) any change, occurrence or event which, individually or
in the aggregate with any other changes, occurrences and events, is reasonably
likely to cause any of the conditions to closing set forth in Article 6 not to
be satisfied; or (iv) any event that occurs after the date of this Agreement,
that had it occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would have
constituted an exception to any representation made by such party set forth in
Article 2 or Article 3 of this Agreement, as applicable. Each party shall
give prompt notice to the other party of any representation or warranty made
by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
herein or affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to the other party.

(b) The Company will notify Parent in writing promptly after learning of: (i)
any change, occurrence or event not in the ordinary course of its or any
Subsidiarys business, (ii) any change, occurrence or event which,
individually or in the aggregate with any other changes, occurrences and
events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, (iii) any claim, or any verbal or written inquiry by any Taxing
Authority, regarding Taxes payable by the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or
against it or any of its Subsidiaries, or known by the Company or any
Subsidiary to be threatened against Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective directors, officers, employees or stockholders in their
capacity as such, or of any verbal or written correspondence from any Person
asserting or implying a claim against the Company or with respect to any of
its assets or properties (including Intellectual Property) that is, or is
reasonably likely to be, material to the Company; or (v) any claim, or any
verbal or written inquiry by any Taxing Authority, regarding Taxes payable by
the Company or any Subsidiary.

5.10 _Employees_.

(a) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and assist Parent in its efforts
to obtain written consents, waivers or other agreements from Company and
Subsidiary employees with respect to the amendment or termination of Company
Employee Plans, or the adoption of new arrangements with such employees, prior
to the Closing.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide each employee
of the Company or any Subsidiary who continues employment with the Parent or
any subsidiary of Parent following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
with full credit only for eligibility and vesting purposes under the
applicable employee benefit plans of Parent (excluding any Parent
equity compensation plan), to the extent permitted by such plans, for pre-
Closing (i) service with the Company and any Subsidiary, and (ii) service
credited under the comparable Company Plans as of the Effective Time for
employment other than with the Company or any Subsidiary, _provided_ that
such credit shall not result in duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any benefits payable to any
Continuing Employees under any of Parents plans shall be offset by any
similar benefits  



 

-56-  payable under comparable Company Employee Plans to the extent such benefits
are attributable to service with the Company and Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time, _provided_ , that such credit shall not result in
duplication of benefits. Each Continuing Employees accrued vacation and sick
leave balances will be carried over from the Company (or any Subsidiary) to
Parent with respect to a maximum of ten (10) days of accrued vacation and
five (5) days of accrued sick leave for each Continuing Employee, and any
balances in excess of the foregoing shall be paid to such employees by the
Company prior to the Effective Time ("Paid-out Accrued Leave"). With respect
to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent and its subsidiaries in
which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to waive any limitation
as to preexisting conditions and exclusion with respect to participation and
coverage requirement applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the employee benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) Following the Closing, Parent shall either: (i) continue to maintain the
employee welfare benefit plans of the Company for the benefit of Continuing
Employees on substantially similar terms in the aggregate as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) arrange for the Continuing
Employees to participate in any similar Parent employee welfare benefit plans
on terms not less favorable, in the aggregate, than those offered to similarly
situated employees of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii).

5.11 _Assumption of Options and Certain Other Matters_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding under the Company Option Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed and converted
into an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, excluding Non-Employee
Director Options. Each Company Option so assumed and converted shall have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the
terms and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plans and the applicable
stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to the corresponding Company Option, except that (i) such
assumed and converted option shall be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed and converted option shall be equal to the
quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent) obtained by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio and (iii) Parents Board of Directors or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority of the Companys Board of Directors or any
committee thereof with respect to the Company Options and Company Option
Plans. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, Parent shall issue to
each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
outstanding Company Option under the Company Option Plans a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption and conversion of such Company Option.

(b) Not later than two weeks prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
as and to the extent necessary, deliver to Parent a revised _Schedule 2.13(j)_
which sets forth each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with
respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), as of the date such revised _Schedule 2.13(j)_ is
delivered to Parent.

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP in order to shorten each currently ongoing purchase and/or
offering period under such  



 

-57-  plan which extends beyond the Effective Time such that a new purchase date
for each such Current Offering shall occur prior to the Effective Time and
shares shall be purchased by Company ESPP participants prior to the Effective
Time. The Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time, or (ii) the date upon which the Company ESPP terminates by
its terms. Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take
no action pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP to commence any new
purchase and/or offering period.

(d) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Company Options assumed by Parent for which a Form S-8 registration statement
is available as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 20
Business Days, after the Closing.

5.12 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent, at or
prior to the Closing, a spreadsheet in a form to be supplied by Parent to the
Company, which spreadsheet shall be dated as of the date that is one Business
Day before the Closing Date and shall set forth, as of such date, (i) the
names of all holders of Company Options and Unvested Company Shares and their
respective addresses and where available, taxpayer identification numbers,
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Options,
and/or the number of Unvested Company Shares held by such Persons, (iii) the
exercise price per share in effect for each Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (iv) the vesting status and schedule with respect to
each Company Option held by each holder thereof (including the vesting
commencement date and repurchase price payable per share with respect to any
Unvested Company Share), and (v) the Tax status of each Company Option under
Section 422 of the Code (such spreadsheet is referred to throughout as the
"Spreadsheet"). A draft of the Spreadsheet shall be provided by the Company
to Parent not later than five Business Days prior to the proposed date of the
Closing.

5.13  _Termination of Benefit Plans_. The Company shall take such actions in
furtherance of freezing or terminating Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. In the event that actions requested by Parent taken with
respect to Company Employee Plans would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later
than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, provided the Company has been
notified of such requested action within a reasonable time prior to such 10
Business Day period.

5.14 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will assume, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, the obligations of
the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and
its former and current directors and officers (the "Indemnified Parties") and
any indemnification provisions under the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in each
case, subject to applicable Legal Requirements. From and after the Effective
Time, such obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties
as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions will not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, prior to the Effective Time, were or are directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is
required by law.



 

-58- (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts
and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the
form delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided_ , _however
__,_ that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing
DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail"
insurance policy; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute
or "tail" policies) in excess of an amount equal to 250% of the most recently
paid annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the "Maximum Premium"). In
the event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy
(or any substitute or "tail" policies) to the amount of coverage that can be
obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The provisions of this
paragraph shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section
5.13(b), which policies provide the Indemnified Parties with coverage for an
aggregate period of six years after the Effective Time (including with respect
to acts or omissions occurring in connection with approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and nothing in
Section 5.1(a) shall prohibit the Company from obtaining such prepaid policies
prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the cost thereof shall not exceed
250% of the per annum premium rate paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the date of this Agreement for such policies. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parent and
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for their duration.

pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(h), or (iii) (A)
pursuant to either Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d) or 7.1(f)(ii) (but with respect to
a breach of representations and warranties, only in the case of an intentional
breach), (B) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company was publicly disclosed, (or, in the case of 7.1(b) or
7.1(f)(i), an Acquisition Proposal shall otherwise exist and was communicated
to the Company), and (C) within 12 months following the termination of this
Agreement, either an Acquisition with respect to the Company is
consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing for an
Acquisition, then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee

termination the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to the amount of fees and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby up to a maximum of $3,500,000 by wire transfer of same day

amounts set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), the Company shall pay to
Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the

Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit

Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule to the Company Disclosure
Letter. Where a reference is made to a law, such reference is to such law as
amended. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

(b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
phrases "provided to," "furnished to," and phrases of similar import when used
herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true,
correct and complete paper copy of the information or material referred to has
been delivered to the party to whom such information or material is to be
provided. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words
of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or
plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and
(iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement.

(c) In this Agreement, "made available" shall mean that such documents or
information referenced (i) shall have been contained in the Companys DataSite
electronic data room to which Parent and its counsel had access no later than
11:59p.m. on the date that is two days prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Inclusion Date") (except with respect to documents required to be "made
 



 

-68-  available" at a later time by the terms of this Agreement or that Parent or
its counsel requested be added to the electronic data room after
the Inclusion Date), and (ii) a reasonable person accessing such electronic
data room would have been able to discover such documents or information based
upon the labeling of the file containing such document or information and the
placement thereof in the electronic data room, except with respect to
documents and information that have been located and/or categorized in the
manner requested by Parent.

8.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

8.7 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, and
the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms,
and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 5.14.

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent
may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent without the prior consent of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

8.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.10 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware

County of Dover in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the

or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute
