AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement"), dated as of May
5, 2015, is by and among Synageva Biopharma Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Pulsar Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Galaxy Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub 2", and, together with Purchaser, the "Merger Subs"). Parent,
each of the Merger Subs and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein
as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties".

 

WITNESSETH:

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Purchaser shall commence an exchange offer (the
"Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") for the
consideration and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, regardless of whether the Acceptance Time
occurs, (a) the Parties shall effect the acquisition of the Company by Parent
through the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the merger (the "First Merger") and (b) immediately following the
First Merger, the merger of the Company, as the surviving company of the First
Merger, with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving the merger
(the "Second Merger" and, together with the First Merger, the "Mergers");

 

WHEREAS, (a) if the Acceptance Time occurs, the First Merger will be governed
by Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL") and will be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation
of the Offer, and (b) if an Offer Termination occurs, the First Merger will be
governed by Section 251(c) of the DGCL and will be effected as soon as
practicable following the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in each
case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the First Merger, each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that (a) if the Acceptance Time occurs, the Offer
and the Mergers, taken together, or (b) if an Offer Termination occurs, the
Mergers, taken together, in each case, will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board of
Directors") (a) unanimously determined that the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions"), including the Offer
and the First Merger in connection therewith are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (b) determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to enter into, and
declared advisable, this Agreement, (c) approved the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Offer, the Mergers
and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein and (d) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (1) accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and (2) adopt this Agreement
at any meeting of the Company's stockholders held for such purpose and any
adjournment or postponement thereof (such recommendation, the "Company
Recommendation");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors or sole member, as applicable, of Parent and
each of the Merger Subs has approved this Agreement and determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer, the Mergers and the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Offer and the First Merger are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and each of the
Merger Subs and its stockholders or members, as applicable;

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are simultaneously
herewith entering into those certain Voting and Support Agreements (the
"Voting and Support Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, such
stockholders agree to vote shares of Company Common Stock owned by them in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement if a vote is required to effect the
First Merger pursuant to the DGCL; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with the Offer and the
Mergers and to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer and the Mergers.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 

Article I.

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement has not been terminated in
accordance with Article VIII and that the Company shall have complied with its
obligations under Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 hereof, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event later than 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on May 27, 2015), Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, commence the Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"). If the Offer
Termination has not occurred, the obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent
to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Annex A (the "Offer Conditions"). In the Offer, each share of Company Common
Stock accepted by Purchaser shall be exchanged for the right to receive: (i)
$115.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration"), and (ii) 0.6581 shares of Parent
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration", and together with the Cash
Consideration, the "Transaction Consideration").

 

(b) Changes to Terms and Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right to waive any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not,
and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to, (i) reduce the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Transaction
Consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iv) waive, amend or modify any of the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)(1), (E)(5) or (E)(6) of Annex A
(provided, that Parent shall (and shall cause Purchaser to) waive both of the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (E)(5) and (E)(6) of Annex A upon the
written request of the Company), (v) add any condition to the Offer other than
those set forth in Annex A or (vi) amend, modify or supplement any Offer

to register) the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of
Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) by such holder) will be paid an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by
the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent.

herein, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

as Parent or Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

shares or other like change (other than in connection with the Transactions)

acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock
that are tendered pursuant to the Offer.

delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other
than Purchaser or Merger Sub 2) shall be converted into such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by the
average of the highest and lowest price per share of Parent Common Stock on
the Nasdaq on the Closing Date and (B) the Stock Consideration (the "Converted
Shares").

 

(iii) Treatment of Purchaser Shares. At the First Effective Time, each
issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Common Stock") shall be automatically converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common

stock of the First Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From
and after the First Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of
Purchaser Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Transaction Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the First Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Transaction Consideration and the
Fractional Share Cash Amount (as defined below) into which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 3.1(a), as well as any dividends or
other distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
in accordance with Section 3.2(e).

 

(b) Conversion of First Surviving Corporation Shares. At the Second
Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the
part of any of the Parties or holders of any securities of the First Surviving
Corporation or of Merger Sub 2, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub 2
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
remain outstanding as a membership interest of the Surviving Company and (ii)
all shares of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
without any consideration being payable therefor.

 

(c) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held by a person
(a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has not tendered into the Offer and/or has
not voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement at any
meeting of the Company's stockholders held for such purpose or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL
concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require
appraisal of their shares (the "Appraisal Provisions") of Company Common Stock
("Dissenting Shares"), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable,
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Transaction Consideration
as described in Section 3.1(a)(i), but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder, after the First Effective Time, withdraws its demand
for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal,
in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholder's shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of
Company Common Stock had been converted as of the First Effective Time into
the right to receive the Transaction Consideration pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(i). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(d) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred (other than in connection
with the Transactions), then the Transaction Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided
that nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to its securities to the
extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(e) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon
the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i), and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the First Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i)
the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder at the First Effective Time and rounded to
the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Share
Cash Amount"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the First Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as exchange agent (such
exchange agent, which, if practicable, shall also be the depositary pursuant
to the Offer, the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Transaction
Consideration in the Offer and the First Merger and shall enter into an
agreement relating to the Exchange Agent's responsibilities under this
Agreement, which shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.

 

(b) Deposit of Transaction Consideration. Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, prior to or concurrently with the
First Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
(together with, to the extent then determinable, the Fractional Share Cash
Amount) payable in the First Merger to holders of Company Common Stock and
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, prior
to or concurrently with the First Effective Time, evidence of Parent Common
Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock, at Parent's election) representing the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration payable
in the First Merger (such cash and certificates, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund").

 

(c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) into the right to
receive the Transaction Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree) (the
"Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Transaction
Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with Section 3.2(e) (collectively, the "Exchanged Amounts").
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall
make, delivery of the Transaction Consideration, including payment of the
Fractional Share Cash Amount, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends
or other distributions on shares of Parent common stock in accordance with
Section 3.2(e) out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement.

 

(d) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Exchanged
Amounts. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares

of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock
records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or
issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Exchanged Amounts. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares
shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Exchanged Amounts that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. In lieu thereof,
each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Exchanged Amounts shall
upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form
(or such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
exchange and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the First
Effective Time, the Exchanged Amounts in respect of each such share of Company
Common Stock, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 

(e) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date after the First Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) until such
holder shall surrender such share in accordance with this Section 3.2. After
the surrender in accordance with this Section 3.2 of a share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i), the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
(in addition to the Transaction Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash
Amount payable to such holder pursuant to this Article III) any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of
such share of Company Common Stock.

 

(f) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article III upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to any rights of
Dissenting Stockholders). From and after the First Effective Time, (i) all
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Transaction
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.2(d)
(together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with Section 3.2(e)), without interest, and (ii) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time. From and after the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the First Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, at any time after the First
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company, Parent
or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding

$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment. No such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this
Article III, and following any losses from any such investment, or to the
extent the cash portion of the Exchange Fund otherwise diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to make cash payments
pursuant to this Article III, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds
to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock at the First Effective Time in the amount of such losses or other
shortfall, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any cash amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 3.1, shall be promptly returned to Parent.

 

(h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the First Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon Parent's demand, and any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Transaction Consideration
and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III without any interest thereon.

 

(i) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub 2
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion
of the Exchange Fund or the Transaction Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the
Transaction Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this
Article III that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares as of the second (2nd) anniversary of the First Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Transaction
Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(j) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser, Merger
Sub 2, the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax
Law. Any amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 

(k) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
3.2(h), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Transaction Consideration and any dividends and distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

Section 3.3 Company Stock Options.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant
to a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (each, a "Company Option") shall, as of the First Effective
Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action on the
part of any holder of such Company Option, become fully vested and be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive
(without interest), in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
First Effective Time, an amount of cash and a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to (i) the

 

 

 

13  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

Transaction Consideration multiplied by (ii) a number of shares of Company
Common Stock equal to (1) $230.00 minus the corresponding per share exercise
price of such Company Option, divided by (2) $230.00, with the cash portion of
such amount rounded down to the nearest cent and with the portion of such
amount payable in shares of Parent Common Stock rounded down to the nearest
one thousandth of a share (the "Option Consideration"); provided that, each
holder of a Company Option who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) in
respect of a Company Option (after aggregating all of the Option Consideration
due with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Option) will be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent
Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest cent. For the avoidance of doubt,
each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that equals or exceeds
$230.00 shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without entitling the
holder thereof to receive any payment under this Section 3.3(a) in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan.

 

(b) Each restricted stock unit awarded in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding as of the
First Effective Time (each, a "Company RSU Award"), other than any Rolled 2015
RSU Award (as defined in and adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(c)
below) shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any
action on the part of any holder of such Company RSU Award, as of the First
Effective Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company RSU Award to receive (without interest), as soon as
reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time, an amount in cash and a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Transaction
Consideration, as determined in accordance with Section 1.1(a) and subject to
Section 1.1(e), in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company RSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time (the "RSU Consideration"); provided that with respect to any Company RSU
Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be settled at the First
Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, the RSU Consideration shall be paid to the applicable Company RSU Award
holder at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan
and the applicable Company RSU Award award agreement that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each 2015 RSU Award (as
defined below) that is outstanding as of the First Effective Time: (i) fifty
percent (50%) of such 2015 RSU Award (such portion of each 2015 RSU Award, the
"Rolled 2015 RSU Award") outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award in respect of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Rolled 2015 RSU Award by (y) the RSU Exchange Ratio (an
"Adjusted RSU Award"), with each Adjusted RSU Award to continue to be subject
to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Rolled 2015
RSU Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time (including accelerated
vesting upon a termination without "cause" or resignation for "good reason"
(each, as defined in Section 6.1(b)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
within two (2) years following the First Effective Time); and (ii) the
remaining 50% of each 2015 RSU Award shall be treated in the same manner and
on the same terms as any other Company RSU Award in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.3(b) above. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"2015 RSU Award" means a Company RSU Award granted to an active employee of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the First Effective Time, as permitted pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.1(b)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the term "RSU
Exchange Ratio" means the sum of (i) the Stock Consideration and (ii) the
quotient of the Cash Consideration, divided by the Parent Trading Price.

 

(d) All applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to the
payment of the Option Consideration and the RSU Consideration, respectively,
as provided in Section 3.2(j), shall first be withheld from the cash portion
of the Option Consideration payment and the RSU Consideration payment,
respectively. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company Board of
Directors and/or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and
shall take all such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the treatment
of the Company Options and Company RSU Awards (collectively, the "Company
Stock Awards") as contemplated by this Section 3.3. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the First

Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more appropriate registration
statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to Parent Common Stock underlying the Adjusted RSU Awards
pursuant to this Section 3.3.

 

(e) (i) Each outstanding offering period in progress as of the date of this
Agreement (each, an "Offering Period") under the Company Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall terminate at the earlier of (x) the scheduled
purchase date for such Offering Period and (y) the date that is seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, or, if an Offer Termination has
occurred, the First Effective Time, and be the final offering period under the
ESPP, (ii) the accumulated contributions of each ESPP participant under the
ESPP will be used to purchase Company Common Stock on the earlier of (x) the
scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (y) the date that is
seven (7) Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, or, if an Offer
Termination has occurred, the First Effective Time (with any participant
payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of shares returned to the
participant), and (iii) the ESPP shall terminate prior to the Acceptance Time,
or, if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First Effective Time.
No participant may elect to participate in the ESPP after the date of this
Agreement and no participant may increase their payroll deductions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company shall pass resolutions as
and when necessary for the treatment of the ESPP and the purchase rights under
the ESPP as contemplated by this Section 3.3(e).

 

Section 3.4 Further Assurances. If at any time before or after the First
Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that
any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably
necessary or desirable to consummate the Mergers or to carry out the purposes
and intent of this Agreement at or after the First Effective Time, then,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser,
Merger Sub 2, the Company, the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
Company and their respective officers and directors or managers shall execute
and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and
do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the
Mergers and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

to, and in the best interests of, such Merger Sub and its stockholders, (ii)
determined that it is in the best interest of such Merger Sub to enter into,

Transactions, no authorization, consent, order, license, permit or approval
of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent or
the Merger Subs of the Transactions.

 

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and the Merger Subs of this
Agreement does not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss or suspension, limitation or impairment of any
right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any assets required
for the conduct of their business or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation, first offer, first refusal, modification
or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, Contract, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or

provision of the Parent Organizational Documents or the Organizational

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
permit or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummations
of the Transactions.

prior to the First Effective Time, Parent will have taken all necessary action
to permit it to issue the number of Parent Common Stock required to be issued
in connection with the Purchaser's obligations pursuant to Article I and
Parent's obligations pursuant to Article III. Such Parent Common Stock, when
issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right of subscription or
purchase in respect thereof. Such Parent Common Stock, when issued, and the
offering thereof, will be registered under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" Laws.

by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (free and

which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.17 Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action,
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Offer and the
Mergers, taken together, or, if an Offer Termination occurs, the Mergers,
taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 5.18 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article V, the Company acknowledges that neither
the Parent nor the Merger Subs nor any person on behalf of Parent or the

concerning its business (including the Lead Product Candidates), properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to provide access to or make available to
any person any document or information that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (i) violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or
(ii) is subject to any attorney-client or work-product privilege (provided
that the Company will use reasonable efforts to allow such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of such
privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into appropriate common
interest or similar agreements). All requests for access or information made

their respective officers, directors and employees and their respective
agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants
(such officers, directors, employees, agents, financial advisors, investment
bankers, attorneys and accountants, collectively, "Representatives"): (i) to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or
negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) that are ongoing with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) not to, directly or indirectly
through intermediaries, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any
information in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or
facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in response to
an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this Section 6.3 and
to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such
referral), or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve,
recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle (whether written, oral, binding or non-
binding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.

any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in
connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal that remains
in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy all
confidential information in the possession of such person or its
Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled
Affiliates is a party; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the Company Board of Directors determines in

solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a
confidential basis to the Company Board of Directors, a Company Takeover
Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that the Company shall
not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including
regarding any such Company Takeover Proposal) in accordance with, and
otherwise complying with, this Section 6.3. Except to the extent otherwise
permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and

Representatives, receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover
Proposal from any person that did not result from a knowing or intentional
breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives and if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, (i)
furnish information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover
Proposal if the Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms that are not less restrictive in any non de minimis
respect to the other party than those contained in the First Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement
need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the making or
amendment of a Company Takeover Proposal) (such confidentiality agreement, an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that the Company shall
concurrently with the delivery to such person make available to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless
such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and (ii)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event

Company commences furnishing non-public information and/or commences
discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section 6.3(c).

likely to lead to or that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including
the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such
Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of
discussions or negotiations relating to such Company Takeover Proposal
(including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals,
indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Company
Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 6.3.

propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify), in any such case in
a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) publicly make any
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than

that the Company Board of Directors may take no position with respect to a
Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer until the

Change), (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover
Proposal, or (E) other than with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer
covered by Section 6.3(e)(i)(C), if a Company Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or disclosed, fail to recommend against such Company
Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in either
case on or prior to the later of (x) the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the
then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, or, if Parent has made a Meeting
Election, prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof), or (y) the third (3rd) Business Day
after the Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
disclosed, but in any event at least one (1) Business Day prior to such
scheduled Expiration Date or the Company Stockholder Meeting, as applicable)
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement) or agreement in
principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section
6.3(b) or (c)) (a "Company Acquisition Agreement").

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Cut-off Time, but not after, the Company Board of Directors may,
in respect of a bona fide, written unsolicited Company Superior Proposal that
did not result from a breach of Section 6.3, (1) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (2) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(f) in order to enter into a definitive agreement for such Company
Superior Proposal, in either case if and only if, prior to taking such action,
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial adviser and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that, prior to
taking either such action, (w) the Company has given Parent at least four (4)
Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making,
any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal or any proposed Company
Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any related financing commitments in the
Company's possession (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the
Company, a written summary of the terms thereof), (x) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, and (y) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and giving due consideration to
the revisions to the terms of this Agreement to which Parent has committed in
writing, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal (assuming the revisions committed to by
Parent were to be given effect) and that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(z) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the
form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (w) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (w) of
this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day notice
period referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal
to the longer of (1) two (2) Business Days and (2) the period remaining under
the notice period under clause (w) of this proviso immediately prior to the
delivery of such additional notice under this clause (z)) during which time
the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.3(f) anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (w)
through (z) above of this proviso; and provided, further, that the Company has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.3.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and the
Termination Fee has been paid in the manner provided in Section 8.3.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board
of Directors may, at any time prior to, but not after, the Cut-off Time, make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, prior to taking such action, the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of
Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided, however, that,
prior to taking such action, (i) the Company has given Parent at least four
(4) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
and specifying in reasonable detail the potential reasons therefor, (ii) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Company Board of Directors to not make
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (iii) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and provided, further, that
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 6.3.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure obligations
under United States federal or state Law with regard to a Company Takeover
Proposal, including (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act if, in either case, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law or obligations under applicable federal securities
Law of the Company; provided, however, that in any event the Company Board of
Directors shall not make or resolve to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change except in accordance with Section 6.3(e), Section 6.3(f) or Section
6.3(g), as applicable or otherwise take, agree or resolve to take any action
prohibited or governed by this Section 6.3 except in accordance with this
Section 6.3.

 

Section 6.4 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting.

 

(a) Without limiting Parent's obligations pursuant to Section 1.2(b), as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Company
shall jointly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 to register under the Securities Act the offer and sale
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger (the "Merger Form S-4"
and, together with the Offer Form S-4, the "Forms S-4"), which shall include a
proxy statement in preliminary form related to the Company Stockholder
Meeting, which shall also serve as the prospectus of Parent in connection with
the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger
(together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Merger
Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) from and after any Offer Termination (other
than if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII), have the
Merger Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after its filing, (ii) ensure that the Merger Form S-4 complies in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and (iii) keep the Merger Form S-4, if it is the Form S-4
declared effective by the SEC, effective for so long as necessary to complete
the First Merger. The Company shall file with the SEC the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in definitive form as soon as practicable after the
Merger Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC. Each of the Parties shall
furnish to the other all information concerning such Party that is required by
applicable Laws to be included in the Merger Form S-4 and the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so as to enable Parent to file the Merger Form S-4 and
the Company to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.4(a).Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine the
information regarding each of them that is necessary to include in the Merger
Form S-4 and the Merger Proxy Statement/​Prospectus in order to satisfy
applicable Laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
correct any information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use
in the Merger Form S-4 and the

 

 

 

45  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Each Party
shall (A) provide the other and their respective counsels with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Merger Form S-4 and the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing)
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any timely comments thereon made by the other Party or
its counsel, (B) promptly notify the other Party of the receipt of, and
promptly provide the other Party copies of, all comments from, and all
correspondence with, the SEC or its staff with respect to the Merger Form S-4
and the Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall promptly notify the other
Party of any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information, (C) provide the other Party and its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
correspondence between it and/or any of its Representatives on the one hand
and the SEC or its staff on the other hand with respect to the Merger Form S-4
and the Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other Party or its
counsel and (D) promptly provide the other Party with final copies of any
correspondence sent by it and/or any of its Representatives to the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Merger Form S-4 and the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and of any amendments or supplements to the Merger Form
S-4 and the Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.4(a), and subject to Section 6.3, the Company may
amend or supplement the Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus in connection with a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change without the prior consent of Parent. The
Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the fairness opinions of the
Company's financial advisors referenced in Section 4.19 and the notice and
other information required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, (i) at any time after June 1, 2015, Parent
and Purchaser may, by providing written notice to the Company require the
Company, within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice, to, and the
Company shall, establish a record date consented to by Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which date shall be
selected so as to permit the Proxy Statement to be mailed, and a meeting of
the Company's stockholders to be held, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the effectiveness of the Merger Form S-4, for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement (together with any adjournments or postponements
thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") and (ii) concurrent with or
following an Offer Termination, Parent and Purchaser may, by providing written
notice to the Company (a "Meeting Election") require the Company, within two
(2) Business Days, to, and the Company shall (x) give notice of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, and (y) as soon as practicable after the Merger Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act, mail to the holders of Company
Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders
Meeting the Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the date the Company is
required to take such action, the "Proxy Date"). The Company shall duly call,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after
the Proxy Date; provided, however, that in no event shall such meeting be held
later than twenty-five (25) Business Days following the date the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Company's stockholders and any
adjournments or postponements of such meetings shall require the prior written
consent of Parent other than to the extent necessary to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing, and review by the Company's
stockholders prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith is required by applicable Law or the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, and
Parent may require the Company to, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting one (1) time (for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days
but not past two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date), unless prior to
such adjournment or postponement the Company shall have received an aggregate
number of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement, which have not
been withdrawn, such that the condition in Section 7.1(a)(ii) would be
satisfied at such meeting if it were to be held without such postponement or
adjournment. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable
Law or the Company's Bylaws. Unless the Company Board of Directors shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, including
to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in

TABLE OF CONTENTS​

 

 

accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board of
Directors shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
proposed or announced any intention to do so. The Company shall, upon the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each
of the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only
matter (other than related procedural matters) that the Company shall propose
to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not set a record
date, mail a proxy statement with respect to, or convene the Company
Stockholder Meeting unless Parent shall have made a Meeting Election.

 

Section 6.5 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Effective as of the First Effective Time and until the two (2) year
anniversary of the First Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries following the First Effective Time (the
"Company Employees") for so long as the applicable Company Employee remains
employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (1) annual target cash compensation (in the form of base salary
and annual target bonus opportunity) which is no less than that provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (2)
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than employee
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, (3) in respect of each of fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016,
an equity-based incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable
than that provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (4) severance benefits under a broad-based severance policy
or plan that are no less favorable than the severance benefits under a broad-
based severance policy or plan provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries),
which for the avoidance of doubt, for employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the United States shall mean the severance plan disclosed in
Section 6.5 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "Parent Severance Plan");
it being understood that the Company Employees may commence participation in
Parent's compensation and benefit plans on different dates following the First
Effective Time with respect to different compensation and benefit plans.

 

(b) Following the First Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained
by Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors prior to the First Effective Time for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual (including, but not limited to, vacation and other
paid time off credit) under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the First Effective
Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the First Effective Time;
provided that such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of
any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with
respect to the same period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any plan,
program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in
which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods or actively-at-work requirements
under such plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee for an amount
equal to any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision expenses incurred by
such Company Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the

 

 

 

47  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such
Post-Closing Plan, if applicable) for purposes of any applicable deductible,
coinsurance and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-
Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the First Effective Time. Such credited expenses shall also count
toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms will occur upon the First Effective Time. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor, assume, fulfill and
discharge the Company's and its Subsidiaries' obligations under the Company
Benefit Plans.

 

(d) If the First Effective Time occurs during calendar year 2015, each
participant in a Company Benefit Plan set forth on Section 4.10(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule that is an annual cash incentive compensation plan
(each, an "Incentive Plan") who was a participant as of immediately prior to
the date hereof (a "Participant") and who remains employed with Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) through December 31, 2015 and
receives at least a "meets expectations" or equivalent performance rating
under the applicable Incentive Plan, shall receive, at the time that bonuses
are normally paid pursuant to the applicable Incentive Plan, an annual cash
incentive payment in respect of the 2015 fiscal year under the Incentive Plan,
equal to the higher of (A) the cash bonus payable at the target level of
performance (at 100% funding) under the applicable Incentive Plan (the "Target
2015 Bonus") and (B) the actual level of performance achieved with respect to
the 2015 fiscal year, as determined by the Compensation Committee in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Incentive Plan; provided that if a
Participant's employment is terminated without Cause on or following the First
Effective Time and on or prior to December 31, 2015, such participant shall
receive a pro-rated portion of his or her Target 2015 Bonus, with such
proration determined as required under the terms of a given Company Benefit
Plan or otherwise in accordance with the Parent Severance Plan.

 

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the anticipated First Effective Time, the
Company Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to
terminate the Company's 401(k) plans (collectively, the "Company 401(k)
Plan"), effective as of the day prior to the First Effective Time. Following
the First Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company
401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and
Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments
to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent's applicable 401(k) plan (the "Parent
401(k) Plan") to permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, in the form of cash, shares of
Parent Common Stock, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof in
an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company
Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, it being
agreed that there shall be no gap in participation by any Company Employee in
a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing
Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or

 

 

 

48

arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

 

(g) The Company shall provide Parent with an updated Company Equity Schedule
within three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Acceptance Time, or if
the Acceptance Time has not occurred, within three (3) Business Days prior to
the anticipated First Effective Time, to reflect any changes occurring between
the date of this Agreement and the applicable date of delivery of such updated
Company Equity Schedule.

 

Section 6.6 Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer and the
Mergers and make effective the Mergers, including (i) the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations, applications and notices required to be
filed under applicable Law to consummate the Offer and the Mergers (including
the Offer Form S-4, the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Offer
Prospectus and, if applicable, the Merger Form S-4 and the Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating
the Offer and the Mergers, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to
obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party,
including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all
information and documentary material required under the HSR Act) required to
be obtained or made by Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer or the Mergers or the
taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution
and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Mergers and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub 2 and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent
to the Offer and the Mergers and shall not take any action after the date of
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent
from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained to consummate the
Offer and the Mergers.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Offer and the Mergers and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental
Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.6. In that
regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with the other
Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any reasonable
information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request with
respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Parties (or
their counsel) copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings made by such
Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such
Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Offer and the Mergers. Each Party to this Agreement
shall promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in writing,
furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any communication from or
to any Governmental Entity regarding the Offer and the Mergers, and afford the
other Parties a reasonably opportunity to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, any
proposed communication with any such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties agree that it is Parent's sole right to devise the
strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in
connection with any filing, notice, petition, statement, registration,
submission of information, application or similar filing with a Governmental
Entity subject to this Section 6.6. If any Party to this Agreement or any
Representative of such Parties receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer
or the Mergers, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable and after reasonable
consultation with the other Parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response
to such request. To the extent permitted by Law, each Party shall furnish the
other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Offer and the
Mergers, and furnish the other Parties with such reasonable

TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

 

 

information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity; provided, however, that Parent
and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 6.6 as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.6, materials provided pursuant to this
Section 6.6 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company and the Offer or the Mergers or other confidential information,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the
waiting period with respect to the Offer and the Mergers under the HSR Act.
The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly
as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR Act. In
the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to the HSR Act (a "Second Request"), the Parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request as
promptly as practicable or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent, and
counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any
such Second Request review process.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not negotiate, effect or agree to any
business combination (whether structured as a merger, business combination,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any
assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any
person that may compete with any of the products sold or in development by the
Company which business combination or acquisition would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 6.7 Takeover Statutes. None of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take any action that would cause the
Transactions or any Voting and Support Agreement, to be subject to
requirements imposed by any takeover statute. If any "moratorium", "control
share acquisition", "fair price", "supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Offer, the Mergers or any other Transactions, or any Voting and Support
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and their respective boards of
directors, or in the case of Merger Sub 2, its manager, shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting and Support Agreements may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Voting and
Support Agreements.

 

Section 6.8 Public Announcements. Unless a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change has occurred, the Parties shall consult with one another prior to
issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions and shall not issue any such public
announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq; provided that
each of the Company and Parent may make any public statements in response to
questions by the press, analysts, investors or analyst or investor calls, so
long as such statements are not inconsistent with previous statements made
jointly by the Company and Parent (or made by one party after having consulted
with the other party). In addition, unless a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change has occurred, the Company shall, to the extent reasonably practicable
consult with Parent regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of
any material developments or matters involving the Company, including earnings
releases and regulatory matters, reasonably in advance of publication and
release. The Company and Parent agree to issue a joint press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) From and after the First Effective Time, each of the First Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the First
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and
former director and officer of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their
respective heirs, executors and administrators, the "Company Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring or
actions or omissions taken prior to the First Effective Time, including (i)
the Transactions, and (ii) actions to enforce this Section 6.9 or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Company Indemnified Party, and
each of the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall, and
Parent shall cause the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company
to, also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; provided that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and
nonappealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Company
Indemnified Party or as provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or
Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or any indemnification agreements
in existence as of the date hereof between such Company Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are set forth on Section 6.9(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Transactions and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
after the First Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified Parties.

 

(c) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, the Surviving Company shall promptly following the First
Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the First Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO
Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the First
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving
Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
First Effective Time, then, for a period of six (6) years after the First
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained in effect
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those
provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof (provided
that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of similar national reputation that have at
least the same coverage and amounts as the DandO Insurance in place on the date
hereof and containing terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
which are no less advantageous to the Company Indemnified Parties than those
of the DandO Insurance in place on the date hereof) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are
alleged to have occurred at or before the First Effective Time; provided,
however, that the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to make annual
premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of
the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the
"Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Company shall cause to be
maintained policies of

insurance which, in the Surviving Company's good faith determination, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

 

(d) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
6.9 shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents
(or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under any applicable
Contracts or Law.

 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 and Section 2.5(c) shall survive the
First Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

 

Section 6.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any
Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
Party's operations (or the operations of the other Party's Subsidiaries) prior
to the First Effective Time and (b) prior to the First Effective Time, each of
the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

Section 6.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect
to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.12 Financing and Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) Parent shall use its, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to use
their, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect and enforce the Commitment Letter and comply
with Parent's obligations thereunder (provided that the Commitment Letter may
be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as set forth below), (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent to the funding
of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter and any definitive
documents executed in connection therewith (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement), (iii) negotiate, execute
and deliver definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any
"flex" provisions) and (iv) in the event of a failure to fund by the Financing
Sources in accordance with the Commitment Letter that prevents, impedes or
delays the Closing, enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements with respect thereto. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of the Financing and developments with
respect thereto and shall provide to the Company copies of all material
definitive documents related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any
event within three (3) Business Days after the Parent obtains knowledge
thereof, if at any time (A) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason or (B) any of the other parties to the Commitment
Letter notifies Parent that such party no longer intends to provide financing
on the terms set forth therein.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Purchaser
or Merger Sub 2 to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of

 

 

 

52

its rights under, the Commitment Letter without the Company's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or
waiver (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that,
together with available cash of Parent (including the cash proceeds of any
consummated financing as referred to in clause (c) below) and the committed
and available amount of any Alternative Financing, would be less than the
amount required to be paid by Parent under this Agreement, (y) imposes new or
additional conditions precedent to funding the Financing or otherwise expands
the conditions precedent to funding the Financing or (z) would reasonably be
expected to (I) make the funding of the Financing less likely to occur, (II)
prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Financing or the
Transactions or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive
documents with respect thereto in any material respect; provided that Parent,
Purchaser and/or Merger Sub 2 may, without the Company's prior written
consent, amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter
to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing or the Transactions (it being understood that any such amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver that provides for the
assignment of a portion of the Financing commitments to any additional
lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities
and the granting to such persons of approval rights as are customarily granted
to additional agents or arrangers, shall be permitted hereunder and shall be
deemed to not prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the
Financing or the Transactions). Upon any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification pursuant to this Section 6.12(b), the term "Commitment Letter"
shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and complete
copy of any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver of
the Commitment Letter. Without limiting Parent's other obligations under this
Section 6.12, if all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain replacement financing
from alternative Financing Sources on terms and conditions relating to
certainty of funding not less favorable in any material respect to Parent than
the terms and conditions relating to certainty of funding set forth in the
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, in an amount sufficient, when added
to the available cash of Parent and any portion of the Financing that is
available, to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and related fees and expenses (any such financing which
satisfies the foregoing clause, the "Replacement Financing"). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions contained in
this Agreement with respect to the Financing and the Commitment Letter shall
also apply with respect to any Replacement Financing and any documents
executed in connection therewith. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company
a true and complete copy of all documents executed in connection with such
Replacement Financing (which may be redacted in a customary manner consistent
with Section 5.14).

 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the cash proceeds of
consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt received by it for all or
any portion of the Financing and to reduce the commitments under the
Commitment Letter; provided that (i) any such cash proceeds shall be deposited
(or invested in short-term high-grade cash equivalents in a manner consistent
with Parent's past practice) and held by Parent in a segregated account in the
United States and shall be used solely to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and related fees and expenses and (ii)
to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption
right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier of the consummation
of the Transactions on the Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or
the End Date. Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments
in respect of other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the
same and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of such
financing are in the aggregate, including in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company than) the
conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter (any such financing
which satisfies the foregoing clause, the "Alternative Financing"). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions contained in
this Agreement with respect to the Financing and the Commitment Letter shall
also apply with respect to any

Alternative Financing and any documents executed in connection therewith.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and complete copy of all
documents executed in connection with such Alternative Financing (which may be
redacted in a customary manner consistent with Section 5.14).

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable to assist Parent in the
arrangement of the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such cooperation shall include, without limitation (in each case,
to the extent reasonably requested): (i) making senior management and advisors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to participate at times to be
mutually agreed in a reasonable number of informational meetings, bank
presentations and due diligence sessions with proposed lenders, and in
sessions with rating agencies and otherwise cooperating with the marketing
efforts of the Parent and its Financing Sources for any portion of the
Financing, (ii) providing reasonable assistance with the preparation of
materials for presentations, customary bank memoranda and similar customary
marketing documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company's independent accountants
to provide reasonable assistance to Parent consistent with their customary
practice (including to consent to the use of their audit reports on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company in any materials relating to
the Financing or in connection with any filings made with the SEC or pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and to provide any "comfort
letters" necessary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any
debt capital markets transaction comprising a part of the Financing, in each
case, on customary terms and consistent with their customary practice), (iv)
using commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral
in connection with the Financing, including executing and delivering, on the
Closing Date, any customary pledge and security documents or other definitive
financing documents or other certificates as may be reasonably requested by
the Parent, (v) to the extent requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, providing to the Financing Sources at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other
information required by applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable "know your customer", anti-money
laundering and sanctions and OFAC rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT
Act and (vi) facilitating the execution and delivery (at the Closing) of
definitive documents related to the Financing on terms contemplated by the
Commitment Letter). The Company hereby consent to the reasonable use of its
logos in connection with the Financing; provided, that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.12(d) or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in the foregoing Section 6.12(d)
will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees, incur any costs or other
liability or reimburse any expenses, in each case, prior to the Acceptance
Time, or, if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First Effective
Time, for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise
indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement prior to the Acceptance Time, or, if an Offer Termination has
occurred, prior to the First Effective Time (other than delivery of customary
authorization and representation letters in connection with the Financing) or
require any director, officer or employee who will not continue in an
equivalent position after the closing of the Transaction to execute and
deliver any definitive agreement, closing certificate or other document to be
delivered at Closing on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Acceptance Time,
or, if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First Effective Time,
(iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company,
would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (v) provide any information the disclosure of which is
prohibited or restricted under applicable Law, (vi) take any action that will
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws,
(vii) take any corporate actions or provide any corporate approvals in respect
of the execution or delivery of any definitive documents, grant of security or
guarantees or to permit the consummation of the Financing, (viii) provide in
connection with the Financing (A) pro forma financial information, (B) any
description of all or any component of the Financing, including any such
description to be included in any liquidity or capital resources disclosure or
any "description of notes", (C) projections, risk factors or other forward-
looking statements relating to any component of such financing, (D) subsidiary
financial statements or any other

information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X or (E) Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Item
402(b) of Regulation S-K; provided, that subclauses (A) and (C) of this clause
(viii) shall not limit the Company's obligations under Section 6.12(d) to
reasonably assist Parent in its preparation of any such information or
materials. In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
(other than customary authorization and representation letters) relating to
the Financing will be required to be effective until the Acceptance Time, or,
if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First Effective Time, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any
action pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Acceptance Time or,
if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First Effective Time;
provided, that the foregoing shall not prevent the Company and its
Subsidiaries from assisting in the diligence for or preparation of any such
certificate, agreement, arrangement document or instrument contemplated by
Section 6.12(d). No action taken by the Company or any of its Representatives
at Parent's request under Section 6.12(d) shall be considered in determining
whether a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company hereunder has
been breached or whether a condition precedent to the Mergers has been
satisfied.

 

(f) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing
Sources or prospective Financing Sources that are or may become parties to the
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel, auditors and
advisors) so long as such information is furnished by Parent subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings in connection with the Financing.

 

(g) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees, but excluding the costs of the Company's preparation of its annual and
quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives contemplated by Section 6.12(d), and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to (a) any information provided in writing by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the Financing or (b) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such persons.

 

(h) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the financing contemplated
by this Section 6.12, or any other financing, is not a condition to the
Closing, and affirms its obligations to consummate the Transactions (subject
to the conditions contained in Article VII) irrespective and independently of
the availability of any such financing.

 

Section 6.13 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the Company's defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the Transactions, including the Offer and the Mergers.
The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation
commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or
its directors, executive officers or similar persons by any stockholder of the
Company relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Mergers, or the other
Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(a) Parent shall file a notification of listing of additional shares (or
such other form as may be required) with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Offer (if the
Acceptance Time occurs) and the First Merger and such other shares of Parent
Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Offer (if the
Acceptance Time occurs) and the First Merger, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Offer (if the Acceptance Time occurs) and the First Merger and such
other shares of

Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Offer
(if the Acceptance Time occurs) and the First Merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Acceptance Time, or, if an Offer Termination has occurred, prior to the First
Effective Time.

 

(b) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq
to enable the delisting of the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the
termination of its registration under the Exchange Act, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the First Effective Time, provided that such
delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the First
Effective Time.

 

Section 6.15 Rule 14d-10 Matters. The Parties acknowledge that certain
payments have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been
granted or are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance
and other employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit
Plans (collectively, the "Arrangements") to certain holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and holders of Company Stock Awards. The Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") (A)
at a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act (1) each Arrangement presented to the Compensation Committee
on or prior to the date hereof, (2) the treatment of the Company Stock Awards,
as applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, and
(3) the applicable terms of Section 6.5 and Section 6.9, and (B) will take all
other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the

of the Compensation Committee is an "independent director" in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.16 Certain Tax Matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referenced in
paragraph (E)(5) and (E)(6) of Annex A (or, if an Offer Termination occurs,
the opinions of counsel referenced in Section 7.2(d) and Section 7.3(d)),
including by executing and delivering customary tax representation letters to
each such counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
counsel. None of the Parties shall (and each Party shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries not to) knowingly take any action (or fail to take any reasonable
action) which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, or, if an Offer
Termination occurs, the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties
intend to report and, provided the above referenced opinions of counsel are
received, except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for
federal income tax purposes, the Offer and the Mergers, taken together, or, if
an Offer Termination occurs, the Mergers, taken together, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 6.17 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the First
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the Parties to the First Merger or the Second Merger, the officers of the
Surviving Company shall be authorized to, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, execute and deliver such deeds, bills of sale, assignment or
assurances and take all such other action as may be necessary in connection
therewith.

 

Section 6.18 Advice of Changes. The Company and Parent shall each promptly
advise the other Party of (i) any notice or other communication from any
counterparty to a Contract with regard to any action, consent, approval or
waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with respect to such Contract
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (and provide a copy
thereof), (ii) any notice or other communication from any other person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions (and provide a copy thereof) or (iii) upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the Transactions that causes such
Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent
or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or
approval will be materially

delayed. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any
notice or other communication from any party to any Company Material Contract
to the effect that such party has terminated or intends to terminate or
otherwise materially adversely modify its relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company as a result of the Transactions.

 

Section 6.19 Lead Product Candidate Matters. In furtherance and not in
limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis
of any developments, discussions or negotiations relating to any of the Lead
Product Candidates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall (a) promptly inform
Parent of any correspondence with or communication or notice received after
the date hereof from any Company Regulatory Agency, (b) prior to submitting or
making any correspondence, communication, filing or response to any Company
Regulatory Agency, give Parent a meaningful opportunity to review, as
reasonably in advance as practicable under the circumstances, and consider in
good faith Parent's comments to, any such correspondence, communication,
filing or response, (c) consult with Parent in advance of, and give Parent's
representatives the opportunity to attend, any in-person or telephonic meeting
or conference with any Company Regulatory Agency, and with respect to other

have advance notice, promptly update Parent regarding such discussions and (d)
take the actions and comply with the obligations set forth on Schedule 6.19 to
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.20 Agreements Concerning Parent and the Merger Subs.

or expired in accordance with its terms (subject to the rights and obligations
of Parent and Purchaser to extend the Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(c)(ii))

Stock pursuant to the Offer; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available (A) to
any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligations under this
Agreement proximately causes (1) any of the Offer Conditions to fail to be
satisfied or (2) the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with

Conditions, other than the conditions set forth in paragraph (A) of Annex A,
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than the Minimum Condition and the

(E)(5) and (E)(6) of Annex A, which certificates and opinions only need to be

12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 2, 2016 at the election of either
of Parent or the Company by written notice to the other; and provided,
further, that the right to extend or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement proximately caused any of the
Offer Conditions, or if the Offer Termination shall have occurred, the
conditions set forth in Article VII, to fail to be satisfied and such action
or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

 

(d) by either the Company or Parent if an order by a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have been issued permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer (if an Offer
Termination has not occurred) or either Merger and such order shall have
become final and nonappealable provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to a Party if
such order (or such order becoming final and nonappealable) was due to the
material breach by such Party of any covenant or other agreement of such Party
set forth in this Agreement;

 

(e) by the Company (provided that (i) the Company is not then in breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
such that any condition set forth in paragraph (E)(2) or (E)(3) of Annex A

Offer Termination has not occurred, any of the representations and warranties
of Parent and the Merger Subs contained in (I) Article V (other than in
Section 5.9(b) (without regard to "materiality," Material Adverse Effect and
similar qualifiers contained in such representation and warranty)) shall have
become inaccurate, which breach or inaccuracy, individually or when aggregated
with other breaches or inaccuracies, would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay Parent from
consummating the Offer prior to the End Date; and (II) Section 5.9(b) shall
not be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date of this
Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the
Closing Date or (y) if the Offer Termination has occurred, Parent shall have
breached any of its representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, which breach if occurring or continuing to occur as of the Closing

and (B) the relevant breaches, failures to perform or inaccuracies referred to
in clause (A) of this Section 8.1(e) is or are either not curable or is not
cured by the earlier of (A) two (2) Business Days prior to the (x) End Date if

representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein and
such breach results in the failure of any of, if the Offer Termination has not
occurred, the Offer Conditions to be satisfied, or, if an Offer Termination
has occurred, the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 to be
satisfied, and (ii) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred), if (A) the
Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (1) if the Offer Termination shall not have
occurred, if it occurred or was continuing to occur at the Acceptance Time,
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in (E)(2) or (E)(3) of
Annex A, or (2) if an Offer Termination has occurred, if it occurred or was
continuing to occur at the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), and (B) the relevant
breaches, failures to perform or inaccuracies referred to in clause (A) of
this Section 8.1(g) is or are not curable or is not cured by the earlier of

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall terminate and become
void and of no effect (except that the Confidentiality Agreements and the
provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, and the agreements
of the Company, Parent and the Merger Subs contained in the last sentence of
Section 1.1(c)(iv), shall survive any termination), and there shall be no
other Liability on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or the
Merger Subs, on the other hand, to the other except (i) as provided in Section
8.3 or (ii) Liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or any Willful
Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination (in
which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity).

 

Section 8.3 Termination Fee.

 

(a) (i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(f), the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer

61  

 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

 

 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(h),
the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an
account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds within two (2)
Business Days after such termination.

 

(iii) If (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event shall have occurred
at any time following the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section
8.1(c) and (B) at any time on or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of
such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummates any transaction included
within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal (a "Company Takeover
Transaction") (whether or not involving the same Company Takeover Proposal as
that which was the subject of the Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event),
then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an
account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds upon the earlier
of entering into such definitive agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Transaction or the consummation of such Company Takeover Transaction;
provided that for the purposes of this Section 8.3(a)(iii) only, all
references in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "fifteen percent
(15%)" shall instead be references to "fifty percent (50%)".

 

(b) For purposes of this Section 8.3, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if (i) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly announced or publicly disclosed, or (ii) a bona fide third party
or group shall have made, or disclosed its or their intention to make, a
Company Takeover Proposal, directly or through an intermediary, to any member
of the Company Board of Directors or to any person that is a party to a Voting
and Support Agreement, or any controlling Affiliate of such party to a Voting
and Support Agreement, and in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), such Company
Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn in good faith at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the event giving rise to such termination.

 

(c) "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $325,000,000.

 

(d) The parties agree that if this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with any provision under which payment of the Termination Fee is
required hereunder, then upon receipt of such payment by Parent, the payment
of such Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 8.3, shall, except in
the case of fraud or a Willful Breach by the Company of this Agreement, be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Merger Subs for any loss suffered
as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the failure of the Transactions to be consummated and upon payment of such
amount, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach by the Company of this
Agreement, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives shall have any further Liability of any kind
for any reason arising out of or in connection with the Transactions.

 

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not
intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such
Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful
Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent
be entitled to more than one payment of the full Termination Fee in connection
with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which such Termination Fee is
payable.

 

(f) Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub 2 acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent,
Purchaser and Merger Sub 2 would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.3(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or either Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 or any portion thereof, then (i) the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel)

incurred in in connection with such suit and (ii) the Company shall pay to
Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus two percent (2%).

Section 9.5. In the event that any action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby
waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

the Financing Sources and their respective current, former or future
directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders, members,

Section 9.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other

defined for purposes of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the
Offer, Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly-
owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a Merger Sub in lieu of either
entity that is a Merger Sub as of the date hereof, in which event all
references herein to such Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to such Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; provided, further, that any such assignment
or designation shall not, and would not reasonably be expected to, impede or
delay the consummation of any Transaction, prevent or impede the Offer and the
Mergers, taken together, or, if an Offer Termination has occurred, the
Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Subject to the
first sentence of this Section 9.8, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
Section 9.8 shall be null and void.

 

Section 9.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is

jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement and (b) shall not, solely by virtue
thereof, be invalid or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, a suitable and equitable provision
shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision.

 

Section 9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto (including the Disclosure Schedules) and the
Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the

Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with Section 9.11 without notice or Liability to

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer, but subject to the terms and

shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment or, subject to
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return
tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date and theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) in the event
that, at the Expiration Date:

 

(A) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the Offer and
the Mergers under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

 

(B) there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn in
accordance with the terms of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, together with the shares of Company Common Stock (if any) then
owned by Parent, Purchaser and Parent's other Subsidiaries, represents at
least a majority of all then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Minimum Condition");

 

(C) the Offer Form S-4 shall not have been declared effective by the SEC
under the Securities Act or a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Offer Form S-4 shall have been issued by the SEC or proceedings for that
purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the SEC;

 

(D) the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the
First Merger shall not have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of issuance (provided that Parent shall not be entitled to
invoke this condition if it has not complied in all material respects with
Section 6.14); or

 

(E) any of the following shall have occurred and continue to exist as of the
Expiration Date:

 

(1) an injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
shall have been entered and shall continue to be in effect, or a Law shall
have been adopted or be effective, in each case that prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Mergers;

 

(2) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
(i) Article IV (other than in Section 4.1 (first sentence only), Section
4.2(a), Section 4.2(b) (first sentence only), Section 4.3(a), Section
4.3(e)(ii), Section 4.8, Section 4.11(b), Section 4.21 and Section 4.22) shall
not be true and correct both at and as of the date of this Agreement and at
and as of the Expiration Date as though made at and as of the Expiration Date,
other than for failures to be so true and correct (without regard to
"materiality," Company Material Adverse Effect and similar qualifiers
contained in such representations and warranties) that have not, individually
or in the aggregate, had a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) Section
4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b) (first sentence only) shall not be true and correct
at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Expiration Date
as though made at and as of the Expiration Date, except for any de minimis
inaccuracies, (iii) Section 4.1 (first sentence only), Section 4.3(a), Section
4.3(e)(ii), Section 4.21 and Section 4.22 shall not be true and correct in all
material respects at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the
Expiration Date as though made at and as of the Expiration Date, (iv) Section
4.11(b) shall not be true and correct in all respects both at and as of the
date of this Agreement and at and as of the Expiration Date as though made at
and as of the Expiration Date, and (v) Section 4.8 shall not be true and
correct both at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the
Expiration Date as though made at and as of the Expiration Date, other than
for failures to be so true and correct (without regard to "materiality,"
Company Material Adverse Effect and similar qualifiers contained in such
representations and warranties) that have not, individually or in the
aggregate, had a Company Material Adverse Effect (provided that for purposes
of this clause (v) only, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall read
excluding, and without giving effect to, clauses (I), (J) and (M) of the
definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" in Section 9.15(b)(v));
provided, however, that representations and warranties that are made as of a
particular date or period need be true and correct (in the manner set forth in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) as applicable) only as of such date or
period;

(3) the Company shall have failed to perform and comply (i) in all material
respects with all covenants required by the Agreement (other than those set

Rosen and Katz, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated
as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that, on the basis of certain facts,
