PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and effective as of February 3,
2004 among Pentair, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Buyer"), WICOR, Inc., a
Wisconsin corporation ("Company"), and Wisconsin Energy Corporation, a
Wisconsin corporation ("Seller").   WHEREAS, Company is engaged, through the
Water Subsidiaries, including WICOR Industries, LLC, a Wisconsin limited
liability company ("Industries"), in the research and development, design,

issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Company (collectively, the
"Shares"); and   WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase the Shares from Seller,
and Seller desires to sell the Shares to Buyer, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, capitalized
terms used but not defined in the context of the Section in which such terms
first appear shall have the respective meanings set forth in Section
12.17.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree
as follows:   1. PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES   1.1. Purchase and Sale.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, all of the
Shares.   1.2. Designated Purchasers. Buyer may, upon prior written notice
to Seller, assign its rights and obligations, in whole or in part, under this
Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (each such Entity,
a "Designated Purchaser") for the purpose of carrying out the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Buyer shall fully
and unconditionally guarantee the performance of all obligations of Buyer and
any such Designated Purchaser under this Agreement and the other documents
and instruments to be executed and delivered by Buyer or any such
Designated Purchaser pursuant hereto.   2. PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT   2.1.
Purchase Price. The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Shares
shall be an amount equal to Eight Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($850,000,000), as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b), if
at all.   1     2.2. Payment. The Purchase Price shall be paid as
follows:   (a) Cash to Seller. At the Closing, Buyer shall  deliver to
Seller an amount equal to Eight Hundred Fifty Million Dollars 
($850,000,000), minus the amount, if any, by which the Net Asset Value  as
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet is less than Six  Hundred
Fifty-Nine Million Nine Hundred Eight Thousand Five Hundred  Thirty-Six
Dollars ($659,908,536) or plus the amount, if any, by which  the Net Asset
Value as reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet  exceeds Six
Hundred Fifty-Nine Million Nine Hundred Eight Thousand Five  Hundred Thirty-
Six Dollars ($659,908,536).   (b) Adjustment Amount. On or before the tenth
(10th)  business day following the final determination of the Final Closing 
Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 2.3, either (i) Seller shall pay to  Buyer
the amount, if any, by which the Net Asset Value as reflected on  the Final
Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Net Asset Value as  reflected on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, together with interest  on the amount being
paid from the Closing Date to the date of the  payment at a rate per annum
equal to the 90-day London Inter-Bank  Offered Rate plus 200 basis points, or
(ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller  the amount, if any, by which the Net Asset
Value as reflected on the  Final Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the Net Asset
Value as reflected on  the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, together with
interest on the  amount being paid from the Closing Date to the date of the
payment at a  rate per annum equal to the 90-day London Inter-Bank Offered
Rate plus  200 basis points.   (c) Method of Payment. All payments under
this  Section 2.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available 
funds to an account that the recipient, at least forty-eight (48) hours 
prior to the time for payment specified hereunder, has designated in 
writing.   2.3. Determination of Net Asset Value.   (a) Balance Sheet. As
used in this Agreement, "Balance  Sheet" shall mean a schedule in the form of
a balance sheet of Company  showing the net book values, as of a specified
time, of the respective  categories of Balance Sheet Assets and Balance Sheet
Liabilities set  forth in the Recent Balance Sheet. All references in this
Agreement to  "Balance Sheet" or "Net Asset Value" of Company shall be deemed
to refer  to Company after giving effect to the Distribution. The Estimated 
Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the  Audited
Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall  be prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in the United
States taking into account the Distribution ("GAAP")  applied on a basis
consistent with that used in the preparation of the  Recent Balance Sheet,
including the application of consistent accounting  policies, principles,
methodologies and practices. Notwithstanding any  other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that,  during the period from
December 31, 2003 to the Closing Date, there are  any changes in reserves of
Company relating to (i) asbestos, product  liability, current Tax or
environmental Liabilities of Company or Water  Subsidiaries or (ii)
Liabilities of the Non-Water Subsidiaries, such  changes shall not be
reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,  the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet, the Audited Closing Balance Sheet  or the Final Closing
Balance Sheet (except and only to the extent  required by Deloitte in its
presentation of the Audited Closing Balance  Sheet) and, in any case, shall
in no event be taken into account for  purposes of determining the amount
of   2     the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, to be made
pursuant to  Section 2.2(a) or Section 2.2(b).   (b) Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet. For purposes of  determining the Purchase Price payable by
Buyer at the Closing, not less  than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall, in  consultation with Buyer, prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver  to Buyer a Balance Sheet as of the close of
business on the business day  immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"Effective Time"), which  shall represent Seller\'s reasonable estimate of
the Final Closing  Balance Sheet and be accompanied by Seller\'s
determination of (i) the  amount of the Net Asset Value as of the Effective
Time as reflected on  such Balance Sheet and (ii) the amount of any
adjustment to the Purchase  Price pursuant to Section 2.2(a). If Buyer shall
reasonably object to  any of the information set forth on such Balance Sheet,
then, during the  remainder of such five (5) business day period prior to the
Closing,  Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon
appropriate  adjustments such that such Balance Sheet and accompanying
schedules  reflect a mutually acceptable estimate of the Final Closing
Balance  Sheet and the Net Asset Value as of the Effective Time to be
reflected  on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, but in the absence of such 
agreement, the most recent month-end Balance Sheet of Company with  respect
to the Water Business shall control (the estimated Balance Sheet  as agreed
to by the Parties pursuant to this Section 2.3(b), or in the  absence of such
agreement, the most recent month-end Balance Sheet of  Company with respect
to the Water Business, is referred to as the  "Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet"). Company and Seller shall provide to  Buyer such information relating
to the preparation of the Estimated  Closing Balance Sheet as Buyer
reasonably requests in connection with  its review of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet.   (c) Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet. Within sixty (60) 
calendar days after the Closing, Buyer and Company shall prepare, or  cause
to be prepared, in consultation with Seller, and deliver to the  Milwaukee
office of Deloitte and Touche LLP ("Deloitte") a Balance Sheet  as of the
Effective Time (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"). The  Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with  GAAP on a basis
consistent with the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.   (d) Audited Closing
Balance Sheet. Upon its receipt of the  Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet,
Deloitte shall conduct an audit of  the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet in
accordance with generally  accepted accounting standards and in accordance
with the standards set  forth in Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(c). In
connection with the  engagement of Deloitte, each Party shall execute
reasonable engagement  letters and supply such other documents and
information as Deloitte  reasonably requires. Deloitte shall be instructed to
use every  reasonable effort to conduct such audit and deliver to Buyer and
Seller  its audit report with respect to the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet  (the "Audited Closing Balance Sheet") within thirty (30) calendar
days  after its receipt of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and, in
any  case, as soon as practicable after such receipt. In connection with 
Deloitte\'s audit, Deloitte may reflect such adjustments to the  Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet  as shall be
required by Deloitte as a condition to providing its clean  opinion in its
audit report. Promptly upon completion of its audit,  Deloitte shall deliver
to Buyer and Seller the Audited Closing Balance  Sheet accompanied by
Deloitte\'s determination of (i) the amount of the  Net Asset Value as of the
Effective Time as reflected on the Audited  Closing Balance Sheet and (ii)
the amount of any adjustment to the  Purchase Price to be paid and by whom
pursuant to Section 2.2(b).   3     (e) Objection to Audited Closing
Balance Sheet. After the  Audited Closing Balance Sheet is delivered to Buyer
and Seller pursuant  to Section 2.3(d), Buyer and Seller shall each have
thirty (30) calendar  days to review and respond to it in accordance with
this Section 2.3(e).  Buyer and Company shall preserve, and shall instruct
Deloitte to  preserve, all documents or records used in or relevant to the 
preparation of the Audited Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of  Net
Asset Value including, without limitation, accountants\' workpapers  used in
the preparation or audit thereof. During the period of any  review or dispute
within the contemplation of this Section 2.3, Buyer  and Company shall afford
Seller and its authorized Representatives  reasonable access to the same, as
well as to employees of Buyer, Company  and Water Subsidiaries and their
respective accountants, including,  without limitation, Deloitte, upon
Seller\'s request. If Buyer or Seller  objects to any item on the Audited
Closing Balance Sheet, then such  objecting Party shall inform the other
Party on or before the last day  of such thirty (30) calendar day period by
delivering written notice to  the other Party (each a "Balance Sheet
Objection") (i) setting forth in  detail a description of the basis of the
Balance Sheet Objection and the  adjustments to the Audited Closing Balance
Sheet that such objecting  Party believes should be made and (ii) setting
forth the amount of the  Net Asset Value as of the Effective Time based on
the Audited Closing  Balance Sheet, adjusted in accordance with such Party\'s
Balance Sheet  Objection. If no Balance Sheet Objection is delivered within
such thirty  (30) calendar day period, then Buyer and Seller shall be deemed
to have  accepted the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, which shall be deemed
final,  binding, conclusive and nonappealable.   (f) Dispute Resolution
Following Objection.   (i) Negotiation. If either Buyer or Seller shall 
deliver a Balance Sheet Objection pursuant to Section 2.3(e),  then Buyer and
Seller shall promptly meet and attempt in good  faith to resolve any dispute
or disagreement relating to the  Audited Closing Balance Sheet (the "Balance
Sheet Dispute"). Any  resolution between Buyer and Seller as to any disputed
amount  shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable.   (ii)
Resolution by CPA Firm. If Buyer and Seller are  unable to resolve the
Balance Sheet Dispute within thirty (30)  calendar days following the
delivery of a Balance Sheet  Objection, then at any time thereafter Buyer or
Seller may elect  to have the Balance Sheet Dispute resolved by a
nationally  recognized firm of independent public accountants as to which 
Buyer and Seller mutually agree (the "CPA Firm"). The CPA Firm  shall not be
rendering, and during the preceding two-year period  shall not have rendered,
audit services to Buyer, Seller or  Company. The CPA Firm shall, acting as
experts and not as  arbitrators, determine on the basis of the standards set
forth  in Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(c), and only with respect to  the
remaining accounting-related differences so submitted to the  CPA Firm (and
not by independent review), whether and to what  extent, if any, any item on
the Audited Closing Balance Sheet or  the Net Asset Value as of the Effective
Time as reflected on the  Audited Closing Balance Sheet requires adjustment.
In connection  with the engagement of the CPA Firm, each Party shall
execute  reasonable engagement letters and supply such other documents  and
information as the CPA Firm reasonably requires. Without  limiting the
Parties\' obligations under this Section 2.3(f),  each Party may submit such
data and information to the CPA Firm  as such Party deems appropriate. The
CPA Firm shall be  instructed to use every reasonable effort to   4    
perform its services within fifteen (15) calendar days after  submission of
the Balance Sheet Dispute to it and, in any case,  as soon as practicable
after such submission. In resolving the  Balance Sheet Dispute, the CPA Firm
shall not assign a value to  any item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed  by any Party, or less than the smallest value for such
item  claimed by any Party, as presented to the CPA Firm pursuant  hereto.
The CPA Firm\'s determination hereunder shall be set  forth in a written
statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and  shall be final, binding,
conclusive and nonappealable.   (iii) Payment of Fees of CPA Firm. Buyer and
Seller  shall each pay 50% of the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in 
connection with the services provided pursuant Section  2.3(f)(ii).   (g)
Final Closing Balance Sheet. As used in this Agreement,  the "Final Closing
Balance Sheet" shall be: (i) the Audited Closing  Balance Sheet if (A) no
Balance Sheet Objection is delivered during the  thirty (30) calendar day
period specified in Section 2.3(e) or (B) Buyer  and Seller so agree in
writing; or (ii) the Audited Closing Balance  Sheet, as adjusted by (A) the
written agreement of Buyer and Seller  and/or (B) the CPA Firm in accordance
with Section 2.3(f)(ii).   3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

plan subject to Title  IV of ERISA and maintained or contributed to by an
ERISA Affiliate of  Company or any Water Subsidiary:   (i) no such plan has

Water  Subsidiary to any Liability or any of Company\'s or any  Water

ERISA;   (ii) no proceeding has been initiated or  threatened by any Person
(including the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation) to terminate any such

ERISA;   (iv) other than the execution of this  Agreement or the
consummation of any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement, no

30-day notice requirement has been  waived or that could not reasonably be
expected to  subject Company or any Water Subsidiary to any  Liability;  
(v) no such plan that is subject to Section  302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code has incurred any  "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in
Section  302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, respectively),  whether
or not waived;   (vi) no such plan is a plan described in  Section 4064 of
ERISA; and   (vii) except as disclosed on Schedule  3.16(c)(vii), the
present value of the accumulated  benefit obligations under such plan, as
determined by  such plan\'s actuary based upon the actuarial assumptions 
used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial  report prepared with
respect to such plan, did not, as  of such plan\'s most recent valuation
date, exceed the  then current value of the assets of such plan allocable 
to such accumulated benefit obligations.   (d) Prohibited Transactions.
Except as set forth on  Schedule 3.16(d), there have been no "prohibited

4975 of the Code)  for which a statutory or administrative exemption does not
exist with  respect to any Employee Plan/Agreement, other than any such
prohibited  transaction that could not subject Company or any Water
Subsidiary to  any Liability. No   16     Person who is a "fiduciary"

Plan/Agreement has any Liability for breach of  fiduciary duty in connection

Plan/Agreement.   (e) No person engaged by Company or any Water  Subsidiary
as an independent contractor, third party contract laborer,  temporary
employee, or "leased employee" (within the meaning of Section  414(n) of the
Code) has ever been improperly excluded from participation  in an Employee
Plan/Agreement, nor has Company or any Water Subsidiary  used the services of
such individuals to an extent that would reasonably  be expected to result in
the disqualification of any Employee  Plan/Agreement or the imposition of
penalties or excise Taxes with  respect to the Employee Plan/Agreements by
the IRS, the United States  Department of Labor or other Governmental
Entity.   (f) Payments and Compliance. Except as set forth on  Schedule

(A) any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement or (B) any fact or
condition relating to  Company\'s business or assets. Such cooperation shall
include making  available to the requesting Party, at such times and under
such  circumstances so as not to unreasonably disrupt business, the
relevant  information, documents, records and employees of the cooperating
Party,  allowing the relevant personnel of the cooperating Party to assist
the  requesting Party in participating in any such matter (including 
providing testimony in Litigation), executing and delivering documents  or
instruments and taking all such action as the requesting Party  reasonably
requests in connection with such matter; provided, however,  that the
requesting Party shall promptly reimburse the cooperating Party  for all out-
of-pocket costs, for a pro-rata portion of the salary  (including fringe
benefits with such pro-rata portion determined based  upon the time spent in
connection with cooperation) and for travel and   26     subsistence
expenses directly relating to such cooperation of any of the  cooperating
Party\'s employees who assist the requesting Party, unless  the requesting
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under  Article 9 or such costs,
salary and expenses are incurred by the  cooperating Party in assisting the
requesting Party to prepare a Tax  Return described in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.2(b).   (c) Adversarial Proceedings Involving Parties. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.1, although the  existence
of a Dispute or other adversarial proceeding between or among  any of the
Parties shall not abrogate or suspend the provisions of this  Section 6.1, as
to such records or other information directly pertinent  to such Dispute or
other adversarial proceeding, the Parties may not  utilize this Section 6.1
but rather, absent agreement, must utilize the  rules of discovery.   6.2.
Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the  allocation of
responsibility as between Buyer and Seller for certain Tax  matters following
the Closing Date:   (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing  Date.
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller  shall file,
or cause Company and Water Subsidiaries to file, on a timely  basis all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by Company and Water  Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date (taking into account any  extensions of time to
file). Buyer shall prepare or cause to be  prepared, in a manner consistent
with the past practice of Company and  Water Subsidiaries, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and  file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for Company and Water  Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that  are required to be filed after the Closing
Date (other than income (or  franchise) Tax Returns with respect to periods
for which a consolidated,  unitary or combined income (or franchise) Tax
Return of Seller or any  Affiliate of Seller (other than Company or a Water
Subsidiary) will  include the operations of Company or any Water Subsidiary).
In the case  of each such Tax Return prepared or filed by Buyer, Buyer shall
submit a  pro forma Tax Return (with copies of any relevant schedules, work
papers  and other documentation) to Seller for approval within a reasonable
time  prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due to be filed (taking 
into account any applicable extensions), which approval shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, and shall incorporate on such Tax Return any 
reasonable comments timely provided in writing by Seller in respect of  such
Tax Return. Seller shall pay or cause Company and Water  Subsidiaries to pay
all Taxes due and payable on the Tax Returns filed  under the first sentence
of this Section 6.2(a) and shall reimburse  Buyer for all Taxes of Company
and Water Subsidiaries due and payable on  the Tax Returns filed under the
second sentence of this Section 6.2(a)  within ten (10) business days after
payment by Buyer, Company or any  Water Subsidiary of such Taxes to the
extent such Taxes are not  reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability (rather
than any reserve for  deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book  and Tax income) shown on the face of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet.   (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After 
the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, in a  manner
consistent with the past practice of Company and Water  Subsidiaries, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law, and file  or cause to be filed any
Tax Returns of Company and Water Subsidiaries  for Tax periods that begin
before the Closing Date and end after the  Closing Date. In the case of each
such Tax   27     Return prepared or filed by Buyer, Buyer shall submit
a pro forma Tax  Return (with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers
and other  documentation) to Seller for approval within a reasonable time
prior to  the date on which such Tax Return is due to be filed (taking into 
account any applicable extensions), which approval shall not be  unreasonably
withheld, and shall incorporate on such Tax Return any  reasonable comments
timely provided in writing by Seller in respect of  such Tax Return. Seller
shall pay to Buyer within ten (10) business days  after the date on which
Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an  amount equal to the portion
of such Taxes that relates to the portion of  such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are  not reflected in the reserve for
Tax Liability (rather than any reserve  for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between  book and Tax income) shown on the face of
the Final Closing Balance  Sheet. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case
of any Taxes that are  imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax
period that  includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of
such  Taxes that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the 
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based  upon
or related to income or receipts or net worth (e.g., franchise  taxes), be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax  period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of  days in the Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the  denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and  (ii) in the case
of any Taxes based upon or related to income or  receipts or net worth (e.g.,
franchise taxes), be deemed equal to the  amount that would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on the  Closing Date, using the "closing of the
books" method of accounting, and  in a manner consistent with the Final
Closing Balance Sheet. Any credits  relating to a Tax period that begins
before and ends after the Closing  Date shall be taken into account as though
the relevant Tax period ended  on the Closing Date.   (c) Consolidated
Returns for Periods Through the  Closing Date. Seller shall include the
income of Company and Water  Subsidiaries (including any deferred income
triggered into income by  Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and Treasury
Regulation Section  1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into income
under Treasury  Regulation Section 1.1502-19) on the consolidated, combined
or unitary  federal (and state) income (or franchise) Tax Returns of Seller
for all  periods through and including the Closing Date and pay any Taxes 
attributable to such income. Company and Water Subsidiaries shall  furnish
Tax information to Seller for inclusion in Seller\'s federal (and  state)
consolidated (or combined) income Tax Return for the period that  includes
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and  practice of Company
and Water Subsidiaries. Seller shall allow Buyer an  opportunity to review
and comment upon such Tax Returns (including any  amended returns) to the
extent that they relate to Company or any Water  Subsidiary. Seller shall
take no position on such Tax Returns that  relate to Company or any Water
Subsidiary that would materially  adversely affect Company or any Water
Subsidiary after the Closing Date,  unless such position would be reasonable
in the case of a Person that  owned Company or any Water Subsidiary both
before and after the Closing  Date. For the purposes of such Tax Returns, the
income of Company and  Water Subsidiaries shall be apportioned to the period
up to and  including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date
by  closing the books of Company and Water Subsidiaries as of the end of
the  Closing Date and in a manner consistent with the Final Closing Balance 
Sheet. Seller shall not settle any audit of a federal or state income  (or
franchise) Tax Return with respect to periods for which a  consolidated,
unitary or combined income (or franchise) Tax Return of  Seller or of any
Affiliate of Seller (other than Company or any Water  Subsidiary) will
include the operations of Company or any Water  Subsidiary in a manner that
would materially adversely affect   28     Company or any Water
Subsidiary after the Closing Date, unless such  settlement would be
reasonable in the case of a Person that owned  Company or any Water
Subsidiary both before and after the Closing Date,  and Seller shall disclose
to Buyer information relating to any such  settled audit to the extent such
settled audit has a material effect on  the Tax Liabilities of Company or any
Water Subsidiary in any Tax  period, or portion thereof, that begins after
the Closing Date.   (d) Refunds or Credits. At the reasonable request of 
Seller, Buyer shall cooperate, or cause Company or Water Subsidiaries to 
cooperate, with Seller in obtaining any refunds or credits (including 
interest thereon) relating to Taxes for which Seller or any of its 
Affiliates (other than Company or a Water Subsidiary) may be liable  under
this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be  required to file
such claims for refund to the extent such claims for  refund would have a
material adverse effect in future periods or to the  extent the claims for
refund relate to a carryback of an item. Buyer,  Company or Water Subsidiary,
as applicable, shall be entitled to all  other refunds and credits of Taxes;
provided, however, that Buyer shall  not allow the amendment of any Tax
Return relating to any Taxes of  Company or any Water Subsidiary for a period
ending on or prior to the  Closing Date or the carryback of an item to a
period ending on or prior  to the Closing Date without Seller\'s consent. For
purposes of this  paragraph, the terms "refund" and "credit" shall include a
reduction in  Taxes and the use of an overpayment of Taxes as an audit or
other Tax  offset. Receipt of a refund shall occur upon the filing of a
return or  an adjustment thereto using such reduction, overpayment or offset,
or  upon the receipt of cash.   (e) Resolution of Disagreements Between
Seller and  Buyer. If either Seller or Buyer disagrees as to the amount of
Taxes for  which it is liable under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall
promptly  consult each other to resolve such dispute following the receipt
of  written notice from either Party to begin such consultation. If any
such  point of disagreement cannot be resolved within twenty (20) business 
days of the date of such written notice, Seller and Buyer shall within  ten
(10) business days after such period jointly select a nationally  recognized
independent public accounting or law firm with no material  relationship to
Seller or Buyer to act as an arbitrator to resolve,  within forty-five (45)
days after its selection, all points of  disagreement concerning Tax matters
with respect to this Agreement and  presented to such accounting or law firm
at the time of its selection.  If Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, cannot agree  on the selection of an accounting or law firm
within such ten-day  period, they shall cause their respective accounting or
law firms to  select such firm within five (5) business days of the end of
such  ten-day period. Any such resolution shall be conclusive and binding
on  Buyer and Seller. The fees of such independent public accounting or law 
firm shall be divided equally between Seller, on the one hand, and  Buyer, on
the other hand. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause  Company and each
Water Subsidiary to) provide to such firm full  cooperation.   (f)
Payments.   (i) The Parties hereto agree to treat all  indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement  as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all income Tax  purposes and to take no position contrary thereto
in any  Tax Return or proceeding before any taxing authority,  except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or any  applicable Order.   29    
(ii) The Parties hereto agree to allocate the  Purchase Price to the Shares
for all income Tax purposes  and to take no position contrary thereto in any
Tax  Return or proceeding before any taxing authority, except  as otherwise
required by applicable Law or any  applicable Order.   (g) Tax Sharing
Agreement. All Tax sharing Contracts  or similar Contracts with respect to or
involving Company or any Water  Subsidiary shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and after the  Closing Date, neither Company nor any Water
Subsidiary shall be bound  thereby or have any Liability thereunder, and such
Contracts shall have  no further effect for any Tax year (whether the current
year, a future  year or a past year).   6.3. Employee Benefit Plan
Matters.   (a) With respect to any employee benefits that are  provided to
an individual who is an employee of Company or any Water  Subsidiary
(including any individual on layoff, disability or leave of  absence, paid or
unpaid) immediately before the Closing ("Company  Employees") under any
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or  agreement maintained after
the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates  ("Buyer Plans"), Buyer shall cause
service accrued by Company Employees  during employment with Company or Water
Subsidiaries prior to the  Closing Date to be recognized for all purposes to
the same extent  recognized by Company or Water Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the  Closing Date, except to the extent necessary to prevent
duplication of  benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
Buyer Plan  which did not benefit Company Employees prior to Closing,
service  accrued by Company Employees for employment with Company or a
Water  Subsidiary prior to Closing need not be recognized for purposes of 
benefit accrual, except as required by applicable Law. With respect to  any
medical, dental or other welfare benefits that are provided at any  time to
Company Employees under Buyer Plans, any applicable pre-existing  condition
exclusions and waiting periods (except to the extent such  limitations or
waiting periods are already in effect with respect to  such employees and
have not been satisfied under the comparable Employee  Plan/Agreement
immediately prior to the Closing Date) shall be waived,  and each Company
Employee shall be provided with credit for any  copayments and deductibles
paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying  any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any  welfare plans that such employees are
eligible to participate in after  the Closing Date.   (b) Buyer shall cause
to be provided and be solely  responsible for any continuation coverage
required under Section 4980B  of the Code, Sections 601-608 of ERISA or
applicable state Law ("COBRA")  with respect to any current or former
employee of Company or any Water  Subsidiary whose "qualifying event" (as
that term is defined in COBRA)  occurs or occurred at or before the Closing
or in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(c) Buyer shall cause Company and Water Subsidiaries  to honor in accordance
with its terms the Company Retention and  Severance Plan referenced in
Section 5.11(b).   6.4. Pump Business Headquarters. After the Closing,
Buyer will establish the headquarters for its water pump business in
Southeastern Wisconsin.   30     6.5. Certain Product Safety
Matters.  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller, Company and Water
Subsidiaries have been actively involved in efforts to prevent and minimize
Liabilities associated with certain consumer product safety matters commonly
referred to as "entrapment injuries" including, without limitation, through
cooperation with The Industry Consortium for the Prevention of Entrapment
Injuries. Buyer agrees that, following the Closing, Buyer, Company and its
Subsidiaries shall continue in good faith to address, prevent and minimize
any Liability associated with, relating to or arising from any such
matters.   6.6. Investigation.  Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller
and Company on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that (i) none of the
other Party nor the other Party\'s directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates, or Representatives makes any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any of the information provided or made available by it to the other Party or
its Representatives (other than the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement) and (ii) each Party will not assert any claim (whether in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise)
against the other Party or the other Party\'s directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates or Representatives, or hold any such Persons liable
for, any inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to information
(other than the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
and rights to indemnification in connection therewith) furnished by the other
Parties or any such Persons concerning such other Parties; provided the
foregoing shall not preclude any Party from seeking any remedy for fraud
or fraudulent misrepresentation.   6.7. Confidentiality. Except as may be
required (i) by Law; (ii) in connection with fulfilling its obligations under
the terms of this Agreement; (iii) in connection with the defense of or other
involvement in any claim or adversarial proceeding relating to Company or the
Water Business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
among the Parties or involving any third party; or (iv) as otherwise
consented to in writing by Buyer, Seller agrees that, for a period of three
(3) years following the Closing Date, (A) Seller will not directly or
indirectly disclose any Confidential Information that is in its possession;
and (B) if Seller receives a request to disclose all or any part of the
Confidential Information in connection with a legal proceeding, Seller will
(1) promptly notify Buyer of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such request so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, and (2) in the event no such protective order or other
remedy is obtained and disclosure of such information is required,
at Buyer\'s cost and expense, exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
portion of the disclosed information that Buyer so designates.   7.

or with respect to such period), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties, individually or in the aggregate, to be
so true and accurate (without giving effect to any limitation as to
"materiality" or "material adverse effect" set forth therein) would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   7.2. Compliance With Agreement.
Company and Seller shall have in all material respects performed and complied
with all of their respective agreements and obligations under this Agreement
that are to be performed or complied with by Company or Seller prior to or on

competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any Order that is in effect and enjoins or otherwise prohibits

Law applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have

respect to such period), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties, individually or in the aggregate, to be so true and accurate
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "material
adverse effect" set forth therein) would not have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.   8.2. Compliance With Agreement. Buyer shall have in all material
respects performed and complied with all of its agreements and obligations
under this Agreement that are to be performed or complied with by Buyer prior
to or on the Closing Date.   8.3. No Orders. No Governmental Entity of

entered any Order that is in effect and enjoins or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no United

instituted any proceeding seeking any such Order.   8.4. HSR Act and Other
Approvals. All applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
Competition Law applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have expired or terminated.   8.5. PSCW Approval. Seller and Company

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article 9,
from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates (including Company), and their respective directors,
officers and employees (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from
and against all losses, damages, costs, other Liabilities and reasonable
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and defense fees and
disbursements of counsel and other professionals) ("Losses") incurred by such
Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from: (a) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
this Agreement (ignoring, for purposes of determining the existence of any
such inaccuracy or breach or the amount of any Losses with respect thereto,
any "materiality," "material adverse effect" or similar qualifier set forth
in such representation or warranty); (b) any breach of any covenant of Seller
or Company (in the case of Company only with respect to those covenants
required to be performed or complied with by Company prior to the Closing)
contained in this Agreement; (c) any Liability of Company or
Water Subsidiaries for (i) Taxes of Company or Water Subsidiaries with
respect to any taxable period or portion thereof that ends on or before the
Closing Date, or which are otherwise allocated to Seller under this
Agreement, to the extent not reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) shown on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet, or (ii) Taxes with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof
that ends on or before the Closing Date, or which are otherwise allocated to
Seller under this Agreement, to the extent not reflected in the reserve for
Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet, of any Person other than Company or Water Subsidiaries
(A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by
Contract or (D) otherwise; (d) all Liabilities of Company to the extent they
relate to or arise from the ownership of the capital stock of or other
ownership interests in Non-Water Subsidiaries and all Taxes or
other Liabilities assessed on or incurred by Company or any Water Subsidiary
as a result of the Distribution; (e) any Liability of Company or Water
Subsidiaries relating to Products manufactured or sold by Company or Water
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date that contain or are alleged to contain
asbestos; or (f) any Liability of Company or Water Subsidiaries arising from
product liabilities, losses, injuries or damages that occur prior to the
Closing arising from, caused by or arising out of the design, manufacture,
assembly, installation or sale of any Product by Company or Water
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the indemnification obligations of
Seller contained in each of clauses (e) and (f), respectively, of this
Section 9.1 shall in each case be Buyer\'s sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to the matters referred to therein, except for actions grounded in
fraud with respect to which such limitations shall not apply. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall   33    be entitled
to recover Losses under any of clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section
9.1 to the extent Seller has an indemnification obligation under
either clause (e) or (f) of this Section 9.1.   9.2. By Buyer. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article 9, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees and other
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), from and
against all Losses incurred by such Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of
or resulting from (a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement (ignoring, for purposes of
determining the existence of any such inaccuracy or breach or the amount of
any Losses with respect thereto, any "materiality," "material adverse effect"
or similar qualifier set forth in such representation or warranty), (b) any
breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or (c) any
Liability of Company or Water Subsidiaries for Taxes of Company or Water
Subsidiaries for which Seller is not required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) and (d) hereof.   9.3. Indemnification Claims. All claims for
indemnification by a Party to be indemnified hereunder (an "Indemnified
Party") from a Party required to provide indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnifying Party") shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this
Section 9.3.   (a) The Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the 
Indemnifying Party in writing of any claim or demand which the  Indemnified
Party has determined has given rise to a right of  indemnification under this
Agreement. Subject to the Indemnifying  Party\'s right to defend third party
claims as hereinafter provided, the  Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
obligations under this Article 9 as  soon as practicable after the receipt of
written notice thereof from the  Indemnified Party.   (b) In the event that
any written claim or demand  for which an Indemnifying Party may be liable to
any Indemnified Party  hereunder is asserted against or sought to be
collected from any  Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified
Party shall  promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days following
such  Indemnified Party\'s receipt of such claim or demand (including a copy
of  any related written third party demand, claim or complaint) (a
"Claim"),  notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of such Claim (the
"Claim  Notice"). The Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations
to  indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim if the 
Indemnified Party fails to timely deliver the Claim Notice and the 
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. If a Claim is made 
against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled  to
participate therein and, to the extent that they shall wish, to  assume the
defense thereof, and, after written notice from the  Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party of such election to so  assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable  to the Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any  other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in  connection with the defense thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall  cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in the  defense against any such Claim. The Indemnified Party shall
have the  right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such
Claim.  Except as provided in Section 6.2(c) with respect to Claims arising
out  of audits of Tax Returns described in Section 6.2(c), neither the 
Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, nor the Indemnified Party, on the  other
hand, shall admit liability to, or settle, compromise or discharge  any such
Claim without the prior consent of the other party, which  consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,  however, that the Indemnified
Party may refuse its consent to a bona  fide offer of settlement that the  
34     Indemnifying Party wishes to accept if such proposed settlement
might  reasonably be expected to affect adversely the ability of the 
Indemnified Party to conduct its business. In such event, the  Indemnified
Party shall assume the defense of such matter at the sole  expense of the
Indemnified Party and the obligation of the Indemnifying  Party to the
Indemnified Party shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the  amount of the bona
fide offer of settlement that the Indemnified Party  refused to accept plus
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party  prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party notified the Indemnified Party  of the offer of settlement
and (ii) the actual out-of-pocket amount the  Indemnified Party is obligated
to pay as a result of the Indemnified  Party\'s continuing to pursue such
matter. In the event the Indemnifying  Party elects not to or fails to defend
such Claim, the Indemnified Party  shall defend against such Claim in good
faith and in a commercially  reasonable manner at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, and  the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in such  defense at its own expense. Without limiting the
generality of the  foregoing, to the extent that, following the Closing,
pursuant to this  Section 9.3(b), any of Buyer, Company or their respective
Subsidiaries  are engaged in the management or defense of any matter relating
to the  Liabilities described in clauses (e) or (f) of Section 9.1 (an
"Asbestos  or Product Liability Claim"), Buyer will, and will cause Company
and  their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, manage and defend 
against any such Asbestos or Product Liability Claim in good faith and  in a
commercially reasonable manner, subject to Seller\'s right to make  inquiries
to and receive information from Buyer regarding the management  and defense
of any such Asbestos or Product Liability Claim. If Seller  objects to
Buyer\'s management and defense of any such Asbestos or  Product Liability
Claim, then Seller may elect to manage and defend  against any such Asbestos
or Product Liability Claim in good faith and  in a commercially reasonable
manner, subject to Buyer\'s right to make  inquiries to and receive
information from Seller regarding the  management and defense of any such
Asbestos or Product Liability Claim.   9.4. Limitations on Indemnification.
Except for fraud or any willful misrepresentation, as to which claims may be
brought without limitation as to time or amount:   (a) Time Limitation. The
representations and  warranties shall survive the Closing for a period
lasting until, and no  claim or action shall be brought under this Article 9
for breach of a  representation or warranty after the lapse of, twelve (12)
months after  the Closing. Regardless of the foregoing, however, or any
other  provision of this Agreement:   (i) There shall be no time limitation
on any  claim or action brought for breach of any representation  or
warranty made in or pursuant to Sections 3.2(c) and  3.3, such
representations and warranties shall survive  the Closing indefinitely, and
Seller hereby waives all  applicable statutory limitation periods with
respect  thereto.   (ii) Any claim or action brought for breach  of any
representation or warranty made in or pursuant to  Section 3.6 may be brought
at any time until the date  that is thirty (30) calendar days after the
underlying  obligation is barred by the applicable period of  limitation
under federal, state or any other applicable  Laws relating thereto (as such
period may be extended by  tolling or waiver) and such representations and 
warranties shall survive the Closing for a period  lasting until such
date.   35     (iii) The representations and warranties in  Section
3.10(c) shall survive the Closing for a period  lasting until, and no claim
or action shall be brought  under this Article 9 for breach of a
representation or  warranty under Section 3.10(c) after the lapse of, five 
years after the Closing.   (iv) The representations and warranties in 
Section 3.16 shall survive the Closing for a period  lasting until, and no
claim or action shall be brought  under this Article 9 for breach of a
representation or  warranty under Section 3.16 after the lapse of, three 
years after the Closing.   (v) Any claim made by a Party hereunder by 
filing a suit or action in a court of competent  jurisdiction or a court
reasonably believed to be of  competent jurisdiction for breach of a
representation or  warranty prior to the termination of the survival period 
for such claim shall be preserved despite the subsequent  termination of such
survival period.   (vi) If any act, omission, disclosure or  failure to
disclose shall form the basis for a claim or  action for breach of more than
one representation or  warranty, and such claims have different periods of 
survival hereunder, then the termination of the survival  period of one claim
or action shall not affect a Party\'s  right to make a claim or action based
on the breach of  representation or warranty still surviving.   (b) Minimum
Claim; Basket; Cap. Except with respect  to claims for breaches of
representations or warranties contained in  Sections 3.2(c) and 3.3 (as to
which the following limitations shall not  apply), a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification  under clauses (a), (e) or (f) of
Section 9.1 only in the event that the  aggregate amount of Losses (without
duplication) suffered or incurred by  all Buyer Indemnified Parties with
respect to all such matters, in the  aggregate, exceeds Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the "Basket") and  then only to the extent of such excess; and
provided, further, that  Seller shall be required to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the  Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to a breach of a
representation  or warranty only if and to the extent the Losses arising
therefrom  exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the "Minimum Claim
Amount") and  such Losses shall be applied against the Basket only to the
extent such  Losses exceed the Minimum Claim Amount; and provided, further,
that the  Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover from
Seller  under clause (a) of Section 9.1 more than Eighty-Five Million
Dollars  ($85,000,000), in the aggregate.   (c) Indemnification as Sole
Remedy. Following the  Closing, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or the  provisions of any Environmental Law including the
Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C.  Sections 9601 et seq., the indemnities provided in this Article 9
shall  be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties hereto, their 
Affiliates, successors and assigns with respect to any and all claims  for
Losses under this Agreement or arising out of Liabilities of Company  or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Real Property under  Environmental Laws,
except for actions grounded in fraud, with respect  to which the limitations
set forth in this Agreement shall not apply.   36     9.5. Adjustments
for Insurance and Taxes and Calculation of Losses.   (a) In the event that
an Indemnified Party has been  indemnified for any Loss pursuant to this
Article 9 and the payment or  accrual of such Loss by such Indemnified Party
results in a deduction  which in turn results in an actual reduction in the
Tax Liability of the  Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof for any Tax
period, then  (without duplication for any such reduction otherwise taken
into  account) the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party the 
amount of such reduction in Tax Liability at the time such Indemnified  Party
actually realizes such reduction in Tax Liability through receipt  of a
refund of Tax or a credit against Tax Liability then due and  payable. For
purposes of this paragraph, a payment or accrual of a Tax  Liability results
in an actual reduction in a party\'s Tax Liability with  respect to a Tax
period, only to the extent that the amount of such  party\'s Tax Liability
with respect to such period, taking into account  such accrual or payment, is
less than the amount of such Liability  determined without regard to such
payment or accrual.   (b) If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party 
are covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution  or
similar obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such 
Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially  reasonable
efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity,  contribution or
similar payments; provided, however, that if any such  insurance policy is
owned by an Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified  Party shall have no
obligation to collect such insurance proceeds but  shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the  Indemnifying Party (including
providing notice to the Indemnifying Party  so that the Indemnify Party may
timely submit a claim under the terms of  such insurance policy) to permit
the Indemnifying Party to cause, at the  Indemnifying Party\'s sole expense,
such insurance proceeds to be  collected. If the Indemnified Party receives
such insurance proceeds or  indemnity, contribution or similar payments prior
to being indemnified,  held harmless and reimbursed under Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2, as  applicable, with respect to such Losses, the payment by an
Indemnifying  Party under this Article 9 with respect to such Losses shall be
reduced  by the net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution  or similar payments to the extent related to such Losses,
less  reasonable attorney\'s fees and other expenses incurred in connection 
with such recovery. If the Indemnified Party receives such insurance 
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being 
indemnified and held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to  such
Losses, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party  the net
amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or  similar
payment to the extent related to such Losses, less reasonable  attorney\'s
fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such  recovery. If any
Indemnified Party receives payment under this Article 9  on account of a
claim that an Indemnifying Party believes in good faith  is covered by an
insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or  similar obligation
of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such  Indemnified Party), that
Indemnified Party shall (i) on written request  of the Indemnifying Party
assign, to the extent assignable, its rights  under such insurance policy or
indemnification, contribution or similar  obligation with respect to such
claim to the Indemnifying Party and (ii)  be relieved of any further
obligation to pursue collection of such  insurance or indemnification,
contribution or similar obligation (except  that, if requested to do so by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified  Party shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party at the  Indemnifying Party\'s sole expense, to
collect any such insurance or  indemnification, contribution or similar
obligation).   37     (c) If during the period from December 31, 2003
to  the Closing Date, there is a change in the amount of any reserve of 
Company and such change in reserve is reflected on the Final Closing  Balance
Sheet and is taken into account for purposes of determining the  amount of an
adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price pursuant to  Section 2.2(a) or
Section 2.2(b) and the Liability to which any such  reserve relates is a
matter for which a Buyer Indemnified Party would  otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1, then the  calculation of a Buyer
Indemnified Party\'s Losses shall be reduced by  the amount of the increase
in such reserve during the period from  December 31, 2003 to the Closing
Date.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this  Agreement, as to
any claims by an Indemnified Party, Losses shall not  include, and no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified or  to make any claim
for, lost profits or any indirect, consequential,  incidental, special or
punitive damages other than any such damages  actually paid by an Indemnified
Party to a Person other than an  Indemnified Party.   10. CLOSING   10.1.

mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;   (b) by either Buyer or

following the giving of written notice by the non-breaching Party to the 
other Party of such breach;   (c) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving

Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no Party

their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the
obligations of the Parties hereto in the Confidentiality Agreement or
contained in this Section 11.2, the penultimate sentence of Section 5.1(b)
and Sections 12.2, 12.5, 12.9 and 12.10 hereof, and except that nothing

have prepared the schedules attached to this Agreement (the "Disclosure
Schedule") and delivered them to Buyer on the date hereof. No representation
or warranty shall be qualified or otherwise affected by any fact or item
disclosed on any Schedule unless such representation or warranty is expressly
qualified by reference to a Schedule, and any fact or item disclosed on any
Schedule shall be deemed disclosed on all other Schedules to which such fact
or item may reasonably apply so long as such disclosure is in sufficient
detail to enable a reasonable person to identify the other article or Section
of this Agreement to which such information is responsive. The Disclosure
Schedule shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter
disclosed pursuant to the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.
No supplement or update to the Disclosure Schedule after the date hereof
shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty for the purposes of Section 7.1 or Section 9.1.   12.2. Publicity.
Each Party agrees that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no
public release or announcement relating to the transactions contemplated

other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as
such release or announcement may, in the judgment of the releasing Party, be
required by Law or Order or the rules or regulations of any United States
securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Parties shall cooperate to prepare
a joint press release to be issued following the execution of this Agreement

Company and Seller shall provide Buyer access to, and facilitate meetings

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and

respect to any Litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  
12.6. Severability. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the provisions of this Agreement are illegal or excessively broad as to
duration, geographical scope or activity, then such provisions shall be
construed so that the remaining provisions of this Agreement  
40    shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect,
and any such illegal or overly broad provisions shall be deemed, without
further action on the part of any Person, to be modified, amended and/or
limited, but only to the extent necessary to render the same valid and
enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction.   12.7. Amendment and
Modification. Buyer and Seller may amend, modify and supplement this
Agreement in such manner as may be agreed upon by them in writing.   12.8.
Waiver. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless expressly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so
waiving. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this

subsequent breach.   12.9. Notice. All notices, requests, demands and
