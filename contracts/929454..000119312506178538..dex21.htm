and paid and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date) by (y) the total
number of days in the fiscal quarter during which the Closing Date occurs,

11 (h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice (subject to
reasonable review by Parent) to each holder of Company Share Options,
Restricted Shares and Company Performance Units describing the treatment of
such equity awards in accordance with this Section 3.01.

Section 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Paying Agent_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Exchange and
Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment or exchange, as
applicable, in accordance with this Article III of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration (collectively, such
cash and shares being referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On or before
the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent the portion
of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable by it pursuant to
Section 3.01(c), the Option Merger Consideration, and (ii) the Company shall
deposit with the Paying Agent the portion of the Company Common Share Merger

Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of Merger.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all
interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the
Surviving Entity.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares or the Company Series
A Preferred Shares. From and after the Effective Time, persons who held
Company Common Shares or Company Series A Preferred Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates of the Company presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Entity or the transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, the Company Preferred Share Redemption
Price, as applicable, with respect to the Company Common Shares or the Company
Series A Preferred Shares formerly represented thereby.

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Entity shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately prior to the
Effective Time held Company Common Shares that were exchanged for the right to
receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.01: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the holders Certificates in exchange for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such



 

12 other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares
previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon such surrender, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 3.02. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares, Company Series A
Preferred Shares, Company Share Options or Share Transfers. As of the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares and Company Series A
Preferred Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders
of the Company other than the right to receive the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration or the Company Preferred Share Redemption Price, as
applicable, provided under this Article III. The Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Company Preferred Share Redemption Price paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Common Shares or
surrender for redemption of Certificates representing Company Series A
Preferred Shares, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares and Company Series A
Preferred Shares exchanged or redeemed theretofore and represented by such
Certificates. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company
Share Options in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining
to the canceled Company Share Options and on and after the Effective Time
the holder of a Company Share Option shall have no further rights with
respect to any Company Share Option, other than the right to receive the
Option Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(e).

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares or
Company Share Options for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Entity and any holders of shares of Company
Common Shares or Company Share Options prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Entity for payment of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration
or the Option Merger Consideration, as applicable.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, REIT Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, the
Company, the Operating Partnership or the Paying Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any person
in respect of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Option Merger
Consideration, as applicable, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.



 

13 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Entity, on a
daily basis. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or the Option Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at
a level sufficient to make such payment.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent
reasonably may direct, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Company Common Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.03 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of shares of Company Common Shares or Company Series A Preferred Shares or
Company Share Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares or Company
Share Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

Section 3.04 _Partnership Distributions_. Prior to the Closing Date,
Operating Partnership shall declare a distribution with respect to each unit
of limited partnership interest (the " _Existing Units_ ") in an amount equal
to the Company Payment, the record date for such distributions to be the
close of business on the second business day prior to the Closing Date, the
payment of which shall be contingent upon closing the Merger. Such
distributions shall be paid on the Closing Date.

Section 3.05 _Termination of DRIP_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate its Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the
" _DRIP_ "), effective prior to the Effective Time, and ensure that no
purchase or other rights under the DRIP enable the holder of such rights to
acquire any interest in the Surviving Entity or any other Parent Party as a
result of such purchase or the exercise of such rights at or after the
Effective Time.

duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (to the
extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to

limited partnership, and none of the Subsidiaries is in violation of any of
the provisions of its certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or

Material Adverse Effect.

information relating to the Company, Parent, REIT Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the
Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or

Company reasonably believes that there are an insufficient number of Company
Common Shares represented in person or by proxy at the Company Stockholders
Meeting to constitute a quorum or to approve this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby, in which case the Company may, and, at
Parents reasonable request, shall, adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries
to, afford Parent, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance
with this Section 7.03, reasonable access during normal business hours to
the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and all
other financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of
its representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with any of the
Companys employees, agents, or representatives (other than the Companys
executive officers, investment bankers or counsel), unless in each case
Parent obtains the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) contact or have any discussions with any of the
landlords/sublandlords, tenants/subtenants, or licensees or franchisees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior



 

41 written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
(iii) damage any property or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing, subject to the rights of any
landlord/sublandlord or tenant/subtenant of any Company Property, so long as
they do not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent and its representatives (including its financing
sources) shall have the right, at Parents expense, to conduct (i) Phase I
environmental assessments of each of the Company Properties and (ii)
with prior written consent of the Company (which such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Phase II environmental assessments. Parent
shall schedule and coordinate all inspections and communications with any of
the landlords/sublandlords or tenants/subtenants of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries and shall give the Company prior written notice thereof
as soon as practicable but in no event less than three (3) Business Days prior
to commencing such assessments (unless otherwise agreed). Parent shall
indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against any and all losses or
damages incurred by the Company as a direct result of the Parents or the
Parent representatives inspection, procedure or investigation of the Company
Properties, _provided_ , _however_ that the Parents indemnification
obligations hereunder shall not include any obligation whatsoever with respect
to any such losses or damages (including claims that any Company Property has
declined in value) arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection
with the discovery of any existing condition at a Company Property not caused
by Parent or Parents representatives in the course of its or their
inspection, procedure or investigation. Parent shall schedule and coordinate
all inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the inspection or
materials that Parent or its representatives intend to conduct. The Company
shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times during any such
inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that
the Company and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consent from the applicable Third Party or enter into a customary joint
defense agreement to enable the disclosure of such information).

(b) All information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.03 and
pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, dated July 28, 2006 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between affiliates of Parent and the Company,

any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

or permit any officer, director, employee, or agent or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, or initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or offers with respect to, or that reasonably may be expected to
lead to the submission of, any



 

42 Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or that reasonably may be expected to lead to, or furnish to any
person any non-public information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall be responsible for any failure on the part of its
Representatives to comply with this Section 7.04; _provided_ , _however __,_
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, REIT Merger Sub and the Company
acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 7.04 by any employee of the Company (other than a director or
officer of the Company) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.04 by
the Company only if and to the extent that the Company shall have
knowingly approved or authorized, or consented or acquiesced to, the action
constituting such violation or failed to use its reasonable best efforts to
prevent such action from occurring or continuing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 7.04, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, furnishing any information to, or entering into or
participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal in writing that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 7.04, if (i) the Company Board determines
in good faith after consulting with its legal counsel and financial advisors
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to furnishing such non-public information
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, the
Company notifies Parent that it is furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such person, and (iii) prior to furnishing
such non-public information to such person, the Company (A) provides Parent
with the information to be provided to such person which Parent has not
previously been provided, and (B) receives from such person an executed
confidentiality and standstill agreement no less favorable to the Company than
the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company will not release any Person from
any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the Company or any
Subsidiary other than the automatic termination of standstill obligations
pursuant to the terms of agreements as in effect as of the date hereof, by
virtue of the execution and announcement of this Agreement or otherwise.

(b) The Company shall provide prompt (but in no event more than twenty-four
(24) hours following receipt thereof) oral and written notice to Parent of (i)
the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification or
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, by the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Company Representative, (ii) a copy of any documents or agreements
provided in contemplation of such Acquisition Proposal (including any
amendments, supplements or modifications thereto), (iii) the identity of such
Person or entity making any such Acquisition Proposal and (iv) the Companys
intention, if any, to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person or entity. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and details
(including any change to the material terms and conditions) of any such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 7.04(c), the Company Board shall not
(i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any



 

43 Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 7.04(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, (x) if the Company Board determines in
good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Law; then the Company Board may, withdraw, or modify or
change in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation ("
_Change in Recommendation_ ") and (y) in the case of any Change in
Recommendation being made in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (which did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
7.04) that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor, is a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal
concurrently with terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(h);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such actions described in clause (y) may only
be taken at a time that is after (I) 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the third
(3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company that the Company Board is prepared to take such action, and (II) at
the end of such period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
taking into account all amendments or revisions committed to by Parent and
after consultation with its independent financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the Merger, as
supplemented by any Counterproposal (defined below) that Parent and REIT
Merger Sub have irrevocably committed to. Any such written notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of such the applicable Acquisition
Proposal, include the most current version of any agreement relating to such
Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments, supplements or modifications
thereto), identify the person making such Acquisition Proposal and state that
the Board otherwise intends to make a Change in Recommendation (subject to
compliance with this subsection (c)). During any such three Business Day
period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company a counterproposal
to such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Counterproposal_ ") and Parent and the
Company shall negotiate in good faith in respect of any such Counterproposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment to any
material term of a Acquisition Proposal which amendment affects the
determination of whether the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal to
any Counterproposal shall be treated as a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 7.04(c) (requiring a new written notice by the
Company and a new three Business Day period).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or from making any
legally required disclosure to stockholders. Further, any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication by the Company or the Company Board to the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to the stockholders of the Company) shall not
be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal, modification or change in
any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion of the Company Board
Recommendation it if is made within ten (10) Business Days of receiving an
Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition



 

44 Proposal by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Representatives and
shall inform each of the Representatives of its obligations under this
Section 7.04 and instruct each of them to act in a manner consistent with such
obligations; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company may comply with the next
sentence. The Company shall promptly request each Person with whom it has
executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve (12) months prior to
the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential or other non-
public information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Company Representatives.

Section 7.05  _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all employment, severance
and termination plans and agreements (including change-in-control provisions)
of employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 7.05 of
the Disclosure Schedule. 

(b) For a period of not less than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date,
for each Company Employee who remains an employee of the Surviving Entity or
its successors or assigns or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to
provide compensation and benefits (including group health, life, disability,
bonus opportunity, and severance plans but excluding equity compensation or
promoted interests or comparable forms of compensation) in the aggregate that
are not less favorable to such employee and the employees dependents and
beneficiaries, as appropriate, as the Company or such Subsidiary provided to
such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, through the maintenance
of any one or more of the Plans, the adoption of new plans, programs,
or arrangements for the benefit of Continuing Employees, or a combination
thereof. To the extent a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement maintained by Parent or
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Parent Plan_ "), such Continuing Employee will
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date
under such Parent Plan to the same extent as such employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under the respective
Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits or any accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plans).
In addition, with respect to each Parent Plan providing medical or health
benefits in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate, during
the calendar year that includes the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee
shall be given credit for amounts paid by the employee under the respective
Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Parent Plan.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the
Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common Shares or
options to acquire Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.



 

45 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to terminate the Companys Director
Deferred Compensation Plan, Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, deferred
restricted share unit arrangements and all other share or investment-based
non-qualified deferred compensation account-based arrangements (collectively,
the " _Non-Qualified Account Plans_ "). Such action shall be contingent upon,
and effective as of, the Effective Time. Payment of the Non-Qualified Account
Plans shall be in cash to the participants in the Non-Qualified Account Plans
in a single lump-sum payment by the Surviving Entity immediately following the
Effective Time or at such later time as may be required by Section 409A of the
Code and its related Treasury regulations.

Section 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, the Operating Partnership Agreement or this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Entity, jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof
through the date of the Effective Time serving as a director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit
plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Partie_ s") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or,
within 10 days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in
any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment
on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with
respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parents or the
Surviving Entitys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Party, if required by applicable Law, to repay such
Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any
settlement effected without Parents or the Surviving Entitys written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by
a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the extent that
any such Indemnified Party shall reasonably determine that such party has a
conflict interest in the outcome of such action from any other Indemnified
Parties. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Entity pursuant to this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby,



 

46 including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or
fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives. As used in this Section 7.06(a): (x) the term " _Claim_
" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or
proceeding, or any such inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any
party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other person, that any
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained
by any of the foregoing or any other person at or prior to the Effective
Time; and (y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all
other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees,
travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any
Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a
Indemnified Party. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened
claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation or
such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the REIT Merger Sub agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries of the Company listed in Section 7.06(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule as provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as
applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability
company agreement, or other organizational documents of any of the
Subsidiaries) and those indemnification agreements of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the operating
agreement of the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and
officers than are set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required
by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law. 



 

47 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail" insurance
policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger), of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the directors and officers of the Company as the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the
benefit of the current and former officers and directors of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary with a claims period of six years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate premium payable
for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period exceed 350% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (such amount being
the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail"
insurance described in the first sentence of this Section 7.06(d) for an
amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an
amount equal to the Maximum Premium. If the Company is unable to purchase
such "tail" insurance, the Parent or REIT Merger Sub shall, at the Companys
request, purchase a "tail" insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions no less favorable to directors and
officers of the Company as the Companys and Companys Subsidiaries existing
policy or policies for the benefit of the current and former officers and
directors of the Company with a claims period of six years from the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Parent or the REIT
Merger Sub be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the aggregate
premium for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period, in which
case the Parent or REIT Merger Sub will obtain as much comparable "tail"
insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

(e) If the Surviving Entity or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.06 and the parties acknowledge
and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the
Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this Section 7.06.

(g) Parent shall have the right to be consulted in respect of the defense
or settlement of any stockholder or limited partner litigation against the
Company, its directors or officers, or the Operating Partnership relating to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to be
kept reasonably informed of material developments; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 

48 Section 7.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings,
and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, if required, and (ii) use its
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger, including using
its reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as are necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions to the Merger.

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 7.07(a), including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject
to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all
related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing,
and, to the extent practicable, neither of the parties will file any such
document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without
prior consultation with the other party. Each party shall keep the other
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable and
permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit
representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and calls with
such Governmental Authority.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action,
including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays,
prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger, including, without
limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal.

(d) Each of the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the Company Parties, on
the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedule. In the event that any Company Party shall fail to
obtain any third party consent described above, the Company Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take such actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company Parties and the Parent Parties and their respective businesses
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Company
Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Authority) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) unless required by the applicable agreement, without the prior
written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, none of
the Company



 

49 or any of the Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) none of the Parent Parties or their respective affiliates shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation.

(e) At Parents request, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent to the extent requested by a secured lender in
obtaining estoppel certificates and subordination and nondisturbance
agreements prior to the Effective Time, in the form provided by Parent, from
those tenants under any lease in excess of 25,000 square feet with respect to
a Company Property.

Section 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together
with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer
Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay
or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration
or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Shares and holders of
Existing Units, all Transfer Taxes.

Section 7.09 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by a party without the prior consent
of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of this
Agreement.

Section 7.10 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters that are within its control;
(ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters; (iii) enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letters; and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to
Closing. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all such
definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.



 

50 (b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and
in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and shall give
the Company prompt notice of any material change with respect to such
Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the
Company promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any time
prior to the Closing Date (i) any Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason, or (ii) any financing source that is a party to
any Commitment Letter notified Parent that such source no longer intends to
provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein. Parent shall not
amend or alter, or agree to amend or later, any Commitment Letter in any
manner that would materially impair, delay or prevent the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the Company, and shall provide the
Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) with any amendments or
alterations to any of the Commitment Letters. 

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters or any Commitment Letter
shall be terminated for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange alternative financing from alternative sources in any
amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions and to obtain, and, if
obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment
that provides for at least the same amount of financing as such Commitment
Letter as original issued and on terms and conditions (including termination
rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent or REIT Merger Sub
than those included in such Commitment Letter.

(d) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and does not require the Company or any of its Representatives to
execute and deliver any certificate or opinion to the extent any
such certificate or opinion certifies or opines, as applicable, with respect
to facts, circumstances or events that will exist after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and the incurrence of any indebtedness of the
Company pursuant to the Financing), including (i) participation in meetings,
drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its
financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent but subject to substantially
the same confidentiality and other restrictions as are applicable to Parent
hereunder, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation
of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to complete the Merger and
(B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt
raised by Parent to complete the Merger, (v) forming new direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, and (vii) using reasonable best efforts to permit Parent
to be able to provide its financing sources with the collateral package
required by such financing sources in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and (viii) cooperating with Parent in connection with obtaining such
consents, approvals or authorizations which may be necessary or beneficial in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the collateral package
required in connection therewith; _provided_ that none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any fees (including commitment or
other similar fees) or



 

51 incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries and it and their Representatives in connection with
such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them prior to
the Effective Time in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and
information provided by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives).

Section 7.11 _Tax Matters_.

(a) For federal and applicable state income tax purposes, each of the parties
hereto shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable sale by the Company
of all of the Companys assets to REIT Merger Sub in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to be received by stockholders of the Company and the assumption
of all of the Companys liabilities, followed by a distribution of such
Merger Consideration to the stockholders of the Company in liquidation
pursuant to Section 331 of the Code and Section 562 of the Code. This
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for federal
income tax purposes.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:

 

(i) Prepare and timely file all material Tax Returns required to be filed by
them on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable
Laws; and

(ii) Timely pay all material Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed.

Section 7.12 _Limited Partner Transaction_. Parent, REIT Merger Sub, the
Company and the Operating Partnership will structure and implement the
transactions described on the binding term sheet attached as _Exhibit D_
hereto (the " _Term Sheet_ ") (including any amendments to the Operating
Partnerships partnership agreement requested by Parent), pursuant to which
each Limited Partner shall, contemporaneously with the Effective Time, receive
cash equal to the Cash Amount in exchange for its Existing Units, or in lieu
of such cash payment shall, at its election made contemporaneously with the
Effective Time, (i) exchange all of its Existing Units for preferred units
with the terms described on _Exhibit D_ or (ii) continue to retain a common
interest in a successor entity on terms and conditions similar to those set
forth in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. Parent, REIT
Merger Sub, the Company and the Operating Partnership, and each of them,
severally agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Term
Sheet, and, unless and until definitive documentation incorporating the terms
set forth in the Term Sheet has been executed and delivered, each of the them
agrees that the Term Sheet constitutes a binding agreement among the parties,
enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms.



 

52 Section 7.13 _Redemption_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall effect the Redemption. Parent and Company will work together in
good faith to fund the Redemption. Without limitation of the foregoing, if the
Redemption is not effective prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Parent Parties agree that each Company Series A Preferred Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into,
and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive the greater of (a) the
Company Preferred Share Redemption Price and (b) the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration on an as-converted basis pursuant to the terms of the
Articles Supplementary classifying the Company Series A Preferred Shares.

damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages payable, or in any other
respect limit or restrict damages available in case of any breach of this
Agreement.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the
Company Expenses when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 9.03.



 

57 Section 9.04 _Escrow of Company Expenses_.

(a) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company Expenses set
forth in Section 9.03(e), Parent shall pay to the Operating Partnership from
the Company Expenses deposited into escrow in accordance with the next
sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Company Expenses and (ii)
the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Operating
Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the
Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the
Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating
that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section
9.04(b) or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in
Section 9.04(b), an amount equal to the Company Expenses less the amount
payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay these
amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Company Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such terms
(subject to Section 9.04(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Operating Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit
into escrow of the Company Expenses pursuant to Section 9.04(b) shall be made
at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Operating Partnership such amount
pursuant to Section 9.03(e) by wire transfer or bank check.

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Company Expenses in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Operating Partnership unless
the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from the Companys independent certified public accountants indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Operating
Partnership without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the
Companys accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent
shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Companys
counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the Company Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has rendered
a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Operating Partnership of
the Company Expenses would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
or would not otherwise disqualify Company as a REIT), in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the Company Expenses to the
Operating Partnership. Parent agrees to amend this Section 9.04 at the
request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Company
Expenses that may be distributed to the Operating Partnership hereunder
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a
favorable ruling described in this Section 9.04(b) or (z) assist the Company
in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described
in this Section 9.04(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any
portion of the Company Expenses held in escrow for five years shall be
released by the escrow agent to Parent. 



 

58 Section 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent, and REIT Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the
other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any
condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
Company or Parent (on behalf of Parent, and REIT Merger Sub). The failure of
any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal

contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may
be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or in accordance
with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by such stockholders.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
by the parties hereto.

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the

relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does
not perform such obligations.



 

60 Section 10.06 _Performance Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due,
prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of
the obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of each of the

Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party
to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of
any other remedy. Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.07(b) for
breaches of the last sentence of Section 7.03(b), the Company agrees that, to
the extent it or the Company Subsidiaries have incurred losses or damages in
connection with this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent
and the Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be limited to $200,000,000,
and the sole and exclusive remedy, (ii) the maximum liability of the
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the respective
obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee and (iii) in no event shall
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries seek to recover any money damages in
excess of such amount in clause (i) from Parent, REIT Merger Sub or the
Guarantor or any of their respective shareholders, partners, members,
managers, directors, officers, agents, and Affiliates in

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the Company or the

performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or an injunction to
prevent any breach of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law
or equity. The parties acknowledge that the Company and the
Operating Partnership shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys and the Operating
Partnerships sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall
be the remedy set forth in Sections 9.03 and 10.07(a); _provided_ , _however_
, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to prevent any breach by Parent of the last sentence of Section
7.03(b).

Section 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the right of the holders of Company
Common Shares and Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Share Options or
Existing Units to receive the consideration defined in Article III and Section
7.06 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby
or the persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such
persons).



 

61 Section 10.09 _Governing Law; Forum_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. The parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Maryland state
or federal court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts.

Section 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have
to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
10.12.
