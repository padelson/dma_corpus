   2.10 | Court Proceedings 
---|--- 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Mitel shall cooperate with and assist
Aastra in seeking the Interim Order and the Final Order, including by
providing to Aastra, on a timely basis, any information reasonably required to
be supplied by Mitel in connection therewith. Aastra shall provide Mitels
legal counsel with reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of
all material to be filed with the Court in connection with the Arrangement,
and will give reasonable consideration to all such comments. Subject to
applicable Law, Aastra shall not file any material with the Court in
connection with the Arrangement or serve any such material, and shall not
agree to modify or amend materials so filed or served, except as contemplated
by this Section 2.10 or with Mitels prior written consent, such consent not

or served materials that expands or increases Mitels obligations set forth in
any such filed or served materials or under this Agreement or the Arrangement.
Aastra shall also provide to Mitels legal counsel on a timely basis, copies
of any notice of appearance or other Court documents served on Aastra in
respect of the application for the Interim Order or the Final Order or any
appeal therefrom and of any notice, whether written or oral, received by
Aastra indicating any intention to oppose the granting of the Interim Order or
the Final Order or to appeal the Interim Order or the Final Order. Aastra

Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. In addition, Aastra shall not object to
legal counsel to Mitel making such submissions on the hearing of the
motion for the Interim Order and the application for the Final Order as such
counsel considers appropriate, provided that Aastra is advised of the nature
of any submissions prior to the hearing and such submissions are consistent in
all material respects with this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. Aastra
shall also oppose any proposal from any party that the Final Order contain any
provision inconsistent with this Agreement, and, if at any time after the
issuance of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date, Aastra is
required by the terms of the Final Order or by Law to return to Court with
respect to the Final Order, it shall do so after notice to, and in
consultation and cooperation with, Mitel.

 



   2.11 | Articles of Arrangement and Effective Date 
---|--- 
 

The Articles of Arrangement shall implement the Arrangement and the
Arrangement shall become effective at the Effective Time on the Effective
Date. Upon issuance of the Final Order and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions precedent in Article 6, each of Mitel and Aastra
shall execute and deliver such closing documents and instruments. On the
second Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
precedent (excluding conditions that are to be and can be satisfied by actions
taken at the Effective Time and the condition in Section 6.2(e), but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) Aastra shall proceed to
file the Articles of Arrangement, the Final Order and such other documents as
may be required to give effect to the Arrangement with the Director pursuant
to section 192 of 

 



\- 21 -   the CBCA (provided that the Articles of Arrangement shall not be sent to the
Director, for endorsement and filing by the Director, except as contemplated
hereby or with Mitels prior written consent), whereupon the transactions
comprising the Arrangement shall occur and shall be deemed to have occurred in
the order set out therein without any further act or formality. From and after
the Effective Time, the Plan of Arrangement will have all of the effects
provided by applicable Laws, including the CBCA. Aastra agrees to amend the
Plan of Arrangement at any time prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
Section 7.4 of this Agreement to include such other terms determined to be
necessary or desirable by Mitel, acting reasonably, provided that the Plan of
Arrangement shall not be amended in any manner which is (a) inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement; (b) would reasonably be expected to
delay, impair or impede the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article 6; (c) which has the effect of reducing the Consideration; or (d)
which is otherwise prejudicial to the Aastra Shareholders or other parties to
be bound by the Plan of Arrangement. The closing of the Arrangement will take
place at the offices of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, Suite 6600, First
Canadian Place, Toronto, Ontario at 8:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the Effective
Date, or at such other time and place as may be agreed to by the Parties.



   2.12 | Payment of Consideration 
---|--- 

Mitel will, following receipt by Aastra of the Final Order and prior to the
filing by Aastra of the Articles of Arrangement with the Director, deposit in
escrow with the Depositary: (i) sufficient funds to satisfy the cash
consideration payable to the Aastra Shareholders, plus sufficient funds to
satisfy any cash payment in lieu of fractional Mitel Shares; and (ii) the
Consideration Shares.



   2.13 | Announcement and Shareholder Communications 
---|--- 

The Parties agree to issue jointly a press release with respect to this
Agreement as soon as practicable after its due execution. Thereafter, Mitel
and Aastra agree to co-operate and participate in presentations to investors
regarding the Arrangement prior to the making of such presentations and to
promptly advise, consult and co-operate with each other in issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public statements with respect to this Agreement
or the Arrangement and in making any filing with any Governmental Entity or
with any stock exchange, including the TSX and NASDAQ, with respect thereto.
Each Party shall: (i) not issue any press release or otherwise make
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without
the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (ii) enable the other Party to review
and comment on all such press releases prior to the release thereof and shall
enable the other Party to review and comment on such filings prior to the
filing thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to each
Partys overriding obligation to make disclosure in accordance with
applicable Laws, and if such disclosure is required and the other Party has
not reviewed or commented on the disclosure, the Party making such disclosure
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written
notice to the other Party, and if such prior notice is not possible, to give
such notice immediately following the making of such disclosure or filing. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prevent either Party from
making internal announcements to employees and having discussions with
shareholders and financial analysts and other stakeholders so long as such
statements and announcements are consistent with the most recent press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Parties.

 



\- 22 -  ---|--- 

The Parties intend that the Arrangement shall be carried out such that the
issuance of the Consideration Shares under the Arrangement qualifies for the
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws in reliance upon similar exemptions under applicable state
securities laws. Each Party agrees to act in good faith, consistent with the
intent of the Parties and the intended treatment of the Arrangement as set
forth in this Section 2.14. In order to ensure the availability of the
exemption afforded by Section 3(a)(10) and corresponding exemptions under
state securities laws; the Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried
out on the following basis:



     | (a) | the Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the
Court; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties
to rely on the exemption afforded by Section 3(a)(10) prior to the Court
hearing at which the Interim Order will be sought; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the
fairness of the Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | the Final Order will address the Arrangement being approved
by the Court as being substantively and procedurally fair to Aastra
Shareholders; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | the Parties will ensure that each Shareholder will be given
adequate notice advising them of their right to attend the Court hearing and
providing them with sufficient information necessary for them to exercise
that right; 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | the Interim Order will specify that each Aastra Shareholder
will have the right to appear before the Court at the Court hearing on the
Final Order so long as such Shareholder files and delivers notice to the
Court of an intention to do so within a reasonable time. 
---|---|--- 

In addition to the foregoing, it is agreed that Mitel shall not be required
to deliver any Consideration Shares to an Aastra Shareholder in any state
where registration or qualification of the Consideration Shares would be
required under state "blue sky" securities laws in order to do so, and may
instead arrange for the sale of any such Consideration Shares on behalf of
such Aastra Shareholder and the delivery to such Aastra Shareholder of an
amount of cash representing the net proceeds of the sale thereof.

Except as set forth in the Aastra Public Documents, Aastra hereby represents
and warrants to Mitel as follows, and acknowledges that Mitel is relying upon
such representations and warranties in connection with the entering into of
this Agreement:

 



     | (a) | _Organization and Qualification_. Aastra is duly
incorporated and validly existing under the CBCA and has the corporate power
and authority to own its assets and conduct its business as now owned and
conducted. Aastra is duly qualified to carry on business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which its assets and properties, owned,

such qualification necessary, and has all Authorizations, consents and
approvals required to own, lease and operate its assets and properties as they
are now being owned, leased and operated and to carry on its business as
now conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified will not,
individually or in the aggregate, have an Aastra Material Adverse Effect. True

to Mitel, and Aastra has not taken any action to amend or supersede such
documents. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Aastra has the

perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the agreements and other documents to be entered into by
it hereunder and the consummation by Aastra of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by the Aastra Board and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Aastra are necessary to authorize
this Agreement and the agreements and other documents to be entered into by
it hereunder other than Aastra Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Aastra and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Aastra, enforceable by Mitel against Aastra in accordance with
its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,

rights generally and subject to the qualification that equitable remedies may
be granted only in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction.

conflict with or result in a breach of: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (A) | any provision of the articles, by-laws or other constating
documents of Aastra or any of its Subsidiaries, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have an
Aastra Material Adverse Effect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | any Material Contract or Authorization to which Aastra or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Aastra or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have an Aastra Material Adverse Effect. 
---|---|--- 

Other than Regulatory Approvals, compliance with any applicable Laws, stock
exchange rules and policies, the Interim Order, the Final Order and the
filing of the Certificate of Arrangement and Articles of Arrangement, no
Authorization of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary on the
part of Aastra or any of its Subsidiaries for the consummation by Aastra of
its obligations in connection with the Arrangement under this Agreement or for
the completion of the Arrangement, except for such Authorizations and filings
as to which the failure to obtain or make would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in an Aastra Material Adverse Effect.



     | (d) | _Subsidiaries_. All of Aastras Subsidiaries or material
interests in any Person have been disclosed in the Aastra Data Room. Each
Subsidiary of Aastra is duly organized and is validly existing under the Laws

and authority to own, lease or operate its assets and property as they are now
being owned, leased and operated and conduct its business as now owned and
conducted by it and is duly qualified to carry on business in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be

securities of each of its material Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding shares
owned (directly or indirectly) by Aastra in the capital of each of its
material Subsidiaries that is a corporation are validly issued, fully-paid and

assets of Aastra and its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with
carrying on the business and operations of Aastra and its Subsidiaries in

Authorization, individually or in the aggregate, would not have an Aastra
Material Adverse Effect. Such Authorizations are in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and Aastra and its Subsidiaries have fully
complied with and are in compliance with all material Authorizations, except,
in each case, for such non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate,

there is no action, investigation or proceeding pending or threatened
regarding any of the material Authorizations. To the knowledge of Aastra,
none of Aastra or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, whether
written or oral, of revocation or non-renewal of any such Authorizations, or
of any intention of any Person to revoke or refuse to renew any of such

Effect and, to the knowledge of Aastra, all such Authorizations continue to
be effective in order for Aastra and its Subsidiaries to continue to conduct
their respective businesses as they are currently being conducted. To the
knowledge of Aastra, no Person other than Aastra or a Subsidiary thereof owns
or has any proprietary, financial or other interest (direct or indirect) in

would cause Mitel or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of the United
States _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_  (and the regulations promulgated
thereunder), the _Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act_ (Canada) (and
the regulations promulgated thereunder) and the _Bribery Act_ (United Kingdom)
or any applicable Law of similar effect.

     | (bb) __ | _Brokers; Expenses_. Except for the fees to be paid to
Jefferies LLC pursuant to its engagement letter with Mitel dated September 12,
2013 (the aggregate amount of fees as disclosed in the Mitel Data Room), none

directors or employees has employed any broker, finder, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person or incurred any liability for any brokerage
fees, commissions, finders fees, financial advisory fees or other similar
fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and to general equity principles and
subject to the inclusion of an exclusive jurisdiction of New York courts
clause contained therein). No event has occurred which would constitute a
breach or default (or with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default) by Mitel under the Mitel Commitment Letter, or, to the knowledge of
Mitel, the other parties thereto. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
to the Arrangement as set out in this Agreement,

respect to such Party or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person without having
(i) entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms no less
favourable to such Party than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that
such agreement does not prevent such Person from making an Acquisition
Proposal to the Aastra Board or Mitel Board, as applicable, and provided a
copy of such confidentiality and standstill agreement to the other Party
and (ii) provided further that the other Party is provided with a list of the
information provided to such Person and the other Party is immediately

     | (ii) | the Aastra Shareholder Approval has not been obtained;

Subsections 5.10(a) through 5.10(d) inclusive;

writing that there is a Superior Proposal together with all documentation

proposed acceptance, approval or execution of the Proposed Agreement by such
Party;

has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement in accordance with
Subsection 5.10(f), the Aastra Board or the Mitel Board, as applicable, shall
have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the
Arrangement by the other Party; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vii) | Mitel terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(a)(iii)(C) or Aastra terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(a)(iv)(C) and, in either case, such Party has previously paid, or
concurrently pays, to the other Party the Aastra Termination Fee or the Mitel
Termination Fee, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, during the Response
Period or such longer period as such Party may approve for such purpose, the
other Party shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to
amend the terms of this Agreement, including an increase in, or modification
of, the Consideration. The Aastra Board or the Mitel Board, as applicable,
will review any proposal by the other Party to amend the terms of the
Agreement in order to determine in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary
duties whether the other Partys proposal to amend the Agreement would result
in the Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Aastra
Board or the Mitel Board, as applicable, determines that the Acquisition
Proposal is not a Superior Proposal as compared to the proposed amendments to
the terms of the Agreement, it will promptly enter into an amended agreement
with the other Party reflecting such proposed amendments. Each successive
modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition

     | (h) | Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set
out in this Section 7.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine
pre-estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each of Aastra
and Mitel irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that
any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty,
each Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where Aastra or Mitel is entitled to a Fee and such Fee is paid
in full, Aastra or Mitel, as the case may be, shall be precluded from any
other remedy against the other Party at Law or in equity or otherwise
(including, without limitation, an order for specific performance), and shall
not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other Party or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in
the event of fraud or wilful breach of this Agreement by a Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

Aastras enforcement of any Fee against Mitel (if the closing of the
Arrangement does not occur) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Aastra and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives against the Financing Sources and their respective affiliates
for any and all losses, claims, expenses, liabilities or damages suffered or
incurred by the Aastra or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
the Mitel Financing, the Mitel Commitment Letter (and the termination
thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis of such
termination and none of the Financing Sources shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Mitel
Financing, the Mitel Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination upon payment of such amount. In addition,
without modifying or qualifying in any way the preceding sentence or implying
any intent contrary thereto, Aastra, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, shareholders or
affiliates or their respective representatives each hereby waive any rights
or claims against the Financing Sources and hereby agree that in no event
shall the Financing Sources have any liability or obligation to Aastra, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers,

\- 85 -  representatives and in no event shall Aastra, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, shareholders
or affiliates or their respective representatives seek or obtain any other
damages of any kind against any Financing Source (including consequently,
special, indirect or punitive damages), in each case, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Mitel Financing, the Mitel Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation
and effect, by the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the Laws of Canada
applicable therein. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement and waives any defences to the maintenance of an action in the
Courts of the Province of Ontario.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto and their
respective Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives agree that any claim, controversy or dispute of
any kind or nature (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) involving
a Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement, the
Arrangement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Mitel Financing or the Mitel Commitment Letter shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Mitel Financing, the Mitel Commitment
Letter, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including,
without limitation, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Mitel Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the
appellate courts thereof), and that the provisions of Section 8.9 relating to
the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

 



   8.3 | Injunctive Relief 
---|--- 

Subject to Section 7.3, the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the
Parties agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by a Party, the non-breaching Party will be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance, and the Parties shall
not object to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the
basis that there exists an adequate remedy at law. Subject to Section
7.3, such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this
Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at Law or
equity to each of the Parties.

 



   8.4 | Time of Essence

Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.



   8.5 | Entire Agreement, Binding Effect and Assignment

the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of the other Party.

 

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no provision of this Agreement
is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that the Financing
Sources shall be intended third parties beneficiaries of Sections 7.3(i), 8.2,
8.6 and 8.9 and shall be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no
amendment or modification to such provisions in respect to the Financing
Sources may be made without the prior consent of the Financing Sources).

and representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Mitel Commitment Letter, the
Mitel Financing, the definitive financing agreements or in respect of any
other document or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith and Aastra (on behalf
of itself and any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents

dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source
shall have any liability for any claims or damages to Aastra in connection
with this Agreement, the Mitel Commitment Letter, the Mitel Financing, the
definitive financing agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.



   8.7 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party.

 



\- 89 -   Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to

closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



   8.8 | Counterparts, Execution

shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties shall be entitled to rely upon
delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be
legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between the Parties.

 



   8.9 | Waiver of Jury Trial 
---|--- 

Each party hereto (on behalf of itself and any of its affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Laws, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited
to any dispute arising out of or relating to the Mitel Financing, the Mitel
Commitment Letter, any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the
performance thereof, including in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim
against any Financing Source. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 8.9.
