required to be disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's

information regarding Acquiror or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and such financial and operating data and other information reasonably requested by the Company (provided, such disclosure would
not result in the waiver by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries of any claim of attorney-client privilege). No investigation by the Company or any of its Representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties made by Acquiror in this Agreement. This </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section&nbsp;6.1(a)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> shall not require the disclosure of any information to the

privilege relating to, the matters being discussed. If any of the restrictions in the preceding sentence shall apply, Acquiror and the Company will make appropriate alternative disclosure
arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with any applicable Legal Requirement. </FONT></P>
