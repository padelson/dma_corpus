AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together with all exhibits and schedules, this "Agreement") is entered into as of February 6, 2017, by and between First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Acquiror"), and First Community Financial Partners, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the "Company"). 

  

    
RECITALS

The boards of directors of the Company and Acquiror have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Acquiror (the "Merger"), with Acquiror as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Entity"). 

  

 B. The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  

 C. As an inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the directors and executive officers of the Company in office as of the date of this Agreement have, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, entered into a Voting and Support Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. 

  

 D. As further inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer has, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, entered into an Employment Agreement, by and among Acquiror, Acquiror Bank and such Chief Executive Officer, which becomes effective as of the Effective Time and governs the terms of continuing employment for such executive. 

  

 E. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the parties also agree to certain prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions. 

  

    
AGREEMENTS 

   

 In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises, covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1 _ The Merger._ Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NRS and the IBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Acquiror pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the NRS and the IBCA, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror will be the Surviving Entity. 

  

 Section 1.2 _ Effective Time; Closing._ 

  

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the offices of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum and Nagelberg LLP, located at 200 West Madison Street, Suite 3900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to 

  

      

  

occur of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at
such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may agree in writing
(the "Closing Date"). Subject to the provisions of Article 10, failure to
consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined
pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination of this
Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this
Agreement.

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada Articles of Merger"), and articles of merger with the Illinois Secretary of State (the "Illinois Articles of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Nevada Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

  

  

 Section 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NRS and the IBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity._ The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 Section 1.5 _ Bank Merger._ The parties will cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined following the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate existence of the Bank will terminate. Acquiror Bank will be the surviving bank and will continue its existence under applicable Legal Requirements. The Bank Merger shall be accomplished pursuant to the statutory bank merger agreement in form attached hereto as Exhibit B. 

  

 Section 1.6 _ Alternative Structure._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties may mutually agree to change the method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , that: (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) require submission to or approval of the Company\'s stockholders after the Merger has been approved by the Company\'s stockholders. If the parties agree to make such a change, they shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. 

  

    
ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

   

 Section 2.1 _ Consideration._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock and subject to Section 2.3, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or Acquiror (in each case other than shares of Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plan or related trust accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be converted into the right to receive (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.396 (the "Exchange Ratio ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of 

  

      

  

Acquiror Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration "); and (ii) $1.35 (the
"Cash Consideration "); provided however, that the Exchange Ratio shall be
subject to adjustment as follows:

    

 (i) if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be less than $22.71, Acquiror shall have the option, in its sole discretion, upon providing notice of its election to the Company within two (2) Business Days of the Determination Date, to adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $8.99 by the Final Acquiror Market Value. 

   

 (ii) if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be less than $22.71, and Acquiror has not exercised its option pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) to adjust the Exchange Ratio within two (2) Business Days of the Determination Date, the Company shall have the option, in its sole discretion, upon providing notice of its election to Acquiror within four (4) Business Days of the Determination Date, to accept the Exchange Ratio without further adjustment. 

  

 (iii) if the Final Acquiror Market Value shall be greater than $35.90, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient obtained by dividing $14.22 by the Final Acquiror Market Value. 

    

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if an adjustment
to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 2.1 would require the Acquiror
to issue more than 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Acquiror
Common Stock at the Effective Time, then Acquiror shall have the right to
adjust the Exchange Ratio so that the Acquiror would only be required to
issue no more than 19.9% of the Acquiror Common Stock, and the Acquiror shall
increase the Cash Consideration to reflect, on a per share basis, the
aggregate value of the total number of shares that otherwise would have been
issuable, valued at the Final Acquiror Market Value.

  

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

   

 "Determination Date" means the first date on which all Requisite Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of the Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period). 

  

 "Final Acquiror Market Value" means the weighted average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date. 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in the Company\'s treasury will be cancelled and no shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, there is declared (with an effective time prior to the Effective Time) or effected a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), split-up or stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible in Acquiror Common Stock), combination, exchange or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Acquiror Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _ Cancellation of Shares._ At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Certificates (it being understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to a book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Company Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes 

        

to represent only the right to receive: (a) evidence of book-entry notation
representing the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which
they were converted pursuant to this Article 2; (b) cash equal to the Cash
Consideration; (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such certificate have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.3, without any
interest thereon; and (d) any dividends or distributions that the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(f).

  

 Section 2.3 _ No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing Acquiror Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled. 

  

 Section 2.4 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent"); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for payment of the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) sufficient cash for payment of the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1; (iii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3; and (iv) sufficient cash for the payment of the Company equity awards as required to pursuant to Section 2.5. Such amount of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the "Conversion Fund." 

  

 (c) Within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), in a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Outstanding Company Shares. 

  

      

  

 (f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such holder\'s Company Common Stock shall have been converted. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest, for issuance of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Consideration, the payment of the Cash Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders\' shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this Article 2, shares of Acquiror Common stock pursuant to the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (i) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and except as set forth in Section 2.5(a)(ii), at the Effective Time, Acquiror shall assume the Company Stock Plans, and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an option award to purchase Acquiror Common Stock with respect to the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan, if any, 

   

      

   

pursuant to which such Company Stock Option was granted and/or any associated
award agreement. It is intended that the conversion of the Company Stock
Options under this Section 2.5(a)(i) shall comply with Sections 409A and 424

The portion of any unvested Company RSUs that does not vest in connection with the Merger shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time. In connection with the cash out of the Company RSUs the Company shall require the holder of such restricted stock units to execute a restricted stock unit cancellation agreement prior to payment of such consideration. 

  

 (c) _ Cash Out of Performance Units._ The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each vested performance unit representing the right to receive one share of Company Common Stock in the future, subject to a performance vesting condition, granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Performance Unit"), including Company Performance Units that vest per their terms due to the Merger (assuming target level of performance through the Effective Time), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a Company Performance Unit and shall be cashed out by virtue of the Merger into an amount of cash for each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Performance Unit equal to the Company Final Closing Price. The portion of any unvested Company Performance Unit that does not vest in connection with the Merger shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time. In connection with the cash out of the Company Performance Units the Company shall require the holder of such performance units to execute a performance unit cancellation agreement prior to payment of such consideration. 

  

 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.5. 

  

  

 Section 2.6 _ Warrants._ At the Effective Time, each warrant issued by the Company on March 12, 2013, in connection with the Company\'s subordinated debentures, due March 12, 2023 (each a "Warrant" and, collectively, the "Warrants"), as listed and described in Section 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a warrant to purchase Acquiror Common Stock with respect to the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock 

        

subject to such Warrant purchasable and receivable immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the terms thereof multiplied by the Warrant
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise
price per share of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the exercise price for each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Warrant Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Warrant. Acquiror and the Company shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to comply with the terms of the Warrants. The Company shall use its
best efforts to cause each holder of a Warrant to exercise such Warrant at or
prior to the Effective Time.

  

 Section 2.7 _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded payment of the fair value for such shares in accordance with the IBCA (collectively, the "Dissenters\' Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the IBCA, except that all Dissenters\' Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights as dissenting stockholders under the IBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of the certificate(s) that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced such shares. The Company shall give Acquiror: (a) prompt notice of any written demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCA and received by the Company relating to stockholders\' dissenters\' rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under the IBCA consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, (x) make any payment with respect to such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any demand for payment of fair value or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair value or timely take any other action to perfect payment of fair value rights in accordance with the IBCA.

 Section 3.7 _ Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory Filings._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company has timely filed all Company SEC Reports, except where the failure to file any Company SEC Report, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and all such Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder which are applicable to the Company. The Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

  

      

  

 (b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Company Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Company Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, CliftonLarsonAllen LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of the Company. 

  

 (c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of the Company, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. 

  

 (d) The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) ("Internal Control Over Financial Reporting"). The Company\'s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of the Company under the Exchange Act (the "Company Evaluation Date"). The Company presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the Company\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Company Evaluation Date. Since the Company Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in the Company\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

 (e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2014, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. 

  

      

  

 (f) To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2014 that would result in a determination that the Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r). 

  

  

 Section 3.8 _ Books and Records._ The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with the Company\'s business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and transactions included therein.

The Company and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the lessor. To the Knowledge of the Company, all buildings and structures owned by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries lie wholly within the boundaries of the real property owned or validly leased by it, and do not encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights of, any other Person. 

  

      

                                    

  

 Section 3.10 _ Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_. 

  

  

 (a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by the Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof (the "Company Loans") reflected as an asset on any of the Company Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of the Company, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines. 

  

 (b) All Company Loans originated or purchased by the Bank were made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of the Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Bank.

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Company Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other Company Benefit Plans, would result in any amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

 (e) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related agreement. 

  

      

  

 (g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Company Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no disqualified person (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406). 

  

 (h) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company or any Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date hereof have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set aside therefor and reflected in Company Financial Statements and (ii) through the Closing Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes will have been set aside therefore and reflected in the Company Financial Statements. 

  

 (i) There are no obligations under any Company Benefit Plans to provide health or other welfare benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors, consultants or their dependents (other than rights under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or comparable state laws). 

  

 (j) No condition exists as a result of which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for the Company or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals participating in Company Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in such Company Benefit Plan. 

  

 (k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have any liabilities to employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Company Benefit Plans.

The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 Section 4.7 _ Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory Filings_. 

  

  

 (a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder which are applicable to the Acquiror. The Acquiror SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained 

  

      

  

an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the
date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC Reports. No
Subsidiary of Acquiror is required to file periodic reports with the SEC
pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  

 (b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the "Acquiror Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, RSM US LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of Acquiror. 

  

 (c) Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries. Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Acquiror\'s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. 

  

 (d) Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquiror\'s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange Act (the "Acquiror Evaluation Date"). Acquiror presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

 (e) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2014, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material 

  

      

  

respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time
they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to
the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date
(but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date.

   

 (f) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2014 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r). 

  

  

 Section 4.8 _ Books and Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with Acquiror\'s business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and transactions included therein. 

  

 Section 4.9 _ Properties_. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, that it purports to own, other than OREO, subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted in the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements and incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for Taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements; (iii) pledges or liens required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of government deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements, securing any discount with, borrowing from, or obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank, interbank credit facilities or any transaction by Acquiror Bank acting in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the present use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair the present business operations at such properties; (v) minor defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held as of the date of this Agreement; (vi) liens or deposits in connection with worker\'s compensation, unemployment insurance, social security or other insurance; (vii) inchoate mechanic\'s and materialmen\'s liens for construction in progress and workmen\'s, repairmen\'s, warehousemen\'s and carrier\'s liens arising in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank consistent with past practice; (viii) liens existing on any asset of any Person at the time such Person is acquired by or is combined with Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, provided the lien was not created in contemplation of that event; (ix) liens on property required by Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve; and (x) liens incidental to the conduct of business or ownership of property of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries which do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of the property or materially impair the use thereof as of the date of this Agreement. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the lessor. 

       

                                    

    

 Section 4.10 _ Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_. 

  

  

 (a) Each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof (the "Acquiror Loans") reflected as an asset on any of the Acquiror Financial Statements or reports filed with the Regulatory Authorities is evidenced by documentation that is customary and legally sufficient in all material respects and constitutes, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or equitable principles or doctrines. 

  

 (b) All Acquiror Loans originated or purchased by Acquiror Bank were made or purchased in accordance with the policies of the board of directors of Acquiror Bank and in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror Bank. Acquiror Bank\'s interest in all Acquiror Loans is free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other charge, and, Acquiror Bank has complied in all material respects with all Legal Requirements relating to such Acquiror Loans. There has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any Acquiror Loan made to an executive officer or director of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank or an entity controlled by an executive officer or director during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof. 

  

 (c) Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis of Acquiror Bank\'s continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Bank\'s internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans. 

  

 (d) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances in excess of Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

 (b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened by any Regulatory Authority.

 Section 4.12 _ Employee Benefits_. 

  

  

 (a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of employment in connection therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit entitlements under any Acquiror Benefit Plan or any other increase in the liabilities of Acquiror or any Subsidiary under any Acquiror Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) With respect to any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional employer organization, such Acquiror Benefit Plan complies in all respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled individuals.

 (d) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (e) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to Acquiror\'s Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Acquiror Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Acquiror Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Acquiror Benefit Plan document or related agreement. 

  

      

  

 (f) No Acquiror Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any liability to any Acquiror Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Acquiror Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights.

To the Knowledge of Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is the owner of any interest in real estate, other than OREO, on which any substances have been generated, used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which substances if known to be present on, at or under such property, would require notification to any Regulatory Authority, clean up, removal or some other remedial action under any Environmental Law at such property or any impacted adjacent or down gradient property, except where such action would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

 Section 4.18 _ Approval Delays._ To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would be denied or unduly delayed. Acquiror Bank\'s most recent CRA rating was "satisfactory" or better.

 Section 7.5 _ Tax Free Reorganization_. 

  

  

 (a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Within forty-five (45) days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall comply with the reporting requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its United States federal income Tax Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason: (i) why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, respectively, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion required by Section 9.8. The Company will deliver such certificates to counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror. 

   

 (c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of any reason: (i) why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, respectively, and Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror would not be able to deliver the opinion required by Section 8.8. Acquiror will deliver such certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company. 

  

  

 Section 7.6 _ Employees and Employee Benefits_ _._ 

  

  

 (a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of 

  

      

  

Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror
shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a
Covered Employee\'s continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

  

 (b) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods (but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. 

  

 (c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s severance policies immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6(e), following the Effective Time, Acquiror or Acquiror\'s Subsidiary will cause any eligible Company employee (exempt and non-exempt) to be covered by a severance policy under which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment will be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth on Section 7.6(d) of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company employee eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by the Merger under an employment, change in control, severance or other agreement (a "CIC Payment") shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this Section 7.6(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits. Any Company employee who waives and relinquishes his or her right to a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in this Section 7.6(d). 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (e) Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for a CIC Payment shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in Section 7.6(d) but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement, provided that, on or before the Closing Date, the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of the CIC Payment shall be reduced such that the value of the Total Payments that each counterparty is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code. 

  

  

 Section 7.7 _ Takeover Laws._ If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal Requirement is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement on the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.8 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (a) any disposition of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions or dispositions of Acquiror Common Stock resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 7.9 _ Stockholder Litigation._ Each of the Company and Acquiror shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

 Section 11.3 _ Assignments, Successors and No Third Party Rights._ Neither party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party.

covenant, agreement and provision hereof shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except for Section 6.5, nothing expressed or referred to
in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.5 without notice
or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

   

 Section 11.4 _ Modification._ This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained; _provided, however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the Company\'s stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable Legal Requirements.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in Article 10, the rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements: (x) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (y) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (z) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.
