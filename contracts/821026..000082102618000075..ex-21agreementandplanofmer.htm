At the Effective Times, by virtue of the Mergers and without any further
action by any other Person:

(a) at the First LGC Effective Time, (i) each unit of Merger Sub 2 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First LGC Effective Time will be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of the surviving entity in the First LGC Merger; (ii) each share of LGC
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First LGC Effective Time
(other than any such shares held in the treasury of LGC, all of which shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto) shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted
into the right of the holder thereof to receive, upon delivery of a validly
executed and duly completed Letter of Transmittal, in a customary form mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Company and not inconsistent with the
terms of the Support Agreement (a "Letter of Transmittal") and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the following: (A) such holder\'s LGC Allocation
Percentage (as set forth on Annex I and Annex IV) multiplied by the result of
(x) the total number of Company Units held by LGC as of immediately prior to
the Final Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Per Unit Closing
Consideration, such amount to be paid in cash and Purchaser Shares based on
the ratio set forth opposite such holder\'s name on Annex I and Annex IV, and
(B) the Additional Merger Consideration payable to such holder (if any);

(b) at the Second LGC Effective Time, (i) each share of the surviving entity
in the First LGC Merger shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable unit of the surviving entity in the Second LGC
Merger and (ii) each unit of Merger Sub 1 shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(c) at the Final Effective Time, each unit of Merger Sub 3 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Final Effective Time will be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable unit of the
Surviving Company;

(d) at the Final Effective Time, each Company Unit that is held in the
treasury of the Company shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(e) at the Final Effective Time, each Company Unit that is held by Purchaser,
its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub 1 (as the surviving entity in the
Second LGC Merger)) or Affiliates as of the Final Effective Time shall be
converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable units
of the Surviving Company which equates to the percentage ownership of Company
Units held by such Persons immediately prior to the Final Effective Time;

(f) at the Final Effective Time, each Company Unit and each Company RMU
(except for the unvested Company RMUs which are being substituted for RSAs
pursuant to Section 1.04(a)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Final Effective Time (other than Company Units and Company RMUs held in the
treasury of the Company and any Company Units and Company RMUs held by
Purchaser, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub 1 (as the surviving entity
in the Second LGC Merger)) or Affiliates) shall be cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive, upon delivery of a
validly executed and duly completed Letter of Transmittal and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the following: (i) an amount equal to the result of
(A) the total number of Company Units and vested Company RMUs held by such
holder as of immediately prior to the Final Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the Per Unit Closing Consideration, such amount to be paid in cash and
Purchaser Shares based on the ratio set forth opposite such holder\'s name on
Annex I and (ii) the Additional Merger Consideration payable to each such
holder (if any); and (g) notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that any holder of Company
Units or vested Company RMUs who would otherwise receive Purchaser Shares in
connection with the Mergers does not deliver to Purchaser satisfactory
evidence that such holder qualifies as an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act, including the investor
questionnaire in the form of Exhibit G hereto (an "Investor Questionnaire"),
within three Business Days prior to Closing then such holder shall receive
only cash consideration and shall not receive any Stock Merger Consideration
and (ii) in the event that the holders of Company Units or vested Company RMUs
set forth on Annex II deliver a duly completed and validly executed Investor
Questionnaire to Purchaser no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing, then, regardless of whether such holders actually qualify as
accredited investors, such holders shall nonetheless be entitled to receive
the Stock Merger Consideration allocable to such holders as set forth on Annex
I, it being understood that the Company may supplement Annex II after the date
hereof with three Business Days\' prior written notice to Purchaser and
provided that the total number of Persons listed thereon shall in no event
exceed 35 Persons.

1.04 Treatment of Company Equity-Based Compensation Awards.

(a) Company RMUs. At the Final Effective Time, the holders of the currently
unvested Company RMUs set forth on Annex III hereto will receive a substituted
restricted stock award ("RSA") as set forth on Annex III. Purchaser will take
all actions necessary to issue the RSAs under The Andersons Inc. 2014 Long-
Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Anderson Incentive Plan") or such other
applicable equity incentive plan, including entering into a Restricted Stock
Award Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereto, with the vesting schedule set
forth on Annex III. The number of Purchaser Shares underlying such RSAs will
be calculated using the Average Purchaser Share Price. Effective as of
immediately prior to the Final Effective Time, the holders of the unvested
Company RMUs set forth on Annex I, shall be converted into the right to
receive the payments and consideration set forth in Section 1.03(f) in the
ratios set forth opposite each such Person\'s name on Annex I, in each case to
the extent consistent with the treatment of Company RMUs under the RMU Plan.

(b) Company UARs. At the Final Effective Time, each then-outstanding and
unexercised In-the-Money Company UAR shall be treated in accordance with the
UAR Plan and as a result of the Closing of the Mergers shall automatically be
cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right of the holder thereof to
receive from the Surviving Company an amount of cash equal to the sum of (i)
product of (A) the total number of Company Units then underlying such In-the-
Money Company UARs, multiplied by (B) the excess of the Per Unit Closing
Consideration over the Base Value with respect to each applicable In-the-Money
Company UAR, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable
withholding and (ii) the Additional Merger Consideration payable to such
holder (if any). Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company to pay the
aggregate amount payable to the holders of such In-the-Money Company UARs
pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, without any interest thereon
and subject to all applicable withholding, upon the later of (x) five Business
Days after the Closing Date and (y) the date of the Surviving Company\'s first regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date. In the event that
(1) the Base Value of any Company UAR is equal to or greater than the Per Unit
Closing Consideration or (2) any Company UAR is, as provided in the UAR Plan,
unvested as of the Final Effective Time, such Company UAR shall automatically
be terminated and cancelled, without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

(c) Company MURs and Company PMURs. At the Final Effective Time, the holders
of the Company MURs set forth on Annex III will receive a substituted RSA from
the Purchaser in the amounts set forth on Annex III. Purchaser will take all
actions necessary to issue the RSAs under the Anderson Incentive Plan or other
applicable equity incentive plan, including entering into a Restricted Stock
Award Agreement in the form of Exhibit E hereto, with the vesting schedule set
forth on Annex III. The number of Purchaser Shares underlying such RSAs will
be calculated using the Average Purchaser Share Price. At the Final Effective
Time, each Company MUR and Company PMUR set forth in Annex I will be treated
in accordance with the MUR Plan and the PMUR Plan, respectively, and as a
result of the Closing of the Mergers shall automatically be cancelled,
extinguished and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive
from the Surviving Company an amount of cash equal to the sum of (i) the
result of (A) the total number of Company Units then underlying such Company
MUR or Company PMUR, as applicable, multiplied by (B) the Per Unit Closing
Consideration and (ii) the Additional Merger Consideration payable to such
holder (if any). Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company to pay the
aggregate amount payable to the holders of such Company MURs and Company PMURs
listed on Annex I pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, without
any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, upon the later
of (x) five Business Days after the Closing Date and (y) the date of the
Surviving Company\'s first regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing Date.

(d) Payment Instructions for Company Equity-Based Awards. As soon as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later
than five Business Days after the date hereof, (i) the Company shall mail or
provide via email to each Person who is a Company UAR Holder, Company MUR
Holder or Company PMUR Holder not receiving an RSA (as provided in Section
1.04(c) above) a letter (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser) describing the treatment of and payment for such equity awards
pursuant to this Section 1.04 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment therefor and (ii) the Company Board or any applicable committee
thereof shall take all such actions as are necessary or advisable to provide
for the treatment of such equity and equity-based awards pursuant to this
Section 1.04 and the full, final and irrevocable termination of the Company
Equity-Based Compensation Plans, Company RMUs, Company UARs, Company MURs and
Company PMURs and extinguishing of all rights and obligations of any party
thereunder, conditioned upon, and effective as of, the Final Effective Time.

(e) Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders. Purchaser and the Company may agree to
treat equity and equity-based compensation held by Company employees subject
to non-U.S. Law in a manner other than that contemplated above in this Section 1.04 to the
extent necessary to take into account applicable non-U.S. Law or Tax or
employment considerations.

(f) EUPP. If the Final Effective Time occurs on or before the "Purchase
Period" relating to the "Accumulation Period" in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (as such terms are defined in the EUPP) and compensation has been
withheld and accumulated with respect to an EUPP participant for the purchase
of Company Units under the EUPP (the "EUPP Investments"), then the Company
Board shall, prior to the Final Effective Time, take such actions as are
necessary to provide that all outstanding EUPP Investments shall be cancelled
as of the Closing Date and that any payroll deductions then credited to
participants\' accounts shall either (i) be applied to purchase Company Units
as part of a final Purchase Period on a date determined by the Company Board,
which date shall not be less than ten days preceding the Closing Date or (ii)
returned to such participants. As soon as practicable, but in any event within
five Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board
shall take all such actions as are required to provide that, (A) no new
Accumulation Periods will commence, nor will any existing Purchase Periods be
extended, following the date of this Agreement; (B) no new individuals will be
permitted to enroll in the EUPP following the date of this Agreement; and (C)
with respect to the Accumulation Period in effect as of the date of this
Agreement no existing participant will be permitted to increase his or her
rate of deductions and purchases following the date of this Agreement. In any
event, the Company Board shall terminate the Company EUPP effective upon the
Final Effective Time.

1.05 Closing.

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing")
shall take place via the electronic exchange of documents and signature pages
on the third Business Day following full satisfaction or waiver of all of the
closing conditions set forth in Article II hereof (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) or on such other date as is mutually agreed upon by
the Purchaser and the Company. The date and time of the Closing are referred
to herein as the "Closing Date." The Closing shall be deemed to be effective

1.07 Paying Agent; Payment Procedures.

(a) The Parties hereby appoint Wilmington Trust, N.A. (in such role, the
"Paying Agent") for the purpose of distributing to the Company Unitholders and
the LGC Stockholders the cash portion of the Per Unit Closing Consideration in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Paying Agent Agreement and this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall cause
each Company Unitholder to be provided with a Letter of Transmittal. Upon
surrender by a Company Unitholder of a Letter of Transmittal duly executed and
completed in accordance with its terms and such other documents required
pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal (collectively, the "Payment Documents"),
at the Closing (in the case of Payment Documents duly completed and delivered
at least three Business Days prior to the Closing) or, if after the Closing,
within three Business Days following receipt of any additional duly executed
and completed Payment Documents, the Paying Agent shall cause each such
Company Unitholder and LGC Stockholder to be paid the cash portion of the Per
Unit Closing Consideration that is payable with respect to the applicable
Company Units as set forth on the Payment Schedule.

(c) From and after the Second LGC Effective Time, the share register and stock
transfer books of LGC shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving company
of the LGC Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Second LGC
Effective Time. (d) From and after the Final Effective Time, the unit ledger and unit transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the unit transfer books of the Surviving Company
of the Company Units and Company RMUs that was outstanding immediately prior
to the Final Effective Time.

(e) Any portion of the amounts paid by Purchaser to the Paying Agent pursuant
to Section 1.06(a) for payment to the Company Unitholders and LGC Stockholders
(the "Payment Fund") which remains undistributed to the Company Unitholders
and LGC Stockholders on the date that is one year after the Final Effective
Time shall be delivered to Purchaser or the Surviving Company (at the
direction of Purchaser), and any Company Unitholders or LGC Stockholders who
have not theretofore complied with this Section 1.07 shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Company (as unsecured creditors thereof) for its
respective portion of the Per Unit Closing Consideration and any other amounts
payable under Section 1.03(a) or Section 1.03(f), as applicable and this
Section 1.07, and Purchaser shall, upon the request of any such former Company
Unitholder after complying with the requirements set forth in this Section
1.07, including delivery of any Payment Documents, promptly pay to such former
Company Unitholder the portion of the Per Unit Closing Consideration and
Additional Merger Consideration, if any, to which such former Company
Unitholder is entitled. None of Purchaser, the Merger Subs, the Company, the
Surviving Company, Sellers Representative or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any amounts payable under this Section 1.07 from
the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to and in full
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company or its
Subsidiaries are required to withhold and deduct any Taxes from the
consideration payable with respect to any of the Company RMUs, such
consideration shall instead be deposited with the Company and paid (subject to
applicable withholding) through the Company\'s payroll system at the first
regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing Date.

1.08 Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth a good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), the Net Indebtedness Amount (the "Estimated Net
Indebtedness Amount") and Company Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses"), and the resulting calculation of the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price. The Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be prepared in
accordance with and in the following order of authority (i) the definitions
set forth in this Agreement and (ii) GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with
the methodologies, practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and
principles used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Purchaser
shall have the right to review and comment upon, and the Company shall
thereafter consider in good faith any of the Purchaser\'s comments with
respect to, the Estimated Closing Statement. (b) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Purchaser a schedule (the "Payment Schedule") setting forth with
respect to each Seller: (i) the name, address of record and e-mail address (if
available) of such Seller, (ii) whether such Seller is a current or former
employee of the Company, (iii) the total number of Company Units, Company
RMUs, Company UARs (including the applicable Base Values with respect
thereto), In-the-Money Company UARs, Company MURs, Company PMURs and shares of
LGC (if applicable) held by such Seller as of immediately prior to the Final
Effective Time, (iv) the aggregate Per Unit Closing Consideration payable to
such Seller, (v) such Seller\'s Allocation Percentage and (vi) such Seller\'s
LGC Allocation Percentage (if applicable). The Payment Schedule shall be
prepared and determined in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement, the
Company Equity-Based Compensation Plans, any agreements between such Seller
and the Company set forth on Schedule 1.08(b) and the organizational and
governing documents of LGC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or any knowledge possessed or acquired by or on behalf of Purchaser,
the Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates, Purchaser, Merger Sub
and, following the Closing, the Surviving Company and their respective
Affiliates shall be entitled to rely on, without any obligation to investigate
or verify the accuracy or correctness thereof, and without any liability, the
allocation of proceeds set forth in the Payment Schedule. An illustrative
example of the Payment Schedule is attached hereto as Annex VI.

(c) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Sellers Representative a statement
showing the Purchaser\'s calculation of Net Working Capital, the Net
Indebtedness Amount and Company Transaction Expenses and the resulting
calculation of the Final Cash Purchase Price (the "Preliminary Closing
Statement"). During the 30 days after delivery of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, the Purchaser shall give the Sellers Representative and its
accountants reasonable access, during normal business hours and without
business disruption, to review the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' books and
records, work papers supporting data and interview relevant personnel related
to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement for purposes of the
Sellers Representative\'s review of the Preliminary Closing Statement. The
Sellers Representative and its accountants may make inquiries of the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries and their respective accountants regarding questions
concerning or disagreements with the Preliminary Closing Statement arising in
the course of its review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use its, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any such accountants to provide reasonable cooperation with and reasonably
promptly respond to such inquiries; provided, however, that the independent
accountants of Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to Sellers Representative unless the Sellers Representative has
signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to
such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such independent accountants. If the Sellers Representative has any objections
to the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative shall deliver
to the Purchaser a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its objections
thereto and the basis for such objections (an "Objections Statement"). If an
Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 30 days after
delivery of the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Preliminary Closing
Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Sellers Representative
and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objections, and all such negotiations related thereto shall be treated as
settlement negotiations under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
any applicable similar state rule, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Sellers Representative and the Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative resolve in writing all such disagreements, the
amounts for Net Working Capital, the Net Indebtedness Amount and Company
Transaction Expenses so agreed in writing by the Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall be final and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the
Parties hereto.

(d) In the event that the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable
to reach a final resolution within 15 Business Days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall
submit such dispute to a nationally recognized certified public accounting or
valuation firm that is non-conflicted and mutually acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative (the "Dispute Resolution Firm"). The Dispute
Resolution Firm shall consider only those items and amounts which are
identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the Sellers
Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution
Firm\'s determination will be based solely on the definitions of Net Working
Capital, Net Indebtedness Amount and Company Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, contained in this Agreement. In resolving any disputed item, the
Dispute Resolution Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party (as set forth on the Preliminary
Closing Statement or Objections Statement, as applicable). The Sellers
Representative and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Firm (who shall be acting as an expert
and not as an arbitrator) to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable
and in any event within 30 days after the submission of any dispute. Further,
the Dispute Resolution Firm\'s determination shall be based solely on the
submissions by the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative which are in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative will cooperate in good faith with the Dispute Resolution Firm
during the term of its engagement. The resolution of the dispute by the
Dispute Resolution Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the
parties hereto and their Affiliates. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Firm shall be allocated based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party in the presentation to the Dispute Resolution Firm.
For example, if the Sellers Representative submits an Objections Statement for
$1,000, and if the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the
Sellers Representative, and if the Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding the Sellers Representative $300 of the $500 contested,
then the costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm will be allocated
60% (i.e. 300/500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages).

(e) Post-Closing Adjustment Payment. (i) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price (such amount, if any, the "Excess Amount"), Purchaser shall
promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after the determination
of the Final Cash Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 1.08) deliver
the Excess Amount to the Paying Agent to be held as the Sellers Representative
Expense Fund.

(ii) If the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Cash Purchase
Price (such amount, if any, the "Shortfall Amount"), then Purchaser shall (A)
deduct from the Working Capital Holdback Amount such Shortfall Amount (and, if
the Working Capital Holdback Amount is less than such Shortfall Amount, then,
deduct, the difference from the General Indemnity Holdback Amount), (B)
deliver to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the former Company
Unitholders and former LGC Stockholders in accordance with their respective
Allocation Percentages and LGC Allocation Percentages) the remaining portion
(if any) of the Working Capital Holdback Amount allocable to the Company Units
and Company RMUs and (C) deliver to the Surviving Company (for further payment
to the former Company UAR Holders (solely with respect to In-the-Money Company
UARs), Company MUR Holders and Company PMUR Holders, in each case accordance
with their respective Allocation Percentages) the remaining portion (if any)
of the Working Capital Holdback Amount allocable to the In-the-Money Company
UARs, Company MURs and Company PMURs.

(iii) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this Section
1.08(e) shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Cash
Purchase Price, and each Party hereto shall file all Tax Returns and act for
all Tax purposes in a manner consistent therewith unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

1.09 Sellers Representative.

(a) Appointment. In addition to the other rights and authority granted to the
Sellers Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, upon and by virtue of the
approval of the LGC Stockholders and the Company Unitholders of this
Agreement, and pursuant to each Letter of Transmittal and Support Agreement
executed and deliver to the Company and Purchaser, all of the Sellers hereby
irrevocably constitute and appoint Sam Freitag as the Sellers Representative,
as their agent and attorney in fact with full power of substitution to act,
from and after the date hereof and to do any and all things and execute any
and all documents on behalf of any Seller that may be necessary, convenient or
appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and/or the other documents and agreements contemplated hereby,

pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) receipt and forwarding of notices and
communications pursuant to this Agreement and the other documents and
agreements contemplated hereby; (iii) administration of the provisions of this
Agreement; (iv) giving or agreeing to, on behalf of any or all of the Sellers,
any and all consents, waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the
Sellers Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the execution or delivery of
any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith;
(v) amending this Agreement or any of the documents, agreements or instruments
to be delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby; (vi) taking actions the Sellers Representative
is expressly authorized to take pursuant to the other provisions of this
Agreement or the other documents and agreements contemplated hereby; (vii) (A)
disputing or refraining from disputing any claim made by the Purchaser under
this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby, (B) negotiating
and compromising, on behalf of each Seller, any dispute that may arise under,
and exercising or refraining from exercising any remedies available under,
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and (C) executing on
behalf of each Seller, any settlement agreement, release or other document
with respect to such dispute or remedy; and (viii) engaging attorneys,
accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of the Sellers in connection with
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees
related thereto.

(b) Reliance. The Purchaser shall be fully protected in dealing with the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement and may rely upon the authority of
the Sellers Representative to act on behalf of the Sellers. Any payment by the
Purchaser to the Sellers Representative shall be considered a payment by the
Purchaser to the Sellers. The appointment of the Sellers Representative is
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any Seller in any manner
or for any reason. This power of attorney shall not be affected by the death,
illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to act of the
principal pursuant to any applicable law.

(c) Acts of the Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative may not
resign from his capacity as the Sellers Representative at any time without the
Purchaser\'s prior written consent. In the event Sam Freitag no longer serves
as the Sellers Representative, the Sellers may, by majority vote based on the
voting power immediately prior to the Closing, select a replacement Sellers
Representative.

(d) Expenses and Liabilities. Any expenses or liabilities incurred by the
Sellers Representative in connection with the performance of his duties under
this Agreement or the other documents and agreements contemplated hereby shall
not be the personal obligation of the Sellers Representative but shall be
payable by the Sellers based on their respective Allocation Percentage;
provided that the Sellers Representative shall first satisfy any such expenses
or liabilities by using funds from the Sellers Representative Admin Expense
Fund. The Sellers Representative shall provide the Sellers with an accounting
of all expenses paid from the Sellers\' Representative Admin Expense Fund upon
final distribution of the General Indemnity Holdback Amount. The Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to use and apply the funds in the Sellers
Representative Admin Expense Fund to reimburse or indemnify himself from and
against any costs, fees, expenses and Losses (including compensation for his
time at a reasonable rate not to exceed $500.00 per hour), and to the extent
that the Sellers Representative determines (in his sole discretion) that no
further amounts are necessary to be held by the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers Representative shall (i) deliver to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the former Company Unitholders and former LGC Stockholders in accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages
and LGC Allocation Percentages) the portion of the Sellers Representative
Admin Expense Fund allocable to the Company Units and Company RMUs and (ii)
deliver to the Surviving Company (for further payment to the former Company
UAR Holders (solely with respect to In-the-Money Company UARs), Company MUR
Holders and Company PMUR Holders, in each case accordance with their
respective Allocation Percentages) the portion of the Sellers Representative
Admin Expense Fund allocable to the In-the-Money Company UARs, Company MURs
and Company PMURs.

(e) Indemnification of the Sellers Representative. The Sellers shall
severally, but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless, pro rata based on
each Seller\'s Allocation Percentage, the Sellers Representative from any and
all losses, liabilities and expenses (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the Sellers
Representative\' execution and performance (solely in its capacity as the
Sellers Representative and not in its capacity as a Seller) of this Agreement.
All of the indemnitees, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers
Representative under this Agreement will survive the date of this Agreement or
any termination of this Agreement.

(f) Limitation on Liability. Neither the Sellers Representative nor any of its
representatives will be liable to any Seller relating to the performance of
the Sellers Representative\'s duties and obligations under this Agreement or
any other agreements contemplated herein or for any errors in judgment,
negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise, except to the extent it is
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by clear and
convincing evidence that any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or
expense is actually incurred by such person as a proximate result of the
willful misconduct of the Sellers Representative (it being understood that any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of the Sellers Representative\'s good faith and reasonable
judgment). The Sellers Representative will be fully protected in acting upon
any notice, statement or certificate believed by the Sellers Representative to
be genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate Person and in acting
or refusing to act on any matter unless such belief constitutes willful
misconduct. The Sellers Representative is serving in that capacity solely for
purposes of administrative convenience, and is not liable in such capacity or
any other capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and
Purchaser agrees that it will in no event look to the personal assets of the
Sellers Representative, acting in such capacity or any other capacity, for the
satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers.

1.10 No Further Rights of Transfer.

At and after the Final Effective Time, (a) each Seller shall cease to have any
rights as a direct or indirect equityholder or equity-based award holder of
the Company or LGC, except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except
for the right of each Seller to deliver a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal or applicable payment documentation in exchange for payment of
the portion of the Per Unit Closing Consideration such Seller is entitled to
pursuant to this Agreement in the manner and at the times set forth herein and (b) no transfer of shares
of LGC or Company Units, Company RMUs, Company UARs, Company MURs or Company
PMURs shall be made on the transfer books of the Surviving Company.
Immediately after the Final Effective Time, the unit ledger of the Company and
the share register of LGC shall be closed.

1.11 Withholding.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser or its
designee and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to withhold
and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Purchaser or its designee or the Company and its Subsidiaries
are required by law to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations or any provision of
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

1.12 Taking of Further Action.

If, at any time after the Final Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub 1, Purchaser and the Surviving Company are fully authorized in their
respective names to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or
desirable action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

Property, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except Permitted
Liens, (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.07(c), neither the Company nor

structural deficiencies or latent defects.

and authorizations (collectively, the "Real Property Permits") of all

other entities having jurisdiction over the Real Property, which are required
to use or occupy the Real Property or operate the Business on the Real
Property as currently conducted, have been issued and are in full force and
effect, except for any Real Property Permit the failure of which to be issued
or to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.07(e) lists all material Real
Property Permits held by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to each
Real Property. The Company has delivered or otherwise made available to
Purchaser true and complete copies of all Real Property Permits obtained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business. The
Company has not received any written notice from any Governmental Authority or
other entity having jurisdiction over the Real Property threatening a
suspension, revocation, modification or cancellation of any Real Property
Permit and, to the Company\'s knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for the
issuance of any such notice or the taking of any such action. The transactions
contemplated hereby will not adversely affect the Purchaser\'s ability to
continue to operate the Business under the material Real Property Permits
without the consent or approval of the issuing Governmental Authority or
entity, and no disclosure, filing or other action by the Company is required
in connection herewith, and Purchaser shall not be required to assume any

to provide access to, or to disclose any information to, the Sellers
Representative or a Seller if such access or disclosure in the reasonable
judgment of legal counsel to the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of

which the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party and (z) the Sellers Representative or any such Seller shall treat as

pension, deferred compensation, equity or equity-based, or post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits) provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries under
the Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule 3.13(a) (excluding any defined benefit
pension, deferred compensation, equity or equity-based, or post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits) to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
date hereof or are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits
provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees.
Purchaser agrees to pay the incentive bonuses for the Company 2018 incentive
plan in the form and amounts set forth on Schedule 6.05(a).

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall obligate Purchaser, the

service provider to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period of
time after the Closing, and this Section 6.05 shall not be construed to limit
the ability of Purchaser, the Surviving Company, or any of the Surviving
Company\'s Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee of, or the
service relationship of any other service provider to, the Surviving Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing in accordance with applicable

agreement, Contract, policy, or arrangement of Purchaser, the Surviving
Company, or any of the Surviving Company\'s Subsidiaries. (c) Purchaser shall deliver, as of the Final Effective Time, the retention
bonuses in the form and amount as set forth on Schedule 6.05(c). As an

(ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) through Section 8.01(b)(vi) in

of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i) through Section 8.01(b)(vi), and once the General Indemnity

against the Sellers for any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section

returned, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no further rights to

made directly by any Seller in any agreement, document or certificate
delivered pursuant hereto, including any Letter of Transmittal, Support
Agreement or Management Restrictive Covenant Agreement; provided that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Seller shall only be
liable for his, her or its individual breaches of any such directly made
representations, warranties or covenants and shall not be liable for breaches
of any other Seller\'s representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
any Letter of Transmittal, Support Agreement or Management Restrictive

8.01(d), breaches of representations and warranties in Article III and Article
IV, as applicable, and the calculation of any Losses relating thereto will be
determined without giving effect to any Materiality Exception, except that
such qualification shall not be readout of any defined term that incorporates
materiality (e.g. "Material Contract");

(viii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.01 shall modify, affect, waive any
rights with respect to or otherwise impact the rights, entitlements,
privileges or recovery of any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under the
Special Indemnity Insurance Policy (if any), including the ability of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to seek recovery against the Special Indemnity
Insurance Policy in excess of the limitations set forth herein. (e) Determination of Loss; Mitigation.

(i) The amount of any indemnifiable Losses under Section 8.01(b) shall be
calculated net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee or any
Affiliate thereof with respect thereto from any third party (net of any
collection costs) or under, or pursuant to, any insurance policy (other than
the Special Indemnity Insurance Policy). If, after an Indemnitee has received
indemnification payments pursuant to Section 8.01(b), such Indemnitee (or its
Affiliates) actually recovers cash (net of any collection costs) under, or
pursuant to, any insurance policy (other than the Special Indemnity Insurance
Policy) or from any third party relating to the claim or matter for which an
indemnification payment was previously received, then such Indemnitee shall
promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitor(s) the amount of such proceeds (up
to the amount of the prior payments to such Indemnitee by such Indemnitor(s)).

(ii) The amount of any indemnifiable Loss under Section 8.01(b) shall be
calculated by subtracting the amount of the Tax benefit arising from the
incurrence or payment of any Loss actually realized by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party in the taxable year such Loss is incurred, as calculated on
a with and without basis.

(iii) Except with respect to the matters specified on Section 8.01(b)(vii),
each party hereto shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any of
its Losses as promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise to an
indemnification claim under this Section 8.01.

(iv) No party shall be entitled to any recovery in respect of a Loss (or a
part thereof) to the extent the matter underlying the Loss (i) has been
adequately and appropriately reserved for and reflected in Net Working Capital
as finally determined under this Agreement and (ii) such reserve amount
actually resulted in an adjustment to the Final Cash Purchase Price. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event a Loss exceeds the applicable reserve amount
reflected in Net Working Capital, then the party suffering such Loss may seek
recovery for such excess Losses.

(v) Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which
an indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. An Indemnitee shall not be
entitled to recover more than once, directly or indirectly, for the same Loss.

(f) Manner of Payment. Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall
be effected by a deduction from the General Indemnity Holdback Amount or the
Special Indemnity Holdback Amount by Purchaser, as applicable or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds from the Purchaser, as the case may
be, to an account designated in writing by the Seller Indemnified Party, as may be, within five days after a determination thereof that is binding on the
Indemnitor; provided that, nothing herein shall limit the ability of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to seek recovery against the Special Indemnity
Holdback Amount or the Special Indemnity Insurance Policy, at their
discretion.

(g) Defense of Third Party Claims. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under this Section 8.01 (any such Person, an "Indemnitee")
shall notify the indemnifying party (such party, an "Indemnitor") of the claim
in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any Claim against it (if
by a third party) in no event later than ten Business Days after such
Indemnitee becomes aware of such third party claim, describing the Claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; provided,
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent, and then only to the
extent, the Indemnitor shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Claim giving rise to an Indemnitee\'s claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitor\'s expense, and at its option (subject to
the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof by appointing a counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be
the lead counsel in connection with such defense (with the fees and expenses
of such counsel being borne by the Indemnitor); provided, that prior to the
Indemnitor assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to the
Indemnitee in writing that such Indemnitor shall be fully responsible (with no
reservation of any rights) for all Losses relating to such claim for
indemnification and that it shall provide full indemnification (whether or not
otherwise required hereunder) to the Indemnitee with respect to such Claim
giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.01(d); and provided, further, that:

(i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
proceeding or other claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; provided, that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall
be borne by the Indemnitee (other than any fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnitor has notified the
Indemnitee that it intends to assume control of such defense which,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnitor, and except
that the Indemnitor shall pay all of the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel if the Indemnitee has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee);

(ii) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnitee) and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee if (1) the
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
or quasi-criminal Claim; (2) the Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnitee; (3) the Indemnitee has been advised by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitee; (4) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend such Claim; (5) the Claim is related to Taxes; or (6) the
Indemnitee reasonably believes that the Losses relating to the third-party
Claim would not exceed the Threshold Amount or would exceed the maximum amount
that the Indemnitee could then be entitled to recover for such Claim under the
applicable provisions of Section 8.01(d);

(iii) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such Claim, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, before
entering into any settlement of such Claim if, pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against
the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally
release the Indemnitee from all liabilities (monetary or otherwise) with
respect to such Claim, with prejudice;

(iv) if the Indemnitee is a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any
third-party Claim, the Indemnitee may not settle or compromise any third-party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment in favor of any third party with
respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative, acting on behalf of the
Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
and

(v) the Indemnitee (if the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a third-party
Claim) or the Indemnitor (if the Indemnitor has not or is not permitted to
assume the defense of a third-party Claim) shall reasonably assist and
cooperate in good faith in managing such defense. Such assistance and
cooperation shall include retaining and providing reasonable access during
normal business hours to (y) all books, records and other documents (including
relevant work papers, memoranda, financial statements, Tax Returns, Tax
schedules and work papers, Tax rulings, and other determinations, etc., in
each case, of the Company or its Subsidiaries) relating to or containing
information relevant to such claim in their possession and (z) employees,
accountants and other professional advisors; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the defense of
matters set forth on Schedule 8.01(b)(vii) shall be conducted as described on
Schedule 8.01(g)(vi) and (B) the Specified Tax Matters shall be addressed in
the manner set forth on Schedule 8.01(b)(iv).

(h) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of Losses which do
not result from a thirdâ€‘party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by
giving the Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice thereof (such notice, a
"Direct Claim Notice"). A Direct Claim Notice will describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail and indicate the estimated amount of Losses (if known and
quantifiable) that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining
the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include retaining and providing the Sellers
Representative and their Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to (y) all books, records and other documents (including

chief financial officer, accountants and attorneys reasonably available to
respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Sellers Representative
and their Representatives). The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may discuss such
Direct Claim for a period of 30 days from the date the Indemnitor receives
such Direct Claim Notice (such period, or such longer period as agreed in
writing by the parties, is hereinafter referred to as the "Discussion
Period"), and all such discussions (unless otherwise agreed by the Indemnitee
and the Indemnitor) shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar Law. If the Direct Claim that is the
subject of the Direct Claim Notice has not been resolved prior to the
expiration of the Discussion Period, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee may
submit the dispute for resolution to a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Sections 10.11 and 10.16 hereof and each will be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to them on the terms and subject to
the provisions of this Agreement.

information concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which

public owned company, including to securities analysts and institutional
investors and in press interviews. In the event that any such additional press
release, public announcement or public filing is required by or advisable
under applicable Law or stock exchange rules, the party obligated to make such
press release, public announcement or public filing shall use commercially
reasonably efforts to provide the other party with reasonable advance notice
of such requirement and the content of the proposed press release,
announcement or filing and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such release, announcement or filing and consider in good faith any comments

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby subsequent to the execution
of this Agreement.

10.04 Assignment.

This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by either the
Purchaser or any Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, LGC or the
Sellers Representative, on the other hand, without the prior written consent
of the other party; provided that Purchaser and any Merger Sub may, without
the consent of any Person, assign in whole or in part their rights, interests
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to (i) one or more of their
Affiliates, (ii) after the Closing, any purchaser of all or substantially all
of the assets of such assignor or (iii) any of their lender(s) as collateral
security; provided, further that, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser or such Merger Sub of
any of its obligations hereunder.

10.05 Severability.

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

10.06 References.Capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective
meanings assigned thereto herein (such definitions to be equally applicable to
both the singular and plural forms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of the terms defined). A term defined as one part
of speech (such as a noun) shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The table
of contents and the section and other headings and subheadings contained in
this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely for the purpose of
reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto, and shall not
in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any
exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be deemed references to
calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be deemed references to
United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to
a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to
refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule
to this Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
English shall be the governing language of this Agreement. The word
"including" shall mean "including, without limitation". "Shall" and "will"
mean "must," and shall and will have equal force and effect and express an
obligation. "Writing," "written" and comparable terms refer to printing,
typing, and other means of reproducing in a visible form. References herein to
this Agreement mean this Agreement as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including by waiver or consent. All references to materials
being "made available" by the Company means documents posted and accessible to
Purchaser and its advisors in the electronic data room for "Project Brisket"
hosted by Husch Blackwell at least one Business Day prior to the date hereof
and remained so posted and accessible continuously through the Closing. All
references to the "ordinary course of business" of a particular Person or
similar phrases shall mean the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices of such Person and its Subsidiaries (including with respect to
timing, frequency and magnitude).

10.07 Construction.

The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen
by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any
item in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that
the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including, without limitation,
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or
Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement or in
any Schedule or Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed (including
whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary of business for purposes
of this Agreement. The information contained in this Agreement and in the
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed
to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of law or breach of
Contract).

10.08 Amendment and Waiver.

This Agreement may be amended, and any provision of this Agreement may be
waived; provided, that any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon the
parties hereto only if such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing
executed by the parties hereto, and any such amendment or waiver shall be
binding upon the Company, the Purchaser and the Merger Subs only if such
amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by the Company, the
Purchaser or the Merger Subs, as the case may be. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any
way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

10.09 Complete Agreement.

This Agreement and the documents referred to herein (including the
Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement between the parties
hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the
subject matter hereof in any way.

10.10 Third-Party Beneficiaries.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under
or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the DandO Indemnified Persons are intended beneficiaries
of, and shall have the right to enforce, the provisions set forth in Section
6.03.

10.11 Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ANY RIGHT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING (I) ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR (II) ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

10.12 Specific Performance.Each of the Company, LGC, the Purchaser and the
Merger Subs acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged
irreparably in the event any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, each
of the Company, LGC, the Purchaser and the Merger Subs agrees that the other
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court in
the United States or in any state having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled pursuant
hereto. If the Closing shall not have occurred because of a breach by the
Purchaser or any Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement, and all
of the conditions set forth in Section 2.01 to the Purchaser\'s and the Merger
Subs\' obligations have either been satisfied or previously waived in writing
(or would have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied but for such
breach of the Purchaser\'s or such Merger Sub\'s obligations under this
Agreement), then the Company shall have the right to a court order
specifically enforcing the provisions of this Agreement as to which such
breach applies and, in any event, to specifically force the Closing to occur.
If the Closing shall not have occurred because of a breach by any of the
Company or LGC of its obligations under this Agreement, and all of the
conditions set forth in Section 2.02 to the Company\'s obligations have either
been satisfied or previously waived in writing (or would have been satisfied
or are capable of being satisfied but for such breach of the Company\'s or
LGC\'s obligations under this Agreement), then the Purchaser and the Merger
Subs shall have the right to a court order specifically enforcing the
provisions of this Agreement as to which such breach applies and, in any
event, to specifically force the Closing to occur.

10.13 Delivery.

This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or
contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic mail, shall
be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or in electronic or digital form as a defense to the formation of a contract
and each such party forever waives any such defense. 10.14 Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which need
not contain the signature of more than one party, but all such counterparts
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.15 Governing Law.

All Claims, issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and
schedules hereto (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any Claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within
such State, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

10.16 Consent to Jurisdiction.

SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1.08 (WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE
ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY
SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED HEREUNDER SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY
FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN DELAWARE. EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES NOT TO
BRING ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS
IMPOSED HEREUNDER IN ANY OTHER COURT. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION, OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE
PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN
IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR
PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR
REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH
COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM,
WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE 10.17 Payments under this Agreement.

Each party agrees that all amounts required to be paid hereunder shall be paid
in United States currency and, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, without discount, rebate, reduction or withholding and not subject
counterclaim or offset, on the dates required hereby (with time being of the
essence).
