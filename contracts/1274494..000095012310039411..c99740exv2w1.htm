of the delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Member Representative shall
deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Payout Schedule_ ") showing (i) the
number of Interests to be outstanding (whether vested or unvested)
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the owners thereof and (ii)
the allocation of the Base Purchase Price (before adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.04(e)_) among such owners. Such Payout Schedule shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon all Members. 

  

3.02 _Effects on Interests_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Member or the owners of the Equity
Interests of Merger Sub: 

  

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding Equity Interest of Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become an Equity Interest of the Surviving
Entity.

shall be converted into the right to receive (i) a portion of the Base
Purchase Price determined in accordance with _Section 6.06_ of the LLC
Agreement (but assuming that all of the Base Purchase Price is available for
distribution to the Members), which amount shall be set forth in the Payout
Schedule (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), plus (ii) a pro rata share of the

3.04(e)_ less (iii) in the case of the ECP Members only, a pro rata share of
the cash payment, if any, to be made by the ECP Members pursuant to _Section
3.04(e)_. The cash payable upon the conversion of the Interests (whether
vested or unvested) pursuant to this _Section 3.02(b)_ is referred to
collectively as " _Merger Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all
Interests (whether vested or unvested) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Interests (whether vested or unvested) shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such holders
portion of the Merger Consideration. 

   

3.03 _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

(a) All Cash Consideration to be paid to the ECP Members shall be paid by
Parent at the Closing by wire transfer of cash in immediately available funds
in the amounts and to the accounts set forth in the Payout Schedule. 

  

(b) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
mail to each Non-ECP Member, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
such form and have such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, including (A) representations and warranties of such Non-ECP Member
substantially similar to those contained in _ARTICLE V_ and (B) an agreement
by the Non-ECP Members to be bound by the terms of _ARTICLE XII_ ), 

  

    ##### 

  

   

(each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), (ii) an affidavit of such Non-ECP
Member, in the form set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv), setting forth such Non-ECP Members name, address and
taxpayer identification number and stating under the penalties of perjury that
such Non-ECP Member is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section
1445 of the Code and (iii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Interests in exchange for such Non-ECP Members portion of the Merger
Consideration. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal and affidavit to
Parent, duly executed, the Non-ECP Member shall be entitled to receive, upon
the later to occur of the Closing or the date such Non-ECP Member delivers
such Letter of Transmittal and affidavit to Parent, in exchange for his or
her Interests an amount of cash equal to the portion of the Cash
Consideration that the holder of such Interests is entitled to receive
pursuant to  _Section 3.02(b)_, and the Interests so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.03(b)_, each Interest of a Non-ECP Member shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
each holders portion of the Cash Consideration as contemplated by this 
_ARTICLE III_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Interests. 

  

(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE III_  upon conversion of any Interests (whether vested or unvested)
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Interests (whether vested or unvested), and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
transfer books of the Surviving Entity of Interests (whether vested or
unvested) that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

(d) Parent shall be entitled to withhold and pay to the pertinent Tax
Authority any and all Taxes required to be withheld by Applicable Law from
the payments of the Merger Consideration. Any withheld amounts shall, to the
extent timely paid over to the pertinent Tax Authority, be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as if they had been paid to the affected Member. 

   

3.04 _Adjustments to Cash Purchase Price_. 

  

(a) A representative designated by the ECP Members (the " _Member
Representative_ ") shall, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a statement (the "
_Preliminary Statement_ ") setting forth the Member Representatives good
faith estimates of (i) the Debt Obligations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries outstanding on the Closing Date but immediately prior to
the Closing (other than indebtedness owed to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries) (the " _Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash
Equivalents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
but immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Date Cash_ "), (iii) the
amount of all unpaid Transaction Expenses on the Closing Date but immediately
prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (iv) the
amount of Development and Other Expenses (the " _Estimated Development and
Other Expenses_ "), (v) the aggregate amount of Prorated Company 2010 Bonuses
paid to Company Employees on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Prorated 2010
Bonuses_ ") and (vi) to the extent applicable, the Payables Amount (the "
_Estimated Payables Amount_ "). The estimates of Closing Date Indebtedness and
Closing Date 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Cash provided in the Preliminary Statement are referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ " and the " _Estimated Closing Date
Cash_ ", respectively. 

  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Member Representative a statement (the "
_Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculations of Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Transaction Expenses, Development and Other
Expenses, Prorated Company 2010 Bonuses, True-Up Payables Amount, Payables
Amount and the Payables Offset. At the same time, Parent shall also cause to
be prepared and delivered to the Member Representative a statement (the "
_Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the calculations (in each case
whether a positive or negative number) of (i) the amount of the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness minus the Closing Date Indebtedness as shown on the
Statement, (ii) the amount of the Closing Date Cash as shown on the
Statement minus the Estimated Closing Date Cash, (iii) the amount of
Estimated Transaction Expenses minus the Transaction Expenses as shown on the
Statement, (iv) the amount of Development and Other Expenses as shown on the
Statement minus the Estimated Development and Other Expenses, (v) the amount
of Prorated Company 2010 Bonuses as shown on the Statement minus the
Estimated Prorated 2010 Bonuses and (vi) the True-Up Payables Amount. The sum
of the amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi)
above, whether a positive or negative number, is referred to hereinafter as
the " _Adjustment Amount_ ". Parent shall provide the Member Representative
and its accountants with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours, to the relevant books and records and employees
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent required in
connection with its review of and any dispute with respect to the Statement
and the Adjustment Statement and shall furnish the Member Representative with
any other information that might be relevant to the calculation of Closing
Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash, Transaction Expenses, Development and
Other Expenses, Prorated Company 2010 Bonuses, and True-Up Payables Amount,
but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. 

  

(c) After receipt of the Statement and the Adjustment Statement, the Member
Representative will have thirty (30) days from receipt to review the
Statement and the Adjustment Statement together with the workpapers used in
their preparation. Unless the Member Representative delivers to Parent
written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the specific items disputed
by the Member Representative and a written statement setting forth the Member
Representatives calculation of each line item shown on the Statement so
disputed and the amount in dispute (the " _Member Representative Statement_
") on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Statement
and the Adjustment Statement, the Member Representative will be deemed to
have accepted and agreed to the Statement and the Adjustment Statement and
such agreement will be final, binding and conclusive. Any items on the
Statement or Adjustment Statement as to which the Member Representative has
not given notice of its objection and provided an alternative calculation on
the Member Representative Statement will be deemed to have been agreed upon
by the Parties. If the Member Representative so notifies Parent of its
objections to any of the Statement or the Adjustment Statement and provides
Parent with the Member Representative Statement in a timely manner, Parent
and the Member Representative will, within thirty (30) calendar days following
such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their
differences. Any resolution by Parent and the Member Representative during
the Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and
conclusive. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) If Parent and the Member Representative do not resolve all disputed items
by the end of the Resolution Period, then all items remaining in dispute will
be submitted within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Resolution
Period to Grant Thornton LLP or such other national independent accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Member Representative (the "
_Neutral Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall
act as an arbitrator to determine only those items in dispute and, in the
event that either Parent or the Member Representative fails to submit its
statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time determined
by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator, then the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator by Parent or the Member
Representative, as applicable. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator will be allocated
between Parent, on the one hand, and the ECP Members, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion as they shall prevail on the amounts of such disputed
items so submitted (as finally determined by the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator). The Neutral Accounting Arbitrator will deliver to Parent and the
Member Representative a written determination (such determination to include
a work sheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator by the Member Representative and Parent) of the
disputed items within thirty (30) days of receipt of the disputed items (or
as soon as practicable thereafter), which determination will be final, binding
and conclusive. The final, binding and conclusive Statement and Adjustment
Statement, which either are agreed upon by Parent and the Member
Representative, not objected to by the Member Representative or are delivered
by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with this
_Section 3.04(d)_ , will be the " _Conclusive Statement_ " and the "
_Conclusive Adjustment Statement_ ," respectively. 

  

(e) If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement
(the " _Conclusive Adjustment Amount_ ") is a negative number, then the Base
Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount of the Conclusive Adjustment
Amount and each ECP Member shall pay in cash to Parent its pro rata share
(based on the payment received by it as a percentage of all payments received
by all ECP Members as set forth on the Payment Schedule) of such amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent prior to the date when such payment is due.
If the Conclusive Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Base
Purchase Price will be increased by the amount of the Conclusive Adjustment
Amount and Parent shall pay in cash to the Member Representative the
Conclusive Adjustment Amount and the Member Representative shall distribute
to each Member its pro rata share (based on the payment received by it as a
percentage of all payments received by all Members as set forth on the
Payment Schedule) of such amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Members prior to
the date when such payment is due. All payments to be made pursuant to this
_Section 3.04(e)_ will be made on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the date on which Parent and the Member Representative agree to, or
the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Statement and the
Conclusive Adjustment Statement. 

   

3.05 _Allocation of Consideration for Tax Purposes_. 

  

(a) The Base Purchase Price, plus any assumed liabilities, to the extent
properly taken into account under the Code, shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company 

  

    ##### 

  

   

and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of
state or local law, as appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation
shall be delivered by Parent to the Member Representative within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date for the Member Representatives review. Parent
and the Member Representative shall work in good faith to resolve any
disputes relating to the Allocation. If Parent and the Member Representative
are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days following the
delivery of the Allocation by Parent to the Member Representative, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in a manner
consistent with the procedures set forth in _Section 3.04(d)_. 

  

(b) If the Base Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.04(e)_, the
Allocation shall be adjusted as appropriate in a manner in accordance with
the procedures set forth in  _Section 3.05(a)_. Parent and the Member
Representative shall cooperate in good faith in making any such adjustments
to the Allocation. 

  

(c) The Parties shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the Allocation.
None of the Parties shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such
Allocation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
prevent any Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and no Party shall
be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment
by any Tax Authority challenging such Allocation. 

  

3.06 _Tax Characterization_. The Parties acknowledge that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 CB 432, the
Merger is, and shall be treated by the Parties as, a sale of the Interests by
the Members and the purchase of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries by Parent.

its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (2) have a material impact on the Company or the
Companys ability to develop the Projects.

any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or
regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely

7.04 _Employees; Employee Benefits_. 

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor, pay, perform and
satisfy any and all Liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to or in
respect of all current and former employees and Non-ECP Members (including
those individuals who are full-time, part-time, temporary, on vacation or on
a paid or unpaid leave of absence) (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
of the Company and any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company
Employees_ ") arising under the terms of each Company Employee Benefit Plan
(other than any Company Employee Benefit Plan providing equity compensation
or any plan required to be terminated under the first sentence of  _Section
7.04(e)_), as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, for as long as
such Company Employee Benefit Plan is in effect, including with respect to
any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "employ", "employment" and
similar variations thereof (including references to the termination thereof)
shall be deemed to refer to the service relationship between the Non-ECP
Members and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, regardless of whether any
such Non-ECP Member is considered an employee for tax purposes. 

  

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on a date not
less than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), subject to  _Section 7.04(e)_, Parent shall provide
each Company Employee with cash compensation (base salary or hourly rate and
annual target bonus) that is at least equal to such cash compensation of such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and benefits that are
not less favorable in the aggregate than the aggregate benefits provided to
similarly situated employees at the Parent as of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall continue to
maintain for the benefit of the Company Employees (and any dependents or
beneficiaries thereof), and shall cause the Company Employees (and any
dependents or beneficiaries thereof) to remain eligible to participate in,
each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan from the
Closing Date through the end of the plan year of the corresponding welfare
benefit plan maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries to the extent the
Company Employees continue to satisfy the eligibility provisions of the
applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. 

  

(c) Except with respect to any Company Employee who is subject to an Executive
Agreement that provides a severance benefit equal to at least six (6) months
of base salary in the event of a termination of employment without Cause,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on a date not
less than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, if Parent or
its Affiliates terminates the employment of a Company Employee (other than
for Cause), Parent shall maintain a severance program providing an aggregate
benefit (taking into consideration all other severance arrangements,
including under the Executive Agreements) at least equal to six (6) months of
base salary (payable in a form to be determined by the Company) to any Company
Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Parent or its
Affiliates without Cause, subject to such Company Employees execution of a
valid release of claims in favor of the Company, Parent and
their Affiliates. 

  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause each Company
Employees service prior to the Closing Date with the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

any predecessor thereof, to be treated as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes (including to determine eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, and vesting) under any employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements of Parent and its subsidiaries in which
Company Employees may be eligible to participate from and after the Closing
Date (including with respect to any vacation, paid time-off and severance
benefits), to the same extent such service was recognized under the
Company Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
(e.g., under an incentive compensation plan). With respect to any
welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries for the
benefit of Company Employees (and any dependents or beneficiaries thereof)
from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause such plans to (i) waive
any preexisting condition limitations and exclusions to the extent
such restrictions were waived immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
recognize service with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for purposes
of any actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods and other similar
restrictions with respect to the Company Employees (or any dependents
or beneficiaries thereof) and (iii) recognize all co-payments, deductibles
and other similar expenses incurred by the Company Employees (or any
dependents or beneficiaries thereof) during the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs, to the extent such expenses were recognized immediately
prior to the Closing Date. 

  

(e) Effective as of the Closing, the Company shall terminate and satisfy all
liabilities under all Company Employee Benefit Plans that are annual or other
cash incentive compensation plans;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this  _Section 7.04(e)_ shall affect
the obligations of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.04(f)_ or under any Executive Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any obligation to provide an annual cash bonus
target) or the obligations of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent
to pay the Prorated Company 2010 Bonuses and Prorated Parent 2010 Bonuses in
accordance with the remainder of this _Section 7.04(e)_, in each case other
than any obligation to continue any plan required to be terminated pursuant to
this sentence. The Company shall pay or cause to be paid to each Company
Employee set forth on _Annex B_ , subject to such Company Employees
continued employment with the Company or a Company Subsidiary through the
Closing, a bonus in the amount set forth on _Annex B_ opposite such
Company Employees name, multiplied by a fraction (x) the numerator of which
is equal to the number of days elapsed from January 1, 2010 through the
Closing Date during which the Company Employee is employed by the Company or
a Company Subsidiary, and (y) the denominator of which is 365 (a "
_Prorated Company 2010 Bonus_ "). Each such Prorated Company 2010 Bonus shall
be paid in a single lump sum cash payment at the Closing. For 2010, Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to each Company Employee set forth on _Annex B_
, subject to such Company Employees continued employment with Parent or any
of its subsidiaries (including the Company) through December 31, 2010, a bonus
in an amount determined under Parents 2010 bonus plan applicable to
similarly-situated employees (but with a target bonus amount at least equal
to such Company Employees target bonus amount in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date under the applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan
(including as specified in any Executive Agreement)) and with no requirement
that the Company Employee be employed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(other than the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) at any time prior to the
Closing Date), multiplied by a fraction (x) the numerator of which is equal
to the number of days elapsed from the day immediately following the Closing
Date through December 31, 2010, and (y) the denominator of which is 365 (a "
_Prorated Parent 2010 Bonus_ "). 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Any Company Employee set forth on _Annex B_ whose employment is
involuntarily terminated without Cause, or resigns for Good Reason (whether
or not the Company Employee is listed on _Schedule 7.04(e))_, during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2010 shall be
eligible to receive a Prorated Parent 2010 Bonus in the same amount as if
such Company Employee had remained employed through December 31, 2010. Subject
to _Section 7.04(g)_ , Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) each such
Prorated Parent 2010 Bonus in a lump sum in cash no later than March 15,
2011. 

  

(f) _Schedule 7.04(f)_ sets forth the amount (up to $5,000,000) of a
retention pool for the purpose of retaining the services of key Company
Employees (the " _Retention Pool_ "), the Company Employees eligible to
receive retention awards from the Retention Pool and the amount each Company
Employee is eligible to receive (each a " _Retention Bonus_ "), the criteria
for payment of the Retention Bonuses, and the final allocation of payments
from the Retention Pool, which determination shall not be changed after the
Closing and shall only be changed prior to Closing as described in the next
sentence. Prior to the Closing but only prior to the time that the Retention
Bonuses are communicated to the Company Employees, the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company shall be entitled, subject to approval by the Board of
Managers of the Company, to reallocate among Company Employees (and subject
to the same criteria for payment) up to twenty percent (20%) of the Retention
Pool. Any Retention Bonus shall be intended to retain the services of the
recipient through, and shall be payable on, subject to _Section
7.04(g)_, the date (the " _Retention Payment Date_ ") that is the earlier of
(i) the one-year anniversary of the Closing and (ii) the date of such Company
Employees involuntary termination of employment after the Closing Date other
than for Cause or resignation for Good Reason after the Closing Date (whether
or not the Company Employee is listed on _Schedule 7.04(e))_; _provided_
that such Company Employee remains continuously employed in good standing by
the Company through such applicable payment date. Prior to the Closing, the
Company may adopt a plan and/or enter into award agreements with Company
Employees eligible to receive Retention Bonuses consistent with the terms of
this _Section 7.04(f)_ in such form approved by Parent (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld). Each Retention Bonus shall be intended to be
exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued
thereunder. 

  

(g) With respect to the portion of any Losses for which a Non-ECP Member is
determined to be liable in accordance with _ARTICLE XII_ , it is expressly
acknowledged and agreed that Parent may, but shall not be required to,
satisfy any such Losses in accordance with this _Section 7.04(g)_ by set-off
against or deduction from the Prorated Parent 2010 Bonus and/or
Retention Bonus that such Non-ECP Member would otherwise be eligible to
receive absent such Losses, but only to the extent that such determination
occurs prior to the Retention Payment Date or the Prorated Parent 2010 Bonus
payment date, as applicable. 

  

(h) Parent and the Company shall be entitled to withhold from any amounts
payable to Company Employees under this Agreement (including pursuant to
_Section 7.04(e)-(f)_) any federal, state, or local withholding or other
taxes or charges which the Company is required to withhold.

(i) Parent, Merger Sub, the ECP Members and the Company acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.04_ are included for the
sole benefit of the Parties, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
other arrangement, or shall create any third party beneficiary or other right
(i) in any other Person, including any Company Employee or any participant in
any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or other
arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), or (ii) to continued
employment with Parent, the ECP Members, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates. 

  

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this _Section
7.04_ shall inhibit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Entity to
terminate the employment of the Company Employees after the Closing Date,
with or without cause. 

  

7.05 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The ECP Members and the Company shall have the
right from time to time prior to the Closing Date to supplement or amend the
ECP Members Disclosure Schedule and the Companys Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered (but,
if such matter existed on the date hereof but was only discovered hereafter,
only to the extent such matter was not, to the knowledge of the ECP Members
or to the Knowledge of the Company, respectively, known as of the date
hereof) which if existing or known at the date of this Agreement would
have been required to be set forth or described in the ECP Members
Disclosure Schedule or the Companys Disclosure Schedule. Any such
supplemental or amended disclosure (each a " _Disclosure Supplement_ ") shall
be deemed to have cured any such breach of representation or warranty made in
this Agreement and to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for
purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
VIII_ have been satisfied, unless the item so disclosed would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and Parent is entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)_ and exercises such
right within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of such supplemented
or amended disclosure. 

  

7.06 _No Negotiations_. During the Interim Period, the ECP Members, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates and Representatives not to, initiate or solicit, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to,

or any agreement or commitment relating to, an Acquisition Proposal and shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to

furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance with any
provision of this _Section 7.07_ shall be subject to applicable rules
relating to discovery. 

  

7.08 _Release of Guaranties, etc._ With respect to each guaranty, letter of
credit, indemnity, performance or surety bond, agreement to provide capital
or other credit support arrangement issued by or for the account of any ECP

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE XII. 
 INDEMNIFICATION 

    

12.01 _Survival_. 

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive until the six-month anniversary of
the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 4.03_,  _4.12_ , _4.17(a)_ , _5.02_ ,

(b) This _ARTICLE XII_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect
(i) with respect to _Sections 12.02(a)(i)_ and _12.02(b)(i)_ , so long as
the relevant representations and warranties survive, and (ii) with respect to
_Sections 12.02(a)(ii)_ and  _12.02(b)(ii)_ , to the extent those sections
relate to the covenants requiring performance (A) prior to the Closing, such
covenants shall not survive the Closing (other than with respect to a knowing
or intentional breach of _Section 7.02_ in which case such section shall
survive until the six-month anniversary of the Closing) or (B) after the
Closing, such covenants shall survive until fully performed. 

  

(c) Notice of any assertion by any Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party is liable to it pursuant to _Section 12.02_ must be given to the
Indemnifying Party on or prior to the time of expiration of the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant as set forth in this  _Section 12.01_
or such claim will be forever barred. Any Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification hereunder shall state the facts known to the
asserting Indemnified Party that give rise to such notice in sufficient
detail to allow the Indemnifying Party to evaluate the assertion. 

   

12.02 _Indemnification._  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ , subsequent to
the Closing Date, the Members (severally, and not jointly, based on their Pro
Rata Share) shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent, any Affiliate of Parent
or their respective current or future officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, stockholders, controlling persons, successors and
permitted assigns against any liability, loss, reasonable attorneys fees,
suit, action or cause of action (collectively, " _Losses_ " and individually,
a " _Loss_ ") that any of the foregoing suffers as a result of: 

   

(i) any breach of the representations and warranties of the Company or such
Member set forth in this Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Member shall be liable for the breach by another Member
of any representation or warranty made by such other Member in _ARTICLE V_ or
any Letter of Transmittal (as applicable); or 

   

(ii) any breach or nonperformance by the Company or such Member of any of the
covenants or agreements of the Company or such Member set forth in this
Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Member shall be liable for the breach by another Member of any covenant or
agreement of such other Member in this Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal
(as applicable). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ , subsequent to
the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Member and
his, her or its estate, heirs, personal representatives, Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, partners, members, stockholders, controlling
persons, successors and permitted assigns against any Loss that any of the
foregoing suffers as a result of: 

   

(i) any breach of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement; or 

   

(ii) any breach or nonperformance by Parent and Merger Sub of any of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

   

12.03 _Third Party Claims._  

  

The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnifying Party with respect to
Losses resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (each, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions: 

  

(a) The Indemnified Parties shall promptly give written notice to the
Indemnifying Parties of any Third Party Claim that might give rise to any
Loss by the Indemnified Parties, stating the nature and basis of such Third
Party Claim, and the amount thereof to the extent known;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all
relevant documentation with respect to such Third Party Claim, including any
summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served, any written
demand or any other document or instrument. 

  

(b) From and after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 12.03(a)_ , the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to assume
and conduct, at their own expense, the defense against the Third Party Claim
in their own names or in the names of the Indemnified Parties. Any
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such Third Party Claim and/or to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be included as part of any Loss
incurred by the Indemnified Party and shall not be payable by the
Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall, based on advice of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, have conflicting or different claims or defenses, then the
Indemnifying Party shall not have control of such conflicting or differing
claims or defenses and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to appoint one
separate counsel for such claims and defenses, at the reasonable cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The party or parties conducting the
defense of any Third Party Claim shall keep the other parties apprised of all
significant developments with respect thereto and shall not enter into any
settlement, compromise or consent to judgment with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise or consent to a
judgment without the consent of the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third
Party Claim that only imposes monetary obligations that are paid by the
Indemnifying Party and contains a release of the Indemnified Party from all 

  

    ##### 

  

   

liability thereunder. The Indemnified Party shall make available all
information and assistance reasonably available and necessary for the defense
of the Third Party Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense. The
Member Representative shall be entitled to exercise any rights of the Members
with respect to Third Party Claims under this _Section 12.03_. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent determines in good faith that
there is a reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may have a
material adverse effect on it or the Surviving Entity, Parent may, by notice
to the Indemnifying Parties, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise
or settle such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Parties will not be
bound by any compromise or settlement effected without their consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If Parent should elect to exercise
such right, the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim at their
sole cost and expense. 

   

12.04 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

(a) As to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)_ or 
_12.02(b)_ (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification for a
breach of  _Section 7.09_), the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification (i) with respect to any Loss or a series of related Losses
for less than $25,000 and (ii) until all Losses to such Indemnified Party
exceed, in the aggregate, $3,000,000 (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ "), in
which case such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for all
such Losses;  _provided_ , _however_ , that that any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifier will not be taken into account in determining
the magnitude of the damages occasioned by the breach of any representation
or warranty for purposes of calculating the Indemnity Threshold (once a
breach of any representation or warranty has occurred after giving effect to
the applicable materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers). 

  

(b) In no event shall any Member in the aggregate be liable for any Losses as
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)_ in excess of
an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Base Purchase Price
distributed to it pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_, and __ in no event shall
Parent in the aggregate be liable for any Losses as to any claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.02(b)_ in excess of an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Base Purchase Price. 

  

(c) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the
Indemnifying Parties for any Losses arising under this Agreement or in
connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement any amount in excess of the actual compensatory damages, court
costs and reasonable attorneys fees suffered by such Party. Parent and the
Members on behalf of each of their respective Indemnified Parties waives any
right to recover incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages, including lost revenues or profits, even if such
damages are foreseeable or the damaged Party has advised the other Parties
of the possibility of such damages and regardless of whether any such damages
are deemed to result from the failure or inadequacy of any exclusive or other
remedy, unless such incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive,
consequential or other kind of special damages are awarded to a Person in an
indemnifiable Third Party Claim. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) The Members shall have no liability for any breach of this Agreement or
any certificate relating hereto delivered by the Members if the Members can
demonstrate that Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives had
actual knowledge of such breach or inaccuracy prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Members shall be liable, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ , for any such breach
arising out of information contained in a Disclosure Supplement. For purposes
of demonstrating Parents "actual knowledge" in accordance with the preceding
sentence, Parent shall be deemed to have "actual knowledge" of a breach or
inaccuracy if such breach or inaccuracy is reasonably apparent from
information provided in writing to Parent or any of its Representatives by
the Company, the Members or any of their Representatives prior to the date
hereof, including in the materials made available in the electronic data room
(excluding all attachments to any Phase I Environmental Assessment);
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of
the representation contained in  _Section 4.04(b)_ as to which the Members
must demonstrate Parents actual knowledge without relying on such
inference. 

  

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to
reimbursement for Losses in connection with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. 

  

(f) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this _ARTICLE XII_ to
indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to a Loss to the extent that the
Loss arose from or was exacerbated by any action taken by any Indemnified
Party on or after the Closing Date. 

  

(g) Any indemnifiable claim with respect to any breach or nonperformance by a
Party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be net of
any insurance proceeds received the Indemnified Party (net of any costs of
collection or other cost directly related to the insurance claim in respect
of Losses). If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any claim pursuant
to  _Section 12.02_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party
to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with
respect to such claim. 

  

12.05 _No Contribution_. No Indemnifying Party or any of its employees or
agents shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against the Company or Company Subsidiaries in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which she, he
or it may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement. 

  

12.06 _Remedies Exclusive_. The indemnification rights of the Parties under
this  _ARTICLE XII_ are the exclusive remedies after the Closing available to
the Surviving Entity, the Members and Parent with respect to any claims or
disputes arising between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Business or the Properties other than
claims involving fraud, with respect to which the Parties rights and remedies
shall not be affected or diminished hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained herein shall affect the rights of the Parties under
_Section 13.13_ with respect to any covenants to be performed after the
Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

12.07 _Non-Recourse_. Except as expressly set forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ ,
no Party shall have recourse whatsoever under this Agreement against any of
the Representatives of the other Parties (including for such purposes, the
Representatives of any Affiliate of a Party). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this _ARTICLE XII_ ,
Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and the Members, on behalf of
themselves and their Affiliates, each hereby fully and irrevocably waives any
right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against such Representatives relating
to any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them arising from,
based upon, related to, or associated with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any
breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions) in each case
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability other laws or otherwise and
whether by piercing of the corporate veil, by claim on behalf of or by a
Party hereto or other Person or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 12.07_ shall limit the right of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to bring a claim against any employee of the Company
for a breach of the LLC Agreement or a breach of his or her employment
Contract with the Company. 

  

ARTICLE XIII. 
 MISCELLANEOUS

13.03 _Confidentiality_. Unless and until the Closing occurs, the Parties will

use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates and
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any other Person all
information and documents relating to the Projects and the Company,
_provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall limit the disclosure by any
Party of any information (a) to the extent required by Applicable Law or
judicial process ( _provided_ that if permitted by Applicable Law, each Party
agrees to give the other Parties prior notice of such disclosure in sufficient
time to permit such other Parties to obtain a protective order should they so
determine), (b) in connection with any litigation among the Parties (
_provided_ that such Party has taken all reasonable actions to limit the
scope and degree of disclosure in any such litigation), (c) in an Action
brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its
remedies under this Agreement, (d) to the extent that such documents or
information can be shown to have come within the public domain through no

Affiliates (but the Party shall be liable for any breach by its Affiliates).
In the event this Agreement is terminated under _Section 11.01_, upon the
request of any Party, the other Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates

with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

13.05 _No Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise and no
delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right,
remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of
such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of any such right, remedy, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in this Agreement are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided by Applicable Law.

modified, supplemented or waived only by an instrument in writing duly
executed by each Party. Any such amendment, modification, supplement or
waiver shall be for such period and subject to such conditions as shall be

the Parties, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purposes for which given.

Agreement are included solely for convenience of reference and are not
intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

13.09 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction, and in lieu
of such prohibited or unenforceable provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such prohibited or unenforceable
provision as may be possible. 

  

13.10 _Assignment_. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement are not assignable without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, which such Parties may withhold in their discretion; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have the right to assign its rights and

13.12 _Disclosure_. The ECP Members and the Company may, at their option,
include in the ECP Members Disclosure Schedules and the Companys Disclosure
Schedules, respectively, any items that are not material in order to avoid
any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation
that such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to
define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.
Information disclosed in any Schedule shall constitute a disclosure for
purposes of all other Schedules notwithstanding the lack of specific cross-
reference thereto, but only to the extent the applicability of such disclosure
to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent. In no event shall the
inclusion of any matter in the Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden
the ECP Members or the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the
ECP Members Disclosure Schedules or Companys Disclosure Schedules shall not
be deemed an admission by the ECP Members or the Company that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event, or circumstance or that such
item would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

13.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, money damages may
not be a sufficient remedy and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate injunctive relief,
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy,
in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. 

  

13.14 _Governing Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO

arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, each Party submits to the
personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal
courts of the United States sitting in New York County, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that any such Action may be heard and determined
in such New York court or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in
such federal court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such
Action may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that any Party may otherwise have to bring any Action
relating to this Agreement against the other Parties or their Properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction. 

  

(b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so: 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(i) any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any New York state or federal court located in New York County; and 

   

(ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in
any such court. 

  

(c) Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process by registered mail,
return receipt requested, as provided in _Section 13.07_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
