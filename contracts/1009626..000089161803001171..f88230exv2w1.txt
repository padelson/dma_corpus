ARTICLE IX hereof only, Douglas M. Leone as stockholder representative
(the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE"), and U.S. Bank, N.A. as escrow agent (the

Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (i) all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company
shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth
herein, and (ii) all issued and outstanding options to purchase capital stock
of the Company shall be assumed by Parent and converted into options to
purchase common stock of Parent.   C. A portion of the consideration
otherwise payable by Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in
escrow by Parent as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in
this Agreement.   D. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on
the other hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements in connection with the Merger.   E. Concurrent with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material inducement to

directors of the Company and certain principal stockholders of the Company
are entering into Voting Agreements, in form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A
(the "VOTING AGREEMENTS"), with Parent, (ii) Key Employees (as defined in

(iii) the Key Employees are accepting offers of employment from
Parent effective as of the Effective Time.   F. The parties intend, by
executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "CODE").     EXECUTION COPY   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of

event  of a discrepancy between the provisions of subparagraphs (i), (ii) and

parties hereto that the provisions of the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation shall control; provided however that the discount from market
value attributable to restrictions on free marketability specified in SECTION
3(c)(III)(B) of the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation shall be deemed
to be zero; and provided further that for the purposes of determining the
allocation of the Merger Consideration, shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of Company Options and Company Assumed Warrants
shall be deemed outstanding.   (v) The shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received in connection with the Merger or to be received upon exercise of
vested or unvested Company Options assumed in connection with the Merger
shall be restricted such that each Stockholder may not: (i) offer, pledge,
sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale
of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received in connection with the Merger or to be received upon exercise of
vested or unvested Company Options assumed in connection with the Merger or
(ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that
transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic
consequence of ownership of the Parent Common Stock to be received in
connection with the Merger or to be received upon exercise of vested or
unvested Company Options assumed in connection with the Merger, whether any
such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Parent Common Stock
or other securities, in cash or otherwise (collectively, the "LOCK-UP
PROVISION"). The Lock-up Provision shall lapse as follows: (A) a number of
shares equal to forty five percent (45%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be received by each Stockholder (including for the purpose of calculating
the percentages in this sentence all shares subject to assumed Company
Options, whether vested or unvested, and the aggregate number of additional
shares that may be issued upon payment in full of the Earn-Out Payment) shall
be freely tradeable and transferable upon the Closing, to the extent vested
or, if forty five percent (45%) of such shares are not vested, up to forty
five percent (45%) of such shares upon vesting), (B) a number of shares equal
to thirty percent (30%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received
by each Stockholder shall be freely tradeable and transferable on the date
that is six (6) months after the Closing, to the extent vested or, if thirty
percent (30%) of such shares are not vested, up to thirty   -8-    
EXECUTION COPY  percent (30%) of such shares upon vesting), and (C) the
remaining twenty five percent (25%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be received by such Stockholder (including shares released from the escrow

freely tradeable and transferable on the first anniversary of the Closing.
Certificates that represent shares of Parent Common Stock to be received in
connection with the Merger or issued upon exercise of vested or unvested
Company Options assumed in connection with the Merger shall be legended to
reflect the Lock-up Provision (the "LOCK-UP LEGEND").   (vi) For purposes
of calculating the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each
Stockholder pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(b), the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to each Stockholder shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and no cash will be
paid for fractional shares; provided, however, that the maximum number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger shall not
exceed the Total Adjusted Consideration.   (c) EARN-OUT PAYMENT.   (i)
Amount of Earn-Out Payment. As additional Merger Consideration, Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent (as defined in SECTION 1.8), on behalf
of and for distribution to the persons, in the amounts and in the manner to
be set forth on SCHEDULE 1.6(c) (the "EARN-OUT PAYEES"), an aggregate amount
of 2,925,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "EARN-OUT PAYMENT"). The
Company shall deliver SCHEDULE 1.6(c) at the same time that it delivers the
Spreadsheet (as defined in SECTION 5.22). Parent shall make the Earn-Out
Payment available to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of and for distribution to
the Earn-Out Payees, as soon as practicable following the date on which it is
determined, in the manner provided below, that the conditions for payment of
the Earn-Out Payment set forth on ANNEX A have been satisfied (the "EARN-OUT
PAYMENT DATE").   (ii) Determination of Earn-Out Payment;
Dispute Resolution. At any time at which Parent or the Stockholder
Representative believes in good faith that the conditions for payment of the
Earn-Out Payment have been satisfied, Parent or the Stockholder
Representative (the "NOTIFIER"), shall deliver to the other party (the
"RECIPIENT"), as soon as practicable, a written statement that summarizes
such party\'s belief, and the basis therefor (the "CONDITION SATISFACTION
NOTICE"). The Notifier\'s determination under this SECTION 1.6(c) of whether
and when the conditions for payment of the Earn-Out Payment were satisfied
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto unless, within ten
(10) days following receipt by the Recipient of the Condition Satisfaction
Notice, the Recipient notifies the Notifier in writing that the Recipient
disagrees with the Notifier\'s determination. Such notice shall include a
summary of the reasons why the Recipient disagrees with the
Notifier\'s determination together with a copy of any information, other than
that previously provided by the Notifier, used in making such
determination.   If the Notifier disagrees with the Recipient\'s
determination, Parent\'s Chief Financial Officer, or his designee, shall
promptly meet with the Stockholder Representative, or his designee, and the
parties shall attempt in good faith to reach a resolution of such
disagreement. If such disagreement   -9-     EXECUTION COPY  is not
resolved within five (5) days after delivery of the Recipient\'s notice, then
the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with SECTIONS 7.3(h)(ii),
(iii) AND (iv). Parent shall not be required to make the Earn-Out Payment, or
any portion thereof, to the Exchange Agent until the period during which
the Stockholder Representative may object to the amount of an Earn-Out
Payment has lapsed or, if properly contested in accordance with the
provisions hereof, the amount and timing of the Earn-Out Payment has been
agreed upon by the parties or resolved in accordance with Sections
7.3(h)(ii), (iii) and (iv).   (iii) Rights Not Transferable. The rights
of Earn-Out Payees to the Earn-Out Payment are personal to each Earn-Out
Payee and shall not be transferable for any reason other than by operation of
law, will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted transfer of
such right by any holder thereof (other than as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence) shall be null and void.   (iv) Method of Payment. The
portion of the Earn-Out Payment that is not subject to any contingencies
shall be made available by Parent to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of and for
the account of the Earn-Out Payees, and shall be issued by the Exchange Agent
to the address of the Earn-Out Payees provided to the Exchange Agent by the
Stockholder Representative, after taking such action as is necessary to
assure that all applicable federal or state income withholding and any other
taxes are withheld and deducted from such funds otherwise to be paid. The
portion of the Earn-Out Payment that is subject to contingencies shall be
made available by Parent to the Exchange Agent, on behalf of and for the
account of the Earn-Out Payees, in installments upon the satisfaction of all
applicable contingencies. The Earn-Out Payment shall be subject to a right of
set-off as set forth in SECTION 7.6 below.   (d) ASSUMPTION OF COMPANY
OPTIONS; TREATMENT OF COMPANY  WARRANTS.   (i) As soon as practicable

assumed by Parent pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(d) shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set
forth in the applicable Plan and the option agreements relating thereto, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) such
assumed Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
(B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such assumed Company Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, and (C) each holder of Company Options shall have waived and
amended all rights regarding any acceleration of vesting including, without
limitation, acceleration upon a change of control, termination without cause,
or constructive termination or similar provision contained in  
-10-     EXECUTION COPY  any agreement relating to Company Options, by
execution of the Waiver of Vesting; provided, however, that in the case of
any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price of the
option, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order
to comply with Section 424 of the Code.   (ii) At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Assumed Warrant shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company
Assumed Warrant so assumed by Parent pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(d) shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms) set forth in such warrant agreements relating thereto, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) such Company
Assumed Warrant will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Stock that would have
been received by the holder of such Company Assumed Warrant pursuant to
SECTION 1.6(b) if such Company Assumed Warrant had been exercised in its
entirety prior to the Effective Time, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Common Stock; (B) the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Assumed
Warrant shall be equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Assumed Warrant as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (C)
the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Assumed
Warrant shall be marked with the Lock-up Legend and subject to the Lock-up
Provision as set forth in SECTION 1.6(b)(V).   (iii) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to effect the transactions
anticipated by this SECTION 1.6(d) under all Company Option agreements, all
agreements related to Company Unvested Common Stock, all Company Assumed
Warrant agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company (whether
written or oral, formal or informal).   (e) ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT. As soon
as administratively practicable following the Closing, Parent shall issue to
each holder of a Company Option to be assumed by Parent pursuant to SECTION
1.6(d) hereof a document evidencing the assumption of such Company Option, by
Parent, and each former holder of a Company Option so assumed by Parent shall
acknowledge the receipt of the same in exchange for such holder\'s Company
Option.   (f) WITHHOLDING TAXES. Any number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to a Stockholder pursuant to SECTION 1.6(b) or SECTION
1.6(c) hereof shall be subject to, and reduced by, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock with an aggregate value, based on the Trading Price,
equal to the required amount of any state, federal and foreign withholding
taxes incurred (and not previously paid by or on behalf of such Stockholder
or the Company) in connection with the acquisition of Company Capital Stock
upon the exercise of Company Options, upon the lapsing of repurchase rights
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock, or upon payment of a bonus in
the form of Company Common Stock, if any, to such Stockholder rounded to the
nearest whole share (with amounts greater than 0.5 shares rounded up).  
-11-     EXECUTION COPY   (g) STOCKHOLDER LOANS. In the event that any
Stockholder has outstanding loans from the Company as of the Effective Time,
such loans may be subject to repayment through the reduction of the
consideration otherwise payable to such Stockholder pursuant to this SECTION
1.6 pursuant to a separate written agreement between Parent and such
Stockholder.   (h) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each share of Common Stock of
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (i) SHARES SUBJECT TO VESTING. If any shares of
Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable stock restriction
agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Capital Stock
shall also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition (including any requirement that any unvested
shares be held in escrow), and the certificate representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends in the
discretion of Parent, except that certain holders of Company Unvested Common
Stock have waived and amended all rights regarding acceleration or lapsing of
repurchase rights upon a change of control, termination without cause or
constructive termination, to the extent such provisions exist, by entering
into a Waiver of Vesting.   1.7 DISSENTING SHARES   (a) Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company
Capital Stock held by a holder who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law or the Corporations Code of the
State of California ("CALIFORNIA LAW"), as applicable ("DISSENTING SHARES")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in SECTION 1.6 hereof, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by
Delaware Law or California Law, as applicable.   (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of SECTION 1.7(a) hereof, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder\'s appraisal rights under Delaware Law or California Law, as
applicable, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock, as applicable, set forth in SECTION 1.6 hereof, without interest
thereon, and subject to the provisions of SECTION 7.3 hereof, upon surrender
of the certificate representing such shares.   -12-     EXECUTION

demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law or California Law, as applicable, and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer
to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in
respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that
otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance
with this Agreement or (ii) incurs any other costs or expenses, (including
specifically, but without limitation, attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses in
connection with any action or proceeding or in connection with any
investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for
such shares) (together "DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"), Parent shall be entitled
to recover under the terms of ARTICLE VII hereof the amount of such
Dissenting Share Payments without regard to the Threshold Amount (as defined
in SECTION 7.3(b) hereof).   1.8 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES   (a) EXCHANGE
AGENT. The Secretary of Parent, or an institution selected by Parent, shall
serve as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the Merger.   (b)
PARENT TO PROVIDE PARENT COMMON STOCK. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this ARTICLE I the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
SECTION 1.6 hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital

deposit into the Escrow Fund (as defined in SECTION 7.3(a) hereof) a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (not including any Company Unvested Common
Stock equal to the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Stockholders pursuant to
SECTION 1.6 hereof. Each Stockholder shall be deemed to have contributed his
or her Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow
Fund, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.
If the sum of the Pro Rata Portions (each rounded to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock) for all Stockholders does not equal the
Escrow Amount, then the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
will be added to or subtracted from the Pro Rata Portion of Sequoia Capital X
such that the sum of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the Escrow
Amount.   (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall mail a letter of transmittal in such form and having
such provisions as Parent may reasonably request to each Stockholder at the
address set forth opposite each such Stockholder\'s name on the Spreadsheet
(as defined in SECTION 5.22 hereof). After receipt of such letter of
transmittal, the Stockholders will surrender the certificates representing
their shares of Company Capital Stock (the "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES") to
the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate for cancellation to the   -13-     EXECUTION
COPY  Exchange Agent, or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, subject to the terms of
SECTION 1.8(e) hereof, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange therefor, a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the
Escrow Fund on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to SECTION 1.8(b) hereof and
ARTICLE VII hereof) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to SECTION
1.6(b) hereof in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate, and the Company
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered,
each Company Stock Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be
deemed from and for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to
receive the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted.   (d)
DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any
such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.   (e) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the
certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid
to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) NO
LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 1.8,
neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   1.9 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY CAPITAL
STOCK   The shares of Parent Common Stock paid in respect of the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no   -14-    
EXECUTION COPY  further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
ARTICLE I.   1.10 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES   In the event
any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to SECTION 1.6
hereof; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Stockholder who
is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i)
deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct or (ii) provide
an indemnification agreement in a form and substance acceptable to Parent,
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.11 TAX CONSEQUENCES   It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.   1.12 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER

assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
Parent, Sub, and the officers and directors of the Company, Parent and Sub
are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions of this SECTION 4.2 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction
or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other
security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this SECTION 4.2 and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent, representative
or affiliate of Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Company.   ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   5.1 FAIRNESS HEARING;
STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare the
necessary documents to apply to obtain, and Parent shall apply to obtain, a
permit (a "CALIFORNIA PERMIT") from the California Commissioner of
Corporations (after a hearing before such Commissioner) pursuant to Sections
25121 and 25142 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (the
"FAIRNESS HEARING LAW"), so that (i) the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger, and (ii) the assumption of Company Options, shall be exempt from
registration under the Securities Act, by virtue of the exemption provided by
Section 3(a)(10) thereof, and the Company shall prepare, with the cooperation
of Parent, a related information statement or other disclosure document (the
"INFORMATION STATEMENT"). The Information Statement shall constitute a
disclosure document for the offer and issuance of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger.
The Company shall cooperate with, and provide information to, Parent in
connection with Parent\'s application for the California Permit. Company and
Parent will respond to any comments from the California Department of
Corporations and work together in good faith to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to have the California Permit granted as soon as
practicable after such filing. Each of Parent and the Company agrees
to provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business
and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate under the
Fairness Hearing Law for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any
amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to
cooperate with the other\'s counsel and auditors in preparation of the
Information Statement. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the Information Statement
any information with respect to Parent or its affiliates or   -50-    
EXECUTION COPY  associates, the form and content of which shall not have
been approved by Parent prior to such inclusion, except as required pursuant
to the Fairness Hearing Law or other applicable law. As promptly as practical
after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Company shall prepare and make
such filings as are required of them under applicable blue sky laws relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company shall use
reasonable and good faith efforts to assist Parent as may be necessary to
comply with the securities and blue sky laws relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company Assumed Warrants which are not
exercised for Company Capital Stock prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into warrants to purchase Parent Common Stock which shall be
restricted securities.   (b) If the California Commissioner of Corporations
denies the California Permit (after Parent has exhausted all opportunities of
appeal) provided that the Company and the signatories to the Voting
Agreements have cooperated in good faith to obtain the California Permit,
Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") with respect to the Total Consideration.
Company and Parent will respond to any comments of the SEC, and Parent will
use its reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent shall determine pursuant to
the good faith judgment of its Chief Executive Officer, or alternatively, the
Board of Directors of Parent, that it would be significantly harmful to
Parent and its stockholders to file the Registration Statement (or an
amendment thereto), due to the existence of a material development or
potential material development with respect to or involving Parent which
Parent would be obligated to disclose in the Prospectus contained in the
Registration Statement, which disclosure would in the good faith judgment of
the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of Parent be premature
or otherwise inadvisable at such time and would not be in the best interests
Parent and its stockholders, then Parent shall notify the Company in writing
to the effect of the foregoing, and Parent will not be required to file the
Registration Statement or amendment thereto until the earlier of (1) 90 days
after the denial of the Permit and (2) as soon, in the judgment of Parent, as
disclosure of the material information relating to such pending development
would not have a adverse effect on Parent\'s ability to consummate the
transaction, if any, to which such development relates.   (c) As promptly as
practicable after the receipt of a California Permit or following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company shall submit this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Stockholders for
approval and adoption as provided by Delaware Law and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company. Such submission, and any proxy or
consent in connection therewith, shall specify that adoption of this
Agreement shall constitute approval by the Stockholders of: (i) the
escrow and indemnification obligations of the Stockholders set forth in
ARTICLE VII hereof and the deposit of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Amount into the Escrow Fund, (ii) the Lock-up Provision, and (iii) in favor
of the appointment of Douglas M. Leone as Stockholder Representative, under
and as defined in this Agreement. Any materials to be submitted to the
Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their approval of the
Merger and this Agreement (the "SOLICITING MATERIALS") shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent and shall include information regarding the
Company, the terms of   -51-     EXECUTION COPY  the Merger and this
Agreement, and the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company in favor of the Merger and this Agreement and conversion of Company
Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock. Anything to the contrary contained
herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the Soliciting
Materials any information with respect to Parent or its affiliates
or associates, the form and content of which shall not have been approved by
Parent prior to such inclusion. The Company shall consult with Parent
regarding the date of the Company Stockholders\' meeting or the date of the
solicitation of stockholder approval by written consent to approve this
Agreement and the Merger (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING/SOLICITATION")
and shall not postpone or adjourn (other than for absence of a quorum) the
Company Stockholder Meeting/Solicitation without the consent of the Parent.
The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the consent of its
Stockholders sufficient to approve the Merger and this Agreement and to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof and, in any event, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of
the California Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall give
Stockholders sufficient notice such that no Stockholder will be able to
exercise appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law if such
Stockholder has not perfected such appraisal rights prior to Closing.   5.2
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER   All certificates representing Parent Common Stock
deliverable to any Stockholder of the Company pursuant to this Agreement and
in connection with the Merger and any certificates subsequently issued with
respect thereto or in substitution therefor (including any shares issued or
issuable in respect of any such shares upon any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, or similar event) shall bear the Lock-up Legend (as defined
in section 1.6(b)) as well as any legend required by the California
Commissioner of Corporations or such as are required pursuant to any federal,
state, local or foreign law governing such securities.   5.3 ACCESS TO
INFORMATION   The Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives, reasonable access during the period from the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records of the Company, including the Company\'s
source code, (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties
and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the
Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees of the
Company as identified by Parent. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal
financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation)
promptly upon request. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this SECTION 5.3 or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.   5.4 CONFIDENTIALITY  
-52-     EXECUTION COPY   Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that
the information obtained in any investigation pursuant to SECTION 5.3 hereof,
or pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement effective as of October 14, 2002
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") between the Company and Parent. In this
regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly
traded and that any information obtained during the course of its due
diligence could be considered to be material non-public information within
the meaning of federal and state securities laws. In addition, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Company\'s

all rights of, and benefits to, the Company under such Contract from and
after the Effective Time. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in
a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. Notwithstanding the terms of SECTION
5.5 above, in the event that the other parties to any such Contract,

and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to
remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in
order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits

required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of
Parent\'s subsidiaries   -54-     EXECUTION COPY  or affiliates, of

to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock. In addition, the Company shall use commercially

no defaults thereunder.   5.10 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS   Each
party shall give prompt notice (in any event within 24 hours) to the other
parties of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event known to such
party, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) any
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this SECTION 5.10 shall
not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this
SECTION 5.10, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or
breach of covenant.   5.11 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES

deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of

position and salary, which will be determined by Parent, and (iv) supersede
any prior express or implied employment agreements, arrangement or offer
letter in effect prior to the Closing Date. At the same time as the execution
of this Agreement, each Key Employee has executed an Offer Letter. Each
employee of the Company who remains an employee of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date shall be referred to hereafter
as a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE." Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
receive benefits consistent with Parent\'s applicable human resources
policies. Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation or appropriate
subsidiary of Parent to give Continuing Employees full credit under such
policies for prior service at the Company for purposes of eligibility,
benefit accrual, and determination of the level of benefits under Parent\'s
benefit plans, programs or policies, provided that such credit does not
result in duplication of benefits. In furtherance of the foregoing, and at
Parent\'s request the Company shall terminate all employment agreements and
other arrangements with its employees effective as of the Closing Date.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Continuing
Employees the opportunity to enroll in a special offering period under the

Parent.   5.15 VESTING WAIVERS   Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each individual listed in SCHEDULE 5.15 has entered into a vesting
waiver with Parent in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT D.   5.16

The Company shall provide Parent such information and documents as Parent
shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Parent and Sub
shall be entitled to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for Parent Common Stock and to place the following legend on
the certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by such
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:   "THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE
145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE   -56-     EXECUTION COPY   TRANSFERRED IN
CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(d) OR PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR  IN ACCORDANCE
WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE  TO THE ISSUER IN
FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM  REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."   The legend set forth above shall be
removed (by delivery of a substitute certificate without such legend) and
Parent shall so instruct its transfer agent, if Affiliate delivers to Parent
(i) satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in
compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate shall be

and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that public
sale of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule
145.   5.17 STATEMENT OF EXPENSES   The Company shall provide Parent with

Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) PLAN") (unless Parent provides
written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be
terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have
been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or
such Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company
Employee Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no
later than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.   5.19

From and after the Effective Time (but subject to SECTION 7.1 hereof), the
Stockholders agree to indemnify and hold Parent and its officers,
directors, and affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses of investigation and defense and diminution in value
(hereinafter individually a "LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES") discovered by
an Indemnified Party on or prior to the Survival Date that was incurred or
sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving
Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any
covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Dissenting
Share Payments, or (iv) any Excess Third Party Expenses. The Stockholders
shall not have any right of contribution from the Surviving Corporation or
Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by an Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, or in any agreement between the
Company and any Company Stockholder to the contrary entered into prior to the
Closing, in no event shall the Surviving Corporation, as the successor in
interest to the Company by virtue of the Merger, be obligated to reimburse,
contribute, indemnify or hold harmless any   -66-     EXECUTION
COPY  Company Stockholder for or in connection with any Losses or
obligations of the Company Stockholder under this ARTICLE VII, whether or not
such person would otherwise be entitled to payment pursuant to SECTION 5.31
hereof.   7.3 ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS   (a) ESCROW FUND. By virtue of this
Agreement and as security for the indemnity obligations provided for in
SECTION 7.2 hereof, at the Effective Time, the Stockholders will be deemed to
have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount (plus any
New Shares as defined in SECTION 7.3(e)(II) hereof) without any act of the
Stockholders. The Escrow Amount shall be available to compensate the
Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this
ARTICLE VII. Promptly after the Closing, the Escrow Amount, without any act
of the Stockholders, will be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit of
the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") to be
governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Fund shall be funded
exclusively with shares of Parent Common Stock that are not unvested or
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable stock restriction agreement or other agreement. The Escrow
Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the date
hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date
hereof between the other signatories hereto.   (b) THRESHOLD AMOUNT.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as
set forth in the second sentence of this SECTION 7.3(b), an Indemnified Party
may not recover any Losses under SECTION 7.2 unless and until one or more
Officer\'s Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under
SECTION 7.2 in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT")
has or have been delivered to the Escrow Agent or the Stockholder
Representative (as defined IN SECTION 7.4 hereof) as provided in SECTION
7.3(f) hereof, in which case Parent shall be entitled to recover all Losses
so identified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled
to recover for, and the Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to,
any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) Losses resulting from
any breach of representation or warranty contained in SECTION 2.2 (Company
Capital Structure) or in SECTION 2.10 (Tax Matters) hereof, (B) any
Dissenting Share Payments, (C) any Excess Third Party Expenses, and (D)
Losses resulting from the failure of any Stockholder to pay Agent
Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses
(vi) and (vii) of SECTION 7.3(j) hereof or Independent Accounting Firm
Expenses pursuant to SECTION 5.5 hereof. Losses not subject to the Threshold
Amount shall not be included in determining whether the Threshold amount has
been exceeded. For the purposes hereof, "OFFICER\'S CERTIFICATE" shall mean a
certificate signed by any officer of Parent in good faith: (1) stating that
an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue
Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each   -67-    
EXECUTION COPY  such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related.   (c) ESCROW SOLE REMEDY. Except to the extent that the
Losses resulted from fraud or any knowing and intentional breaches of
covenants committed by the Company, claims by an Indemnified Party for Losses
shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund.   (d) ESCROW PERIOD;
DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF ESCROW PERIODS. Subject to the following
requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the
Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time at Parent\'s
headquarters, on the date thirty (30) days after the Survival Date (the
"ESCROW PERIOD") and the shares held in Escrow shall be delivered to
Stockholders promptly thereafter; provided, however, that the Escrow Period
shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the good faith
judgment of Parent, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified
in any Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and
the Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination date
with respect Losses arising prior to the Survival Date. As soon as each such
claim has been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion
of the Escrow Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such claim or any
remaining claim. Deliveries of the Escrow Amount out of the Escrow Fund to
the Stockholders pursuant to this SECTION 7.3(d) shall be made in proportion
to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining shares in the Escrow
Fund, with the amount delivered to each Stockholder rounded to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. If the sum of the Pro Rata
Portions (each rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock) does not equal the remaining shares in the Escrow Fund, then the
appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock will be added to or
subtracted from the Pro Rata Portion of Sequoia Capital X such that the sum
of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the remaining shares in the
Escrow Fund.   (e) PROTECTION OF ESCROW FUND.   (i) The Escrow Agent shall
hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such
fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not
as the property of Parent and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only
in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE VII.   (ii) Any shares of
Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or distributed by
Parent after the Effective Time (including shares issued upon a stock split)
("NEW SHARES") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which
have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund
and become a part thereof. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added
to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof.
Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund
but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof.   -68-    
EXECUTION COPY   (iii) Each of the Stockholders shall have voting rights
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to and held in
the Escrow Fund by such Stockholder (and on any voting securities added
to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).   (f)
CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION.   (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any
time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of an Officer\'s
Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of SECTION
7.3(g) and SECTION 7.3(h) hereof, deliver to Parent, as promptly as
practicable, Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund equal to such Losses
(as calculated based on the Trading Price).   (ii) Failure by the
Stockholder Representative to object in writing within the 30-day period
after delivery by the Parent of the Officer\'s Certificate shall be an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholders that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the
claim for Losses set forth in such Officer\'s Certificate.   (g) OBJECTIONS
TO CLAIMS AGAINST THE ESCROW FUND. At the time of delivery of any Officer\'s
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall
be delivered to the Stockholder Representative, and for a period of thirty
(30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to
Parent of any Escrow Amount pursuant to SECTION 7.3(f) (other than Agreed-
Upon Losses as described below) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make
such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, subject
to the limitations set forth in SECTION 7.3(f)(i), the Escrow Agent shall
make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund equal to
the amount of Losses claimed in the Officer\'s Certificate, provided that no
such payment or delivery may be made if the Stockholder Representative, shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate
(an "OBJECTION NOTICE"), and such Objection Notice shall have been delivered
to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative hereby waives
the right to object to any claims against the Escrow Fund in respect of any
Agreed-Upon Loss (as defined in SECTION 7.3(h)(v) hereof). The Stockholder
Representative hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver shares of Parent
Common Stock from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of Losses claimed in
any Officer\'s Certificate in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss upon receipt of
such Officer\'s Certificate without regard to the thirty (30) day period set
forth in this SECTION 7.3(g).   (h) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS;
ARBITRATION.   (i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers an
Objection Notice in accordance with SECTION 7.3(g) (other than Agreed-Upon
Losses as defined in SECTION 7.3(h)(v) hereof), the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and  
-69-     EXECUTION COPY  signed by both parties and shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof.   (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation and prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Objection
Notice, either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not
be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If either Parent or
the Stockholder Representative fails to select an arbitrator during this
fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be
conducted by one arbitrator selected by the party not so failing to select an
arbitrator.   (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara
County, California, under the rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all
expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid, including without
limitation, the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each
arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys\' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of
any claim in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be final, binding,
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be
written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such
award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a
decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such
party shall make the payment to such other party.   (iv) Judgment upon any
award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute
among   -70-     EXECUTION COPY  the Stockholders and the Indemnified
Party under this ARTICLE VII hereof, whether relating to claims upon the
Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations set forth in this
ARTICLE VII.   (v) This SECTION 7.3(h) shall not apply to claims against
the Escrow Fund made in respect of (A) any Dissenting Share Payments (as
defined in SECTION 1.7(c)), (B) any Excess Third Party Expenses (as defined
in SECTION 5.5) and (C) any Agent Interpleader Expenses or
Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses (vi) and (vii) of SECTION
7.3(j) hereof (each of (A), (B) and (C), an "AGREED-UPON LOSS"). Claims
against the Escrow Fund made in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be
resolved in the manner described in SECTION 7.3(g) above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within thirty (30) days after the payment of any such
claim, the Stockholder Representative may challenge the appropriateness of
such claim by delivering an Objection Notice as described above, in which
case the procedures set forth in this SECTION 7.3(h) shall apply to the
resolution of such challenge.   (i) THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. In the event Parent
becomes aware of a third party claim (other than a claim that is the subject
of an Agreed-Upon Loss) (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") which Parent reasonably
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, Parent shall notify the
Stockholder Representative of such claim, and the Stockholder Representative
shall be entitled on behalf of the Stockholders, at its expense, to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third
Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct
the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided, however, that except
with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such
Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the
amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders shall
have no power or authority to object under any provision of this ARTICLE VII
to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with
respect to such settlement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, this SECTION 7.3(i) shall not apply to any third party claim that
is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss. Claims against the Escrow Fund made in
respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in
SECTION 7.3(h)(v) above.   (j) ESCROW AGENT\'S DUTIES.   (i) The Escrow
Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are
specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this
Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining
from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall
be conclusive evidence of such good faith.   -71-     EXECUTION
COPY   (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard
any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other
person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby
expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of
any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any
of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such
compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to
have been entered without jurisdiction.   (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of
the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this
Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.  
(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   (v) In performing any duties
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for
damages, losses, or expenses, except for negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such
liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or
(B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including
any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the
Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow
Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or
determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the
Escrow Agent\'s duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in
any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance
with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for
determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to
act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.   (vi) If any controversy
arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party,
concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the
Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any
action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow
Amount and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final
appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent\'s
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages.
Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the
clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in
escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "AGENT
INTERPLEADER EXPENSES") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: fifty
percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the
Stockholders on the basis of the   -72-     EXECUTION
COPY  Stockholders\' respective Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that
in the event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion
of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader
Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such
action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.  
(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable
costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house
counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this
Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out
of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the
"AGENT INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid
by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis
of the Stockholders\' Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that in the event
any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the
Agent Indemnification Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification
Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund; and provided further,
that in no event shall any Stockholder\'s liability pursuant to this
paragraph exceed amounts actually received by it pursuant to the Merger.  
(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty
(30) days written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative;
provided, however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best
efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days
after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor
escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State
of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an
instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the
predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon
appointment of a successor escrow agent and delivery to such successor all
documents and Escrow Amounts held hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.  
(k) FEES. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard
fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any   -73-     EXECUTION COPY  service not
provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of
Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of
the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a
party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or
its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for
such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by
such default, delay, controversy or litigation.   (l) SUCCESSOR ESCROW
AGENTS. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any
corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the
Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.   7.4
STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE   (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and
this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, with respect to the
Escrow and SECTION 1.6(c) each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have
agreed to appoint Douglas M. Leone as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the
Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified
Party from the Escrow in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to
agree or disagree with the determination of the Earn-Out Payment, to object

awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims or disputes related to the
Earn-Out Payment, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified
Party pursuant to the Escrow or SECTION 1.8(c), in each case relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of
the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled
by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholder Representative, and the
Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its
services. With respect to the Escrow or SECTION 1.8(c), notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Stockholders.   (b) The Stockholder Representative
shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable   -74-     EXECUTION COPY  judgment. The Stockholders on
whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall
indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholder Representative ("STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE
EXPENSES"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative with respect to SECTION 1.6(c) or the Escrow, including but
not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant
to SECTION 7.3 and SECTION 7.4 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders. The
Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative.   7.5 MAXIMUM PAYMENTS;
REMEDY   (a) Except as set forth in SECTION 7.5(b) and SECTION
7.5(c) hereof, the maximum amount an Indemnified Party may recover from a
Stockholder individually pursuant to the indemnity set forth in SECTION 7.2
hereof for Losses shall be limited to a number of shares equal to such
Stockholder\'s Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability of any Stockholder (and the Escrow Fund
shall not be the exclusive remedy) in respect of Losses arising out of any
fraud committed by such Stockholder or any knowing and intentional breaches
of covenants on the part of such Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Stockholder shall not be liable for any amount in excess of its Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Fund for any fraud committed by another Stockholder or
any knowing and intentional breaches of covenants on the part of another
Stockholder.   (c) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of the Company
or the Stockholders for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement if
the Merger does not close. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall
be construed to mean that any representation, warranty or covenant made by
the Company is also made by any of the Stockholders, or vice versa.   7.6
RIGHT OF SET-OFF   Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to
the contrary, if the Escrow Fund shall be insufficient to satisfy any and all
Losses incurred by Parent, its officers, directors or affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) with respect to which any of them would
otherwise   -75-     EXECUTION COPY  be entitled to indemnification
under this Article VII ("EXCESS LOSSES"), Parent shall be entitled to set-off
any such Excess Losses against the Earn-Out Payment payable by Parent under
this Agreement as and when it becomes due. Any such payment shall be withheld
on a pro rata basis from the Earn-Out Payments otherwise then payable with
respect to each Earn-Out Payee. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to
exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or
limit Parent in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may
be available to it.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  
8.1 TERMINATION   Except as provided in SECTION 8.2 hereof, this Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:   (a) by unanimous agreement of the Company and Parent;   (b) by
Parent or the Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by March
31, 2003; provided, however, that such date shall be extended to June 30,
2003 in the event that the condition set forth in SECTION 6.1(a) or the
condition set forth in SECTION 6.1(b) has not been met; provided further,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 8.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes breach of
this Agreement;   (c) by Parent or the Company if: (i) there shall be a
final non-appealable order of a federal or state court in effect
preventing consummation of the Merger, or (ii) there shall be any statute,
rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable
to the Closing by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the
Closing illegal;   (d) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or
any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or
deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i)
prohibit Parent\'s ownership or operation of any portion of the business of
the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold
separate all or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or
Parent as a result of the Merger;   (e) by Parent if it is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained
in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in SECTION 6.2(a) hereof
would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured within fifteen (15)
calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however,
that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured;   -76-     EXECUTION COPY   (f) by the Company if it is not
in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been
a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in SECTION
6.3(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such breach has not been cured
within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice thereof to Parent;
provided, however, that no cure period shall be required for a breach which
by its nature cannot be cured;   (g) by Parent if there is a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or   (h) by the Company if there is a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION   In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in SECTION 8.1 hereof, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, the Company, or their respective officers,
directors or stockholders, if applicable; provided, however, that each party
hereto shall remain liable for any breaches of this Agreement prior to
its termination; and provided further, however, that, the provisions of
SECTIONS 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 hereof, ARTICLE IX hereof and this SECTION 8.2
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of this ARTICLE VIII.   8.3 AMENDMENT  
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party against
whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this SECTION 8.3, the
Stockholders agree that any amendment of this Agreement signed by the
Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against the
Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment.   8.4
EXTENSION; WAIVER   At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed,
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the
other party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1 NOTICES

A   EARN-OUT PAYMENT CONDITIONS   The Earn-Out Payment shall be paid if,
and only if, one or more of the following occurs on or before November 30,
2003:   1. The Company\'s Mercury product ("Target Product") has been
qualified for  general release to customers by either EMC Corporation or 
Hewlett-Packard Company (the "Qualification Condition"). Such  qualification
shall be deemed to occur upon notification by EMC  Corporation or Hewlett-
Packard Company that the product has been  qualified in a manner consistent
with the manner in which other  products of Parent have been qualified. This
condition will not be  deemed to be satisfied if the resources expended to
satisfy it exceed  the resources contemplated by the Qualification Project
Plan (as  defined below).   2. Parent cancels or requires the cancellation
of the Target Product  development and commercialization effort, unless the
reason for such  abandonment is Parent\'s good faith determination that the
Qualification  Condition is no longer achievable due to schedule delays or
budget  overruns.   3. Parent fails to devote to the Qualification Project
Plan at least the  number and type of personnel and all or substantially all
of the other  resources contemplated by the Qualification Project Plan and
such  failure is not corrected within fifteen (15) business days after
Parent  receives written notification thereof setting forth in reasonable 
detail the nature of the failure(s).   4. Parent makes or requires to be
made any material modification to the  Target Product specifications or
features, as in effect at the  Effective Date, which has the effect of
materially increasing the  amount of effort or time required to satisfy the
Qualification  Condition; unless the modification is approved by Michael
Klayko.   5. Parent makes or requires to be made a material change in the
required  application for the Target Product after agreement to such
application  by either EMC Corporation or Hewlett-Packard Company; unless
the  modification is approved by Michael Klayko.   SIGNATURE PAGE TO
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION     CONFIDENTIAL  WSGR DRAFT / /  
QUALIFICATION PROJECT PLAN   Beginning promptly after the date hereof,
representatives of Parent and the Company will work together in good faith to
develop, by January 15, 2003, a plan for the Target Product development and
other activities necessary to satisfy the Qualification Condition on or
before November 30, 2003 (the "Qualification Project Plan"). The
Qualification Project Plan will be based on the Company\'s third quarter 2002
financial plan for engineering and marketing attached hereto, with such
additions and subtractions to spending and headcount outlined in such plan to
adjust for (i) reprioritization of the Company\'s products (other than
Mercury) and (ii) Parent\'s undertaking to provide SQA, ops, manufacturing,
and general and administrative support. The Qualification Project Plan may be
amended, from time to time, in a writing signed by an authorized officer of
Parent and Michael Klayko (or any successor designated by Michael Klayko or
by any such successor).   The Qualification Project Plan will set forth,
among other things, the feature set, anticipated timetable, milestones,
required resources, responsibilities and target application(s). The
Qualification Project Plan will also identify the non-development resources
of Parent that will be required for execution of the plan, which will include
documentation, test, manufacturing, operations, information technology
infrastructure, source code, APIs and design specifications.   The
Qualification Project Plan will be approved by continuing Company management
and the management of Parent and will thereafter constitute the plan of
record for qualification of the Target Product.   If the parties cannot
agree on the Qualification Project Plan, then (i) the Qualification Project
Plan shall be the financial and headcount resources identified for the
Company\'s engineering and marketing organizations in the Q3 Plan, (ii) the
feature set shall be the feature set of the Mercury product as contemplated
on the date hereof as modified to ensure (a) Eport functionality compatible
with Parent\'s products, (b) manufacturability of the Target Product, (c)
compatibility with Parent\'s manageability APIs, and (d) quality
control acceptable to end-user customers.   SIGNATURE PAGE TO AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF REORGANIZATION     Page: 32  For the same reasons explained
above, this rep MUST be dated unless the buyer wants the Company to freeze
all development activity between signing and closing.    '
