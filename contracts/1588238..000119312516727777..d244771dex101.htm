Sellers, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Rice as follows (it
being understood that the representations and warranties set forth in this 
_Article IV_ are made giving effect to the Restructuring that will take place
prior to Closing):

 

4.1 _Organization_ , _Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its

and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business
it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties,
makes such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be duly
organized, validly existing, or to so qualify or be in good standing has not
had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company has
heretofore made available to Rice complete and correct copies of
its Organizational Documents, as well as the equivalent organizational
documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as of the date hereof. The
respective jurisdictions of formation of each Subsidiary of the Company are
identified on  _Schedule_ _ _ _4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

extent nonassessability may be affected by Section 18-607 of the Delaware LLC
Act) and the Company Interests are not subject to preemptive rights. There are
no Interests issued or outstanding in the Company other than the Company
Interests. All the Company Interests have been issued and granted in
compliance in all material respects with (i) applicable securities Laws and
other applicable Law and (ii) all requirements set forth in applicable
contracts. _Schedule_ _ _ _4.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and complete list that accurately reflects the record and beneficial
owners of all of the Interests of each Subsidiary of the Company. All

or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, (x) are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to
preemptive rights, (y) have been issued and granted in compliance in all
material respects with applicable securities Laws and other applicable Law
and all requirements set forth in applicable contracts and (z) are free and
clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. There are no

or agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party
or by which it is bound in any case obligating the Company or any 

 



18  Subsidiary of the Company to issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or
acquire, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or
acquired, additional Interests in the Company or its Subsidiaries, or
obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or
enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement.
There are not any stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other
agreements to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it
is bound relating to the voting of any Company Interests or Interests in the
Companys Subsidiaries, as the case may be. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Company does not have any direct or indirect (x) joint venture or other

_Section_ _ _ _4.12_ ) and environmental matters (which are provided for in

meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
or opinion letter as to its qualification, and nothing has occurred, whether

Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of

in all material respects. All material Taxes owed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or for which the Company and its Subsidiaries may be liable)

may be subject to any Tax in such jurisdiction, nor has any such assertion
been threatened or proposed in writing and received by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a party to any
material agreement or arrangement relating to the apportionment, sharing,

businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
(collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), except where the failure to
own or have the right to use such properties has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the use of the
Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of the business of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as

have taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets
used in the businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted, except where failure to do so has not had and would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and except with respect to any of the Companys Oil and Gas
Properties, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and
defensible title to all material real property owned by the Company or any of

licensed or otherwise occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to

Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, including the
improvements thereon, the " _Company Material Leased Real Property_ ")
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), (b)
each agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is the
landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with respect to the
Company Material Leased Real Property (each, a " _Company Material Real
Property Lease_ ") to the knowledge of the Company is in full force and effect
and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with
its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors Rights, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Company,
any other Person party thereto, has received written notice of any default

complete copy of each Company Material Real Property Lease (other than

4.15 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the dates of the reserve
report prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (the " _Company
Independent Petroleum Engineers_ ") relating to the Company interests
referred to therein as of December 31, 2015 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ ")
or (ii) reflected in the Company Reserve Report or in the Registration
Statement as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Report and
in each case as attributable to interests owned by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, " _good and defensible
title_ " means that the Companys or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the
Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned
by them as reflected in the Company Reserve Report) (1) entitles the Company
(or one or more of its

 



26  Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest
share shown in the Company Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from
such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas
Properties, (2) obligates the Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for
the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and
Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Company
Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive
differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on
the Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are
accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by the Company to
the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company interests
referred to in the Company Reserve Report, by or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and
gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve
Report was, as of the time provided, accurate in all respects. To the
Companys knowledge, there are no material errors in the assumptions and
estimates provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
preparation of the Company Reserve Report. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve Report are derived
from reports that have been prepared by the Company Independent Petroleum
Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the
oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates indicated therein and are in
accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting
the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including
changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has
been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve
Report that have had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases have been properly
and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties
and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned
or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and
properly paid, (iii) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to
the Companys knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision
of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil
and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any other party to any such
Oil and Gas Lease that any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach or default under any Oil and Gas Lease.

 



27 (d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil
and Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being received by
them in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason
other than (i) awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled wells or (ii) as may be permitted by applicable
Law, in each case, except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) All of the wells and all water, CO2 or injection wells located on any
of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
otherwise associated with an Oil and Gas Properties of the Company or its
Subsidiaries have been drilled, completed and operated within the limits
permitted by the applicable Oil and Gas Lease and/or Oil and Gas
Contract, except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(f) All Oil and Gas Properties operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been operated in compliance with the applicable Oil and Gas
Leases, except where the failure to so operate would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and, except any wells
for which an extension was granted by a Governmental Entity or pursuant to any
applicable Law, there is no well included in the Oil and Gas Properties for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently obligated to plug
and abandon pursuant to the express terms of any Oil and Gas Lease, Oil and
Gas Contract or applicable Law.

 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule_ _ _ _4.15(g)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no outstanding
authorization for expenditure or similar request or invoice for funding or
participation under any agreement or contract which is binding on the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any Oil and Gas Properties and which the Company
reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures by the Company
or any of its Subsidiary in excess of $5,000,000.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is obligated by
virtue of a prepayment arrangement, make up right under a production sales
contract containing a " _take or pay_ " or similar provision, production
payment or any other arrangement (other than gas balancing arrangements) to
deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale thereof, attributable to the
Oil and Gas Properties of such Person at some future time without then or
thereafter receiving the full contract price therefor.

and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,

such liability or obligation;

 

(c) there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at any property
currently or, to the knowledge of the Company, formerly owned, operated or

Company, which Releases are reasonably likely to result in a liability to the
Company under Environmental Law;

(d) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice asserting a liability or obligation under any Environmental
Laws with respect to the investigation, remediation, removal, or monitoring of
the Release of any Hazardous Materials at or from any property currently or
formerly owned, operated, or otherwise used by the Company, or at or from any
off-site location where Hazardous Materials from the Companys operations have
been sent for treatment, disposal storage or handling; and

 

(e) there have been no environmental investigations, studies, audits, or
other analyses or reports conducted during the past three (3) years by or on

Subsidiaries to any Tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by

provisions contained in any agreement entered into in the ordinary course
of business and not primarily relating to Tax).

Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to
own or have the right to use such properties has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Rice Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Rice, the use of the Rice Intellectual
Property by Rice and its Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of each

occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to other occupancy
arrangements, including easements and rights-of-way) by Rice or any Subsidiary
of Rice (collectively, including the improvements thereon, the " _Rice
Material Leased Real Property_ ") free and clear of all Encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances), (b) each agreement under which Rice or any
Subsidiary of Rice is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or
occupant with respect to the Rice Material Leased Real Property (each, a "

force and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in

Rights, and neither Rice nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
Rice, any other Person party thereto, has received written notice of any

5.15 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Rice
Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise

reflected in the Rice Reserve Report or in the Rice SEC Documents as having
been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, Rice and its
Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Rice Reserve Report and in
each case as attributable to interests owned by Rice and its Subsidiaries,
free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, " _good and defensible title_ " means that
Rices or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held
or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them as reflected in the
Rice Reserve Report) (1) entitles Rice (or one or more of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens
applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the
Rice Reserve Report of all hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and
Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (2)
obligates Rice (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a
percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of,
and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than

Properties (other than any positive differences in such percentage) and the
applicable working interest shown on the Rice Reserve Report for such Oil and
Gas Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net
revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of
all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

to the Rice Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Rice interests
referred to in the Rice Reserve Report, by or on behalf of Rice and its
Subsidiaries that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas
reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Rice and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Rice Reserve Report
was, as of the time provided, accurate in all respects. To the Rices
knowledge, there are no material errors in the assumptions and estimates
provided by Rice and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of
the Rice Reserve Report. Except for any such matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Rice
Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Rice set forth
in the Rice Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been prepared
by the Rice Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly
reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Rice at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable
thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Rice Reserve Report that has had or would be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Rice Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Rice Material Adverse Effect, all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases have been properly
and timely paid and (iii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding
royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by Rice or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
and properly paid, (iv) none of Rice or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the
Rices knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or
taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil
and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Rice or
any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) none of Rice or any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any other party to any such Oil and Gas Lease
that Rice or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under any Oil and
Gas Lease.

and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,

currently or, to the knowledge of Rice, formerly owned, operated or otherwise

site location where Hazardous Materials from Rices operations have been sent
for treatment, disposal storage or handling; and

 

(e) there have been no environmental investigations, studies, audits, or
other analyses or reports conducted during the past three (3) years by or on
behalf of, or that are in the possession of, Rice or its Subsidiaries

other compensation and employee benefits to be determined by Rice in its
discretion.

(d) The Vantage Sellers agree to cause the accrued benefits and account
balances of Rehired Employees under the 401(k) plan sponsored, maintained or
otherwise made available by Vantage Management to be 100% vested effective as
of the Closing Date and to cause such plan to allow for the rollover of such
account balances to a 401(k) plan maintained by Rice or one of its Affiliates,
including, if requested and to the extent permitted under the applicable
401(k) plans, outstanding plan loans which, upon such request, the Vantage
Sellers agree will not be placed into default.

(e) If a Rehired Employees employment with Rice or one of its post-
Closing Affiliates, as applicable (each, a " _Continuing Employer_ "), is
terminated during the six-month period following the Closing Date pursuant to
an Involuntary Termination (as defined below), then the Continuing Employer
shall provide severance to such Rehired Employee in an amount equal to the
sum of (i) six months worth of such Rehired Employees base salary or base
wage rate and (ii) half of such Rehired Employees target level annual bonus
opportunity for the calendar year in which the termination of such Rehired
Employees employment occurs (or, if no such annual bonus opportunity exists,
half of the amount of the annual bonus, if any, paid to such Rehired Employee
for the immediately preceding year), paid in a lump sum cash payment no later
than 60 days following the date of the termination of such Rehired Employees
employment. For purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _6.6(d)_ , "Involuntary
Termination" means, with respect to a Rehired Employee, any termination of
such Rehired Employees employment with Rice or its post-Closing Affiliates
that does not result from a resignation by such Rehired Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Involuntary Termination" shall not
include a termination as a result of (1) death or disability, as determined
under the long-term disability plan in which such Rehired Employee
participates (or, if such Rehired Employee does not participate in any long-
term disability plan, as determined under the long-term disability plan

 



55  maintained by the entity employing such Rehired Employee for similarly
situated employees, as if such Rehired Employee participated in such plan), or
(2) for bona-fide performance related reasons or due to such Rehired
Employees (I) willful misconduct or material failure to perform material
employment-related duties, (II) indictment for a crime that enriches any
Person at the expense of Rice or any of its post-Closing Affiliates, or (III)
embezzlement or other misappropriation of funds or assets of Rice or any of
its post-Closing Affiliates.

 

(f) To the extent that any liabilities or obligations under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et. seq.,
the regulations and rules thereunder, or under any similar provision of any
federal, state, foreign or local Law (collectively, a " _WARN Obligation_ ")
arise with respect to any loss of employment by any employee of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the Management Company as a result of Rices
actions, inactions or conduct in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Rice shall be solely responsible for such WARN Obligation
and any associated obligations.

(g) After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Rice reasonable access during normal business hours and on at least one
Business Days notice to, and facilitate meetings with, Vantage Personnel or
for purposes of making announcements concerning and preparing for the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and its Affiliates shall not without the prior written consent of Rice, make
any communications to Vantage Personnel regarding their employment with Rice
after the Closing Date.

 

(h) If, at any time between the date hereof and the date that is six months
after the Closing, Rice or any of its Affiliates makes an offer of employment
to any Vantage Personnel who were not included on the Rehired Employee
Disclosure, then such offer shall be on terms consistent with the terms of the
Offers described in this _Section 6.6_. If, at any time between the date
hereof and the date that is six months after the Closing, Rice or any of its
Affiliates employs or engages any Vantage Personnel who were not included on
the Rehired Employee Disclosure (other than through the Consulting Agreements
contemplated on _Exhibits A-1_ and _A-2_ hereto), then Rice shall reimburse
the Management Company or its applicable Affiliate for all severance costs, if
any, paid by such entity to the applicable Vantage Personnel between the date
hereof and the date that is 90 days following the Closing. In the event that
Rice or its Affiliate employs or engages any Vantage Personnel as described in
the immediately preceding sentence, Rice or such Affiliate shall provide
the Vantage Sellers with notice of such hiring or retention within three days
of the applicable employment or engagement. The Vantage Sellers shall provide
Rice with notice of the applicable severance costs that are subject to
reimbursement, which reimbursement shall be paid within 30 days following
Rices receipt of such notice.

(i) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Rice, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Rehired Employee or other current or former employee (or spouse
or dependent thereof) of the

 



56  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns) any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in
this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ ) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall give any employee or other service
provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person any
right to continued employment or service, nor shall this Agreement restrict
the right of Rice or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or
service of any service provider after the Closing.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Closing and until the six year
anniversary of the Closing, Rice shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Closing, a director, officer or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties,
expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (with the
approval of the indemnifying party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), of or incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or
is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on
or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Closing and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including
all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in
each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Rice shall
pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final
disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any
Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Closing), (i) the
Indemnified Persons may retain Rices regularly engaged legal counsel or other
counsel satisfactory to them, and Rice shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as
statements therefor are received, and (ii) Rice shall use its best efforts to
assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to
claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this _Section_ _ _
_6.7_ , upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify Rice (but the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it
may have under this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_  except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such partys position with respect to such claims). With
respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification by Rice under this  _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ , such Indemnified
Person shall have the right to require that such determination be made by
special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and
approved by Rice (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Rice or
the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.

 



57 (b) Rice shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in
the Organizational Documents of Rice in any manner that would affect (or
manage Rice or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to affect) adversely the
rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of any Indemnified
Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent
required by applicable Law. Rice shall fulfill and honor any indemnification,
expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company and any of
its directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the
Closing.

(c) Rice shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in
_Section_ _ _ _6.7(a)_ , relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified
Persons rights under this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ or under any charter, bylaw or
contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately
determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

 

(d) Rice will cause to be put in place, and Rice shall fully prepay
immediately prior to the Closing, " _tail_ " insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from the Closing from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as Rices current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as Rices existing policies with respect to
matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Rice may elect in its sole discretion to, but
shall not be required to, spend more than 300% (the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the
last annual premium paid by Rice prior to the date hereof for the six years of
coverage under such tail policy;  _provided_ _further_ that if the cost of
such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, and Rice elects not to spend more than
the Cap Amount for such purpose, then Rice shall purchase as much coverage as
is obtainable for the Cap Amount.

 

(e) In the event that Rice or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Rice shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ _ _ _6.7_. The provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each
Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense
advancement pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_ , and his heirs and
representatives. Rice shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render Rice unable to satisfy its
obligations under this _Section_ _ _ _6.7_.

 

6.8 _Agreement to Defend_. In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental
Entity or other Person is commenced that questions the validity or legality
of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties
agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto.

 



58 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The parties will not, and each of the
foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public
announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the
parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a party or its Representatives may
issue a public announcement or other public disclosures required by applicable
Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such partys capital stock
is traded, provided such party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the
other party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed
disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same; _provided_ _further_
that no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner
(i) any partys ability to communicate with its employees or equity holders or
(ii) Rices or any Vantage Sellers ability to communicate with its financial
and legal advisors, lenders, underwriters or financing sources.

6.10 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to
compliance with applicable Law, the Vantage Sellers and Rice, as the case may
be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other, report on operational
matters and shall promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any
change or event having, or which would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Rice
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. Except with respect to the HSR
Act as provided in _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , the Vantage Sellers and Rice shall
promptly provide each other (or their respective counsel) copies of all
filings made by such party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.
Without limiting in any way any partys rights or obligations under this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any party, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other parties and their
respective Subsidiaries operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, each of the parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.11 _Filing of Tax Returns_. The Vantage Sellers shall prepare or cause
to be prepared all income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Period required to be filed after the Closing Date. Rice shall
prepare or cause to be prepared all other Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. With respect to any Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Period or
any Straddle Period, the party or parties responsible for preparing such Tax
Return shall (i) prepare such return on a basis consistent with past
practice, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law; (ii) not
later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(other than Tax Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that
are required to be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close
of a Tax period) deliver a draft of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to the other parties for their review
and reasonable comment; and (iii) cause such Tax Return (as revised to
incorporate the other parties reasonable comments) to be timely filed and
will provide a copy thereof to the other parties.

 

6.12 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the
Transactions, if any, shall be paid by Rice when due, whether levied on Rice,
the Company, the Vantage Sellers or any Subsidiary thereof, and Rice shall
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any
such Transfer Taxes. Rice shall reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Vantage Sellers and their respective Affiliates against liability
for any such Transfer Taxes. The parties will cooperate, in good faith, in the
filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes and
the minimization, to the extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law,
of the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

 



59 6.13 _Tax_ _Characterization_ _and Other Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The parties intend that, for U.S. federal income (and applicable state
and local) tax purposes, (i) the Company (which is itself a continuation of
Vantage II for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.708-1(c)) will continue as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Section 708(a) of the Code following the Closing Date,
except to the extent the transactions described in clause (ii)(A) of this
_Section 6.13(a)_ result in a technical termination of the Company under
Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, (ii) Rice will be treated as (A)
purchasing the Company Interests that were acquired by Rice Appalachia from
the relevant Vantage Sellers in exchange for the Cash Consideration and/or the
Deposit and then (B) contributing all of the assets and liabilities of Rice
Appalachia (other than the Company Interests purchased by Rice Appalachia
pursuant to clause (ii)(A) of this Section 6.13(a)) to the Company in exchange
for Company Interests, and (iii) the Company will be treated as converting all
of the Company Interests held by the Vantage Sellers and Rice following the
transactions described in clauses (ii)(A) and (ii)(B) of this _Section
6.13(a)_ into Rice Appalachia Units in a recapitalization event. To the extent
permitted under applicable Law, each of the parties agrees not to make any
tax filing or otherwise take any position inconsistent with this _Section
6.13(a)_ and to cooperate with each other party to make any filings,
statements or reports required to effect, disclose or report the Transactions
as described in this _Section 6.13(a)_ , including as described in _Section
6.13(b)_.

(b) Not later than 30 days after the Closing, the parties shall cooperate
in good faith to prepare and agree to a statement reflecting a valuation of
all of the assets of the Company and Rice Appalachia in accordance with the
principles of Sections 1060 and 755 of the Code, as applicable (the " _Tax
Allocation Statement_ "). The parties agree to (i) be bound by the Tax
Allocation Statement (if agreed) and (ii) act in accordance with the Tax
Allocation Statement (if agreed) in the preparation, filing and audit of any
Tax Return; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall require any
party to amend any Tax Return filed prior to the Closing to be consistent with
the Tax Allocation Statement or shall prevent any party from settling
any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity based upon
or arising out of the allocation specified in the Tax Allocation Statement,
and neither party shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity challenging such
allocation.

(c) Consistent with Section 6.13(a) above, as the continuing partnership
following the Transactions, the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
will be called Rice Appalachia after the Transactions), and each Subsidiary of
the Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, shall each make an election under Section 754 of the Code and under
corresponding provisions of applicable statute and local tax laws for the
taxable year of the Company that ends on or includes the Closing Date.

 

6.14 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The parties shall cooperate fully as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding
relating to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,

 



60  operations or activities of the Company. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or audit,
litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 

6.15 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this  _Article_ _ _ _VI_ , upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions.

 

(b) The Vantage Sellers shall give prompt notice to Rice, and Rice shall
give prompt notice to the Vantage Sellers, upon becoming aware of (i) any
condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in
_Sections_ _ _ _7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the failure by such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 

6.16 _No-Shop_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Vantage Sellers will,
and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective Representatives to, immediately cease, and cause to
be terminated, any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with
any Person conducted heretofore by the Vantage Sellers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with
respect to any Alternative Transaction.

 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Vantage Sellers will
not, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to, directly or

practice (and, in any event, not in connection with or in response to an
Alternative Transaction or any indication of interest that would or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction) or (iv) enter
into any letter of intent or agreement in principle, or other agreement
providing for an Alternative Transaction.

62 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Vantage Sellers, Vantage I, Vantage II and the Company shall be deemed to
have complied with _Section 6.17(a)_ and _Section 6.17(b)_ unless and until

Breach of a representation or warranty or a Willful and Material Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder or fraud.

Agreement, then the Vantage Sellers shall receive the Deposit as liquidated
damages (including but not limited to with respect to any costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with legal, financial and other advisors and

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice
of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties
shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed
against any party by reason of its

 



69  preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party
that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Vantage Seller Disclosure
Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such
information in the Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the
Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter, as
applicable, that such items are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, the Vantage Sellers or Rice, as the case may be, or that
such items have resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect, Vantage Seller
Material Adverse Effect or Rice Material Adverse Effect. The headings, if any,
of the individual sections of each of the Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter
and the Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall
not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The
Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of (i) an item in one section of the
Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a particular representation or warranty and (ii) disclosures
made in the Registration Statement shall in each case be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or
warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent from such item,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Vantage Seller Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter
with respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate
cross reference thereto.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Vantage Seller Disclosure
Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such
amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy
between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter
(whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles,
Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of

FORTH IN _SECTION 9.7(b)_ AND MUTATIS MUTANDIS BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE COURTS
SPECIFIED IN THIS _SECTION 9.7(d)_.

 

9.8 _Severability_. Each party agrees that, should any court or other
competent Governmental Entity hold any provision of this Agreement or part
hereof to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such other
term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Except
as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, in response to an order from a
court or other competent Governmental Entity for any party to take any action
inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required
hereby, to the extent that a party hereto took an action inconsistent with
this Agreement or failed to take action consistent with this Agreement or
required by this Agreement pursuant to such order, such party shall not incur
any liability or obligation unless such party did not in good faith seek to
resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order.

 

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, without the consent of any party, each
Vantage Seller shall be entitled to assign, in whole or in part, its rights
and obligations under this Agreement prior to the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement to any Person or Persons, the sole owners, directly or
indirectly, of which are one or more members of Vantage I or Vantage II, but
no such assignment shall release such Vantage Seller from its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this _Section_ _ _ _9.9_ shall be void.

 

9.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as
a " _Company Affiliate_ ": (i) any direct or indirect holder of equity
interests or securities in the Vantage Sellers (whether limited or general
partners, members, stockholders or otherwise), and (ii) any director, officer,
employee, representative or agent of (a) the Company, (b) the Vantage Sellers
or (b) any Person who controls the Company or any Vantage Seller. Other than
as set forth in _Section 9.14_ , no Company Affiliate shall have any liability
or obligation to Rice of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under

or under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and the Vantage Sellers and the Company hereby waive and release all claims
of any such liability and obligation.

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that
may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (on
behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement) (a)
a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Each party further agrees that no other
party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ _ _ _9.11_ , and each party
hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Vantage Sellers, Vantage I or Vantage II
be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Rices obligation to
consummate the Transactions if this Agreement is capable of being terminated
by the Vantage Sellers under _Article VIII_ , and Rice has agreed that the
Vantage Sellers have such termination right and have provided instructions to
the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to the Vantage Sellers accordingly, in
which event the receipt of the Deposit as contemplated by, and on the terms
set forth in, _Section 8.3_ thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy.

 

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties; _provided,
however_ , that no amendment, modification or supplement shall be made to this
Agreement that would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources as
set forth in _Section 8.3_ , _Section 9.6_ ,  _Section 9.7_ , this _Section
9.12_ and _Section 9.15_ without the consent of the Financing Sources.

 

9.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the Vantage
Sellers and Rice may, to the extent legally allowed:

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts
of the other parties hereunder;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;
or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
parties contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Rice or any Vantage
Seller in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be effective or enforceable
unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



74 9.14 _Vantage I and Vantage II_. Prior to the consummation of the
Restructuring, each of Vantage I and Vantage II hereby agrees to cause the
applicable Vantage Seller to perform all undertakings, obligations and
required acts of such Vantage Seller hereunder and hereby absolutely,
irrevocably, primarily and unconditionally guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful performance of such undertakings, obligations and required acts by
such Vantage Seller.

 

9.15 _Provisions Related to the Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Vantage
Sellers, Vantage I, Vantage II and the Company agree that neither it nor any
of its Representatives or Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with or related to this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In
addition, no Financing Source shall have any liability or obligation to the
Vantage Sellers, Vantage I, Vantage II, the Company or any of the their
respective Representatives or Affiliates in connection with or related to
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including for any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or
indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated
savings) or damages of a tortious nature and the Company agrees not to and to
cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from any Financing Source.
