Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and in a manner
reasonably consistent with the Allocated Values, and will be set forth in
separate schedules proposed by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the
" _Tax Allocations_ "). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the Tax
Allocations within 15 days of delivery of proposed schedules by Seller, the
matter will be submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for binding resolution
in accordance with _Section 3.6_. Buyer and Seller shall each bear their own
respective costs of obtaining such resolution, except that any fees and
expenses related to the procurement of services from an Accounting Arbitrator

Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) neither they nor their Affiliates
will take positions inconsistent with such Tax Allocations in notices to
Governmental Authorities, in audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes,

notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as
required by applicable Law. Seller makes no representation or warranty as to
the accuracy of any value determined hereunder.

and

(i) not commit to do any of the items described in _Section 6.1(c)_, _Section
6.1(d)_, _Section 6.1(g)_ and _Section 6.1(h)_.

 

Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
Properties where Seller is not the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts
or omissions of the other working interests owners (including the operators)
who are not Seller or any Affiliates of Seller shall not constitute a breach
of the provisions of this _Section 6.1_, nor shall any action required by a
vote of working interest owners constitute such a breach so long as Seller
and its Affiliates have not proposed an action that would be in violation of
this _Section 6.1_ and, subject to _Section 6.1(d)_, have voted their
interest in a manner that complies with the provisions of this _Section
6.1_.

Section 6.2 _Notification of Breaches_. Until the Closing,

(a) Buyer shall notify Seller promptly after Buyer obtains actual knowledge
that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement is

performed or observed in any material respect.

Any of Buyers or Sellers representations or warranties that are untrue or
shall become untrue in any material respect between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date, and any of Buyers or Sellers covenants or agreements to
be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date that have not been

have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement to the extent that any such
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is (if curable)
cured by the Closing.

Section 6.3 _Successor Operator_. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to
succeed Seller as operator of those Assets or portions thereof that Seller may
presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does
not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become successor operator of the
same since the Assets or portions thereof may be subject to operating or other
agreements that control the appointment of a successor operator. Seller
agrees, however, that as to the Assets it operates, it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyers efforts to become successor
operator (to the extent permitted under any joint operating agreement)
effective as of the Closing and to designate and/or appoint by assignment,
to the extent legally possible, Buyer as successor operator effective as of
the Closing.

Section 6.4  _Governmental Bonds_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds,
letters of credit and guarantees set forth on _Schedule 4.26_ that have been

credit and guarantees posted by Seller and/or its Affiliates.

seven years and as required by Law, following Closing, will retain the
Records and provide the other party, its Affiliates, and its and their
officers, employees and representatives with reasonable access upon prior
notice to the Records (to the extent that such other party has not retained
the original or a copy) during normal business hours for review and copying at
such other partys expense; _provided_ that any party may destroy Records from
time to time and prior to the end of such period in accordance with its
normal document retention policy as long as such party notifies the other
party in advance and provides such other party an opportunity to copy such
Records at such other partys expense. Each party shall also provide the other
party, its Affiliates and its and their officers, employees and
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to Records
relating to any indemnification claim made under this Agreement for review and
copying at such other partys expense.

Section 6.6 _License_. Buyer hereby grants to Carrizo and its wholly-owned
Affiliates, effective from and after the Closing Date, a royalty-free
perpetual license, without restriction, of all Seismic Data and Information
that, immediately before the Closing, was owned (but not licensed from a Third
Party) by Seller or its Affiliate. The license granted pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ is not assignable without consent of Buyer unless such
assignment occurs in connection with the direct or indirect sale of all or
substantially all of the assets or control of Carrizo. 

Section 6.7 _Like-Kind Exchange_. Buyer shall cooperate fully, to the extent
reasonably requested by Seller, in connection with accommodating an exchange
as provided for under Section 1031 or similar section of the Code and any
corresponding state income tax provision (" _Like-Kind Exchange_ "). Seller
reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights under this
Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchase Price, and that
portion of the Assets associated therewith, to a qualified intermediary (as
that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii))
to accomplish this transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will
comply with the requirements of a Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer hereby (a)
consents to Sellers assignment of its rights in this Agreement with respect
to the Like-Kind Exchange Assets and (b) if such an assignment is made, agrees
to transfer all or a portion of the Purchase Price into the qualified trust
account at Closing as directed in writing by Seller;  _provided_ that the
Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of the Like-Kind Exchange.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that a whole or partial assignment of this
Agreement to a qualified intermediary shall not release Seller from any of
its respective liabilities and obligations to Buyer or expand any liabilities
or obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer shall not be obligated to
pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in its purchase
of the Assets if such costs are the result of Sellers Like-Kind Exchange,
and Seller shall indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Claims
arising from Sellers Like-Kind Exchange. No representations are made that any
particular tax treatment will be given to either party as a result of the
Like-Kind Exchange.

 



27 Section 6.8 _Delivery of Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer on or
before the 65th day after the Closing Date, in each case, only to the extent
required of Buyer by Form 8-K under the Exchange Act, a statement of revenues
and direct operating expenses relating to the Assets for years ended December
31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the three month period ended March 31, 2012, and
a statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the Assets
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and March 31, 2012 and the related footnotes
for both statements (the " _Asset Financial Statements_ "), as shall be
reasonably necessary for inclusion in Buyers current report on Form 8-K under
the Exchange Act to be filed on or before the 71st calendar day after the
initial Form 8-K to be filed within four business days following the closing.
Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, Seller shall have no
obligation to provide any portion of the Asset Financial Statements that is
not required by Form 8-K and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the periods and dates presented of financial statements and other
information to be included in such Asset Financial Statements that would
otherwise be required by Form 8-K, including, by promptly seeking waivers,
exemptions or advice from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Buyer on or before the date of the filing of the Asset Financial Statements
with Buyers Form 8-K, the report of KPMG LLP with respect to those portions
of the Asset Financial Statements to be delivered under this Section for which
such report is required by Form 8-K. Furthermore, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause KPMG LLP to deliver to Buyer any unqualified
audit opinions with respect to the Asset Financial Statements as may be
required by any applicable securities Laws in connection with any future
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be made by Buyer.

 

(b) All of the Asset Financial Statements, reports, opinions and related
activities (the " _Asset Financial Statement Matters_ ") to be prepared,
provided, delivered or undertaken pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall be
prepared, provided, delivered and undertaken at the sole cost and expense of
Buyer. The costs and expenses to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
6.8_ shall be included in the Final Settlement Statement and shall be paid
promptly by Buyer to Seller or KPMG LLP simultaneously with the payment of
amounts to be paid by Buyer or Seller pursuant to  _Section 3.5_.

Section 6.9 _Sublease of Field Office_. During the period of time between the
Execution Date and the Closing, Buyer and Seller will in good faith negotiate
a mutually agreeable sublease for the Mansfield field office to be retained by
Seller such that Buyer shall have the right following the Closing to access
and utilize such Mansfield field office, warehouse and yard in connection
with its ownership and operation of the Assets.

ACCESS; CONFIDENTIALITY; USE; DISCLAIMERS

 

Section 9.1 _Access_.

(a) From and after the date hereof and up to delivery of the Records to Buyer
as provided in _Section 8.4_ (or earlier termination of this Agreement) but
subject to the other provisions of this  _Section 9.1_ and obtaining any
required consents of Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the
Assets (with respect to which consents Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain), Seller shall afford to Buyer and its officers,
employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, consultants and other authorized
representatives (" _Buyer s Representatives_") reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records and other documents in
Sellers or its Affiliates possession relating primarily to the Assets.
Seller shall also make available to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, Sellers and Sellers
Affiliates personnel knowledgeable with respect to the Assets so that Buyer
may make such reasonable diligence investigation as Buyer considers reasonably
necessary or appropriate. All investigations and due diligence conducted by
Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost,
risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer
or any Buyers Representative shall result from Buyers own
independent review and judgment and shall be conducted so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of the business of Seller and shall not
require Seller to waive any attorney-client privilege nor to violate any
contractual obligation. In addition, Seller shall provide Buyer with access
to any records and to Sellers Representatives to the extent reasonably
requested and necessary to respond to any tax audit or inquiry suggesting that
Buyer is liable as successor, transferee or member of a group having joint
and several liability for any Taxes payable by Buyer but allocated to Seller
or its Affiliates under _Section 14.1_; _provided, however,_ Seller shall not
be required to take any action pursuant to this  _Section 9.1_ which would

(b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property
assessment with respect to the Assets. Seller or its designee shall have the
right to accompany Buyer and Buyers Representatives whenever they are on site
on the Assets and also to collect split test samples if any are collected.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access
to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence
(including any Phase I environmental property assessments) with respect to
any Assets where Seller does not have the authority to grant access for such
due diligence ( _provided, however_ , Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain permission from any Third Party to allow Buyer
and Buyers Representatives such access). In the event that Buyers Phase I
environmental property assessments identify actual or potential "recognized
environmental conditions", then Buyer may request Sellers permission to
conduct additional Phase II environmental property assessments to further
assess such conditions. Any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigation activities shall be considered "Phase II" activities. The 

 



34  additional Phase II environmental property assessment procedures relating to
any additional investigation shall be submitted to Seller in a Phase II
environmental property assessment plan, which shall include a written
description of the proposed scope of the Phase II assessment, including a
description of the activities to be conducted, and a description of the
approximate location and expected timing of such activities. Seller may, in
its sole discretion, approve said Phase II environmental property assessment
plan, in whole or in part, and Buyer shall not have the right to conduct any
activities set forth in such plan until such time that Seller has approved
such plan in writing. Any such approved Phase II environmental property
assessment plan shall be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or
engineering firm, approved in advance by Seller (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, once approved, such environmental
consulting or engineering firm shall be deemed to be a "Buyers
Representative," and any such assessment shall be performed in accordance with
this _Section 9.1_ and in compliance with all Laws. 

(c) Buyer shall coordinate any environmental property assessments and physical
inspections of the Assets with Seller and all applicable Third Party
operators to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of
business by Seller or such Third Party operators. Buyer shall abide by
Sellers and any Third Party operators safety rules, regulations and
operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the
Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of the
Assets. Buyer hereby defends, indemnifies and holds harmless each of the
operators of the Assets and Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all personal injury or property damage actually resulting from the access
permitted pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ and the related due diligence
activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative with respect to the
Assets, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN
PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES.

 

(d) Buyer will promptly provide a copy of any final environmental report
prepared by any Third Party environmental consultant to Seller. Seller shall
not be deemed by its receipt of said documents or otherwise as a result of
Buyers environmental assessment process to have made any representation or
warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets
or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein, it
being understood that Sellers only representations or warranties with respect
to environmental matters shall be those set forth in _Section 4.16_ of
this Agreement.

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates, (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence
in a manner that restores the Assets to the approximate same or better
condition existing prior to commencement of Buyers due diligence and (ii)
remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in
connection with Buyers due diligence. Any damage to the Assets (including the
leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Buyers due diligence will be
promptly corrected by Buyer.

 



35 (f) Buyer and Seller agree that the environmental consultant, as a condition
to its entry onto any of the Assets, shall obtain insurance coverage for
general liability in an amount not less than $3,000,000 per occurrence and
hold professional liability insurance. If the environmental consultant or
Buyer fails to provide Seller with evidence of such insurance, Seller may
deny the environmental consultant the right to enter upon the Assets.

 

Section 9.2 _Confidentiality; Use_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access to the Records or
the Assets, Buyer will become privy to confidential and other information of
Seller and that such confidential information shall be held confidential by
Buyer and Buyers Representatives in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing
confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to the Excluded
Assets). Notwithstanding anything therein to the contrary, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in effect until Closing, or if the Closing does not
occur, until December 13, 2012. 

(b) If the Closing should occur, from and after the Closing and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
consultants and other representatives (" _Seller s Representatives_") not to,
disclose, use or copy any trade secrets and or proprietary or confidential
information solely relating to the Assets, except for (i) disclosures and uses
required by Law or stock exchange rules or information that has become part of
the public domain through no action of Seller or Sellers Representatives
after the Closing, (ii) disclosures to Affiliates and (iii) disclosures to
financial institutions or other Third Party in connection with evaluation of a
financing, sales or acquisition transaction provided that such financial
institution or other Third Party is bound by a reasonable obligation of
confidentiality covering such information. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing and anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall have
the non-exclusive right to use in the ordinary course of business any
information about the Assets, including copies (retained by Seller) of (A) any
geophysical and other seismic and related technical data and information
relating to the Assets (including copies of any geologic and geophysical
interpretations retained pursuant to _Section 2.1(i)_) and (B) any maps,
engineering data and reports, reserve studies and evaluations, logs, Records
or other data and information being transferred as part of the Assets;
_provided, however_ , that, except as required by Law, Seller shall, and shall
cause Sellers Representatives and each of their respective Affiliates to (i)
keep such data and information confidential in accordance with the terms
hereof, (ii) require any Third Party consultant or advisor to keep such
information confidential in accordance with the terms hereof and (iii)
continue to comply with the obligations under any Third Party confidentiality
agreements with respect to such data or information or the Assets pursuant to
the terms of such Third Party confidentiality agreements.

Section 9.3 _Disclaimers_.

(a) Except as and to the extent expressly set forth in _Article IV_ , or the
special warranties of title contained in the Conveyance Documents, (i) Seller
makes no representations or warranties, express, statutory or implied, and
(ii) Seller expressly disclaims all liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, statement or information made or communicated

 



36  (orally or in writing) to Buyer or any of its affiliates, employees, agents,

AGREEMENT OR THE SPECIAL WARRANTIES OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCE

REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATING THERETO AND (IX)
ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF FREEDOM FROM PATENT OR TRADEMARK
INFRINGEMENT.

(c) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY REPRESENTED OTHERWISE IN _ARTICLE_ _IV_ OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE SPECIAL WARRANTIES OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCE
DOCUMENTS, SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY
OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FREEDOM FROM LATENT VICES OR DEFECTS, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OF
ANY ASSETS, RIGHTS OF A PURCHASER UNDER APPROPRIATE STATUTES TO CLAIM
DIMINUTION OF CONSIDERATION OR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, IT BEING
EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BY THE PARTIES HERETO THAT, SUBJECT TO
BUYERS RIGHTS UNDER _SECTION 12.2(A)_, BUYER SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE OBTAINING
THE ASSETS, INCLUDING THE SEISMIC DATA AND INFORMATION, IN THEIR PRESENT
STATUS, CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR, "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" WITH ALL FAULTS
OR DEFECTS (KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, LATENT, DISCOVERABLE OR UNDISCOVERABLE), AND
THAT BUYER HAS MADE OR CAUSED TO BE MADE SUCH INSPECTIONS OF THE ASSETS,
INCLUDING THE SEISMIC DATA AND INFORMATION, AS BUYER DEEMS APPROPRIATE. 

 



37 (d) OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN _SECTION 4.16_, SELLER HAS
NOT AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING ANY MATTER OR
CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, THE RELEASE OF MATERIALS INTO THE
ENVIRONMENT OR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES OR

WITH ALL FAULTS FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION AND THAT BUYER
HAS MADE OR CAUSED TO BE MADE SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTIONS AS BUYER DEEMS
APPROPRIATE. INCLUSION OF A MATTER ON A SCHEDULE ATTACHED HERETO WITH RESPECT
TO A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT ADDRESSES MATTERS HAVING A MATERIAL

MAY, HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. SCHEDULES MAY INCLUDE MATTERS NOT
REQUIRED BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT TO BE LISTED ON THE SCHEDULE, WHICH
ADDITIONAL MATTERS ARE DISCLOSED FOR PURPOSES OF INFORMATION ONLY, AND
INCLUSION OF ANY SUCH MATTER DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL SUCH MATTERS ARE INCLUDED.

 

SELLER AND BUYER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE
EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.3_ ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS FOR
THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW.

 

ARTICLE X

 

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTIES; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

Section 10.1 _Seller s Title_.

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Except for
the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyance Documents and
without limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article
X_ , Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory
or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to any of the Wells, Fee
Interests or Undrilled Locations, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect,
with respect to any of the Wells, Fee Interests or Undrilled Locations (i)
before the Title Claim Date, shall be as set forth in _Section 10.2_ and (ii)
after the Title Claim Date, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of
title set forth in the Conveyance Documents.

(b) _Special Warranty of Title_. If the Closing occurs, then effective as of
the Closing Date in the Conveyance Documents, the Assets are being conveyed by
Seller "WHERE IS" and "AS IS", and without any warranty of title, express or
implied, except as to claims made by, through or under Seller, subject,
_however_ , to the Permitted Encumbrances. Said special warranties of title
contained in the Conveyance Documents shall be subject to the further
limitations and provisions of this  _Section 10.1(b)_. If Buyer provides
written notice of a breach of

 



38  this special warranty of title in the Conveyance Documents to Seller, Seller
shall have a reasonable opportunity to cure such breach to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer. Disputes regarding the existence of a breach of the
special warranties of title contained in the Conveyance Documents or the cure
thereof shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 10.2(g)_ of this
Agreement.

 

(c) _Beneficial Ownership by CLLR_. Buyer acknowledges that as of the
Execution Date and the Closing Date, Carrizo holds record title as to certain
of the Properties for the benefit of CLLR with CLLR owning all of the
beneficial interest in such Properties. At the Closing, CLLR shall cause
Carrizo to convey to Buyer record title to those Properties as to which
Carrizo holds record title on behalf of Seller.

Section 10.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_. 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. Reasonably promptly following discovery and in any
event no later than April 25, 2012 (the " _Title Claim Date_ "), Buyer must
deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section
10.2(a)_ (collectively the " _Title Defect Notices_ " and individually a "
_Title Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert
as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Article X_. For all purposes of this
Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject in
all cases to Buyers rights pursuant to the special warranty of title in the
Conveyance Documents, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall
have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a
Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the
Title Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in
writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defects,
(ii) the Wells, Fee Interests or Undrilled Locations affected by the Title
Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property and (iv) the amount, which estimate is non-binding, by
which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defects. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Seller written notice (which shall not
constitute a Title Defect Notice) of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer on
a weekly basis, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Title Claim Date and will not prejudice in any way Buyers
ability to assert a Title Defect.

(b) _Seller s Right to Cure_. If Buyer provides written notice of Title
Defect, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to 120 days after the Closing Date
(the " _Cure Period_ "), to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, any Title
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.

(c) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to the rights of the parties
pursuant to _Section 13.1_, and subject to Sellers right to dispute the
existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted by Buyer,
in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance
with _Section 10.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or
before the last day of the Cure Period to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, the
parties shall mutually agree to elect one of the following remedies:

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the
Aggregate Deductible, a reduction in the Purchase Price by the Title Defect
Amount;

 



39 (ii) indemnification of Buyer by Seller against all Liability resulting
from such Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement in the form
attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit G_ , in which case the Purchase Price
shall not be reduced by the Title Defect Amount or Allocated Value with
respect to such Title Defect Property; or

(iii) retention by Seller of the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which
event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets.

 

If the parties are unable to agree on whether subsection _(i)_ , _(ii)_ or
_(iii)_ above will apply, then the parties shall be deemed to have elected
option _(i)_ ; _provided, however,_ that (A) if the Title Defect Amount is
greater than 50% of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and (B)
Buyer does not agree to accept indemnification from Seller pursuant to clause
_(ii)_ , then Seller, in its sole discretion, may elect option _(iii)_.

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Sellers special warranty of title under
the Conveyance Documents, _Section 10.2(c)_, shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers failure to have Defensible Title or
any other title matter with respect to any Well, Fee Interest, Undrilled
Location or Lease.

(e) _Title Defect Amount_. The " _Title Defect Amount_ " resulting from a
Title Defect that is not waived in writing by Buyer shall be the amount by
which the Allocated Value of the affected Title Defect Property is reduced as
a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance (other than a Permitted
Encumbrance) that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from the Title Defect Property; 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue
Interest as stated on _Exhibit A-3_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-3_ (
_provided, however_ , that an adjustment shall be made for any proportionate
decrease in Working Interest);

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance (other than a
Permitted Encumbrance) upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect

 



40  Property of a type not described above, the Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the likelihood
that the Title Defect will be asserted, the values placed upon the Title
Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary
to make a proper evaluation;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon
any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 

(f) _Title Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for (i) any individual Title Defect for which the Title
Defect Amount does not exceed $30,000 (the " _Individual Title Defect
Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect for
which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold
unless (A) the amount of the sum of (x) the Title Defect Amounts of all such
Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold, in the
aggregate, excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects
cured by Seller, and (y) the Remediation Amounts of all Environmental
Conditions, in the aggregate, excluding any individual Environmental
Condition for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold and excluding any Environmental Conditions Remediated
by Seller, exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer
shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only
with respect to such Title Defects in excess of such Aggregate Deductible;
_provided_ that the entire Title Defect Amount of Title Defects meeting the
description in clause _(x)_ above and not just the portion in excess of the
Individual Title Defect Threshold shall be counted toward determining whether
the Aggregate Deductible has been met. If Seller retains any Title Defect
Property pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)(iii)_, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and the Title
Defect Amount relating to such Title Defect Property will be counted
towards the Aggregate Deductible. The Parties agree that, subject to _Section
10.2(e)(v)_, if the same Title Defect affects more than one Well, Fee Interest
or Undrilled Location, then the Title Defect Amounts for each Well, Fee
Interest or Undrilled Location affected by such Title Defect shall be
aggregated for the purposes of determining whether the Individual Title Defect
Threshold has been met with respect to such Title Defect.

 

(g) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts prior to the end of the Cure Period.
If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by the end of the Cure Period, the
Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved
pursuant to this _Section 10.2(g)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who
shall be a title attorney with at least ten years experience in oil and gas
titles

 



41  involving properties in Texas, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller within 15 days after the end of the Cure Period, and absent such
agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the
" _Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do
not conflict with the terms of this _Section 10.2_. The Title Arbitrators
determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in
dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by
the rules set forth in this _Article X_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, _however_ ,
may not award the Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect
Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice,
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Title Arbitrators
awards are subject to the limitation on liabilities provisions set forth in
_Section 10.2(f)_. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect and Title
Defect Amounts submitted by either party and may not award damages, interest
or penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer
shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Title Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with
respect to any Title Defect Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.4_ or _Section 3.5_, then
within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer
and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount, Seller shall
pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer.
Subject to the parties rights pursuant to _Section 13.1_, the Closing shall
not be delayed on account of any arbitration hereunder and to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the parties as of the Closing, the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted therefor as of the Closing and subsequent
adjustments thereto, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or this
_Section 10.2_.

Section 10.3 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 

(a) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any material casualty to the Assets
or any portion thereof that occurs, or any condemnation proceeding commenced,
after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing Date. If prior to the
Closing Date any portion of the Assets is destroyed by Casualty Loss, then, if
the Closing occurs, Seller, at Sellers sole discretion, shall select one of
the following options which shall apply to the Casualty Losses: (i) Seller
shall cause the Assets affected by such Casualty Losses to be repaired or
restored to at least their condition prior to such Casualty Losses, at
Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may
extend after the Closing Date) or (ii) Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Buyer
all sums paid to Seller or its Affiliates by Third Parties by reason of such
Casualty Losses and shall assign to Buyer all of Sellers or its Affiliates
right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and
other rights against Third Parties arising out of the casualty.

 

(b) If after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent
domain by any Governmental Authority, the Assets or portion thereof shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing to the extent of
the interest affected by the condemnation or right of eminent domain and
the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such interest.

 



42 (c) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof after the
Execution Date, but no taking of such Asset or portion thereof occurs prior to
the Closing Date, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
nevertheless close and Seller, at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set
over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers or its Affiliates right,
title and interest (if any) in such taking, including any insurance claims,
unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties arising out of the
taking, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets threatened to be taken.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion or otherwise
(including watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any Well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and
tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets.

Section 10.4 _Preferential Rights to Purchase and Consents to Assign_.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Right to Purchase pertaining to an Asset
and the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller, promptly following the date
hereof, and, in any event, prior to the Closing, shall send to the holder of
each such right a notice, in compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable to such right. In addition, promptly following the date hereof,
and, in any event, prior to the Closing, Seller shall send to each holder of
a right to consent to assignment (excepting the holder of a right to a
Customary Post-Closing Consent) pertaining to the Assets and the transactions
contemplated hereby a notice seeking such partys consent to the
transaction contemplated hereby. In each of the above cases, prior to sending
such notices to the applicable holders thereof, Seller shall provide Buyer (i)
a copy of each such notice and (ii) a reasonable amount of time to comment on
the same. 

(b) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Right to Purchase
notifies Seller or an Affiliate of Seller that it intends to consummate the
purchase of the Asset to which its Preferential Right to Purchase applies,
that Asset shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer to the
extent of the interest affected by the Preferential Right to Purchase, and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the relevant
Asset (or portion thereof) allocable to such interest. Seller shall be
entitled to all proceeds paid by a party exercising a Preferential Right to
Purchase prior to the Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Right to
Purchase thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Asset covered by
such right on or before 60 days following the later of the Closing Date or the
expiration of the time for exercising such Preferential Right to Purchase,
then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten
days following receipt of such notice, such Asset from Seller, under the terms
of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Value (or portion
thereof) previously allocated to it.

(c) If a Preferential Right to Purchase burdening any Asset is not exercised,
or the time for exercising such Preferential Right to Purchase has not expired
prior to the Closing

 



43  Date, then such Asset shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed at
Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
relevant Asset. If the holder of such Preferential Right to Purchase
thereafter fails to exercise or consummate the purchase of the Asset covered
by such right on or before 120 days following the later of the Closing Date or
the time for exercising such Preferential Right to Purchase expires without
being exercised, then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase,
on or before ten days following receipt of such notice, such Asset from
Seller, under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated
Value (or portion thereof) previously allocated to it.

(d) All Assets for which Preferential Rights to Purchase have been waived, or
as to which the period to exercise such right has expired prior to the
Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement.

(e) Promptly following the date hereof, and, in any event, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents listed on _Schedule 4.4(a)_ and  _Schedule 4.4(b)_ that are required
to permit the assignment of the Assets by Seller to Buyer and the consummation
by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ ,
neither party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay any money in
order to be in compliance with the foregoing covenant.

(f) If Seller fails to obtain a consent (other than a Customary Post-Closing
Consent), which required consents are set forth on _Schedule 4.4(a)_ , prior
to the Closing, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such failed
consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer, and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded Asset
(or portion thereof). For a period of 120 days following Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to
obtain any such consent. If such consent is obtained within such period, then
Seller shall convey to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) which was excluded
from the Assets, and Buyer shall pay to Seller the Allocated Value of the
excluded Asset (or portion thereof).

ARTICLE XI

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 11.1 _Environmental Conditions_.

(a) _Assertions of Environmental Conditions_. Buyer must deliver claim notices
to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section 11.1(a)_ (collectively
the " _Environmental Condition Notices_ " and individually an " _Environmental
Condition Notice_ ") reasonably promptly following discovery and, in any
event, no later than the Environmental Claim Date, setting forth any matters
which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Conditions and
which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Conditions pursuant to this 
_Section 11.1_. For all purposes of this Agreement but subject to Buyers
remedy for a breach of Sellers representation contained in _Section 4.16_
and Sellers indemnity obligation in _Section 12.2_, Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived any Environmental Condition which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Condition by an Environmental Condition Notice received by
Seller on or before the Environmental Claim Date. To be effective,
each Environmental Condition Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a reasonably detailed

 



44  description, including, where available, supporting documentation, of the
matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) a description of
each Asset (or portion thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental
Condition, (iii) Buyers assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of
the Assets affected by the alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) an
estimate, which is non-binding, of the Remediation Amount that Buyer asserts
is attributable to such alleged Environmental Condition. Buyers calculation
of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Condition Notice
should describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the
Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental
Condition and the primary assumptions used in calculating the Remediation
Amount, including, where applicable, any standards that Buyer asserts must be
met to comply with Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to Remediate any claimed Environmental Condition on or before
the Closing Date (the " _Environmental Condition Cure Period_ "). Seller may
select and employ at its sole discretion any generally accepted remedial
technology or approach to Remediate an identified Environmental Condition.

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Conditions_. Subject to the parties rights
pursuant to _Section 13.1_, in the event that any Environmental Condition
timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 11.1(a)_ is not waived
in writing by Buyer or Remediated on or before the last day of the
Environmental Condition Cure Period, then the parties shall mutually agree to
elect one of the following remedies: 

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, a reduction of the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or determined in accordance with _Section
11.1(g)_;

(ii) assumption of responsibility by Seller for the Remediation of such
Environmental Condition; or

(iii) retention by Seller of the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Condition, together with all associated Assets, in which event
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such Asset and such associated Assets.

In the event the parties cannot agree to either  _Section 11.1(b)(i)_,
_(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , then _Section 11.1(b)(i)_ shall be the remedy for an
Environmental Condition unless the Allocated Value of such Asset is equal to
or less than the Remediation Amount asserted by Buyer, in which event
_Section 11.1(b)(iii)_ shall be the remedy for an Environmental Condition.

(c) If clause (i) above is applicable or the default remedy, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Environmental
Condition and such Environmental Condition and all Liabilities with respect
thereto shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Obligations. If clause (ii)
above is applicable, then (A) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws, taking into consideration Buyers use and
operation of the Assets, in a timely fashion for the type of Remediation
Seller elects to undertake and, upon advance written notice, Buyer hereby
grants Seller access to the affected Assets after 

 



45  the Closing Date to implement and complete such Remediation in accordance
with an access agreement mutually agreeable to the parties, and (B) there
shall be no reduction to the Purchase Price related to such Environmental
Condition. Upon completion of Remediation under clause (ii) above, Seller
shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Buyer or
its Affiliates, (1) close all bore holes from its Remediation in accordance
with recognized industry standards, (2) repair all damage done to the Assets
in connection with the Remediation, and (3) remove all equipment, tools or
other property brought onto the Assets in connection with the Remediation.
Under either clause (i) or clause (ii) above, the party performing Remediation
shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any Remediation. In
completing the Remediation, the party performing the Remediation
shall provide the other party with draft copies of all documents to be
submitted to any Governmental Authorities regarding the Remediation and shall
reasonably cooperate with the other party to incorporate comments provided by
it to the party performing the Remediation regarding such documents. In
addition, the party performing the Remediation shall promptly provide the
other party with copies of any correspondence with any Governmental Authority
regarding the Remediation and shall provide the other party with the
opportunity to participate in any meetings with any Governmental Authority
regarding the Remediation. The party performing the Remediation shall be
solely responsible for obtaining any permits or other authorizations from
any Governmental Authority associated with the Remediation. The party
performing the Remediation shall promptly remove any waste material generated
during the Remediation from the Assets. The party performing the Remediation
shall require any contractors or subcontractors entering the Assets in
connection with the Remediation to provide the other party with certificates
of insurance demonstrating coverage under Commercial General Liability,
Contractors Pollution Liability, and Errors and Omissions Liability insurance
policies in a form reasonably acceptable to the other party and naming the
other party as an additional insured.

(d) With respect to any provision of this _Article XI_ that refers to any
Remediation completed by Seller, whether before or after the Closing, Seller
will be deemed to have adequately completed the Remediation (A) upon receipt
of a certificate of approval or completion from the applicable Governmental
Authority that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to
comply with existing Laws or (B) if no certificate or approval is available
under Environmental Law or upon express written consent of Buyer, upon mutual
agreement of the parties, upon receipt of a certificate from an independent,
licensed professional engineer that the Remediation has been implemented to
the extent necessary to comply with Environmental Laws; _provided,_ if the
parties cannot agree, the issue of whether the Remediation is completed may be
resolved by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section
11.1(g)_. 

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers remedy for a breach of Sellers
representation contained in  _Section 4.16_, Sellers indemnification
obligation in _Section 12.2_, and Buyers rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 13.1_, the provisions set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_
shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Condition or other environmental matter with respect to any
Asset. The parties acknowledge and agree that information identified or
discovered by Buyer prior to the Environmental Claim Date or information
identified, discovered or developed in connection with the Remediation of a
noticed Environmental Condition shall not form the basis for a claim for a
breach of representation or warranty pursuant to  _Section 4.16_.

 



46 (f) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Condition for
which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $50,000 (" _Individual
Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
Environmental Condition for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the
Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Conditions that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any Environmental
Conditions Remediated by Seller, and (2) the Title Defect Amounts of all
Title Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any individual Title Defect for
which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and any Title Defects cured by Seller, (B) exceeds the Aggregate
Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to the portion of the
Remediation Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Deductible; _provided_ that
the entire Remediation Amount and not just the portion in excess of the
Individual Environmental Threshold shall be counted toward determining whether
the Aggregate Deductible has been met. The Parties agree that if the same
Environmental Condition affects more than one Well, Fee Interest or Undrilled
Location, then the Remediation Amounts for each Well, Fee Interest or
Undrilled Location affected by such Environmental Condition shall be
aggregated, without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Remediation Amount hereunder, for the purposes of determining whether the
Individual Environmental Threshold has been met with respect to such
Environmental Condition.

 

(g) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on all Environmental Conditions and Remediation Amounts prior to the
end of the Environmental Condition Cure Period. If Seller and Buyer are unable
to agree by the end of the Environmental Condition Cure Period, the
Environmental Conditions and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall
be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section
11.1(g)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
attorney or environmental expert with at least ten years experience in
environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in Texas, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the
Closing Date, and absent such agreement within such time period, then each
party will nominate a candidate to select the Environmental Arbitrator, and
such candidates so nominated by Buyer and Seller shall together determine the
Environmental Arbitrator within 15 days after the last candidate is nominated
and absent such determination within such time period, the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be selected by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within 20 days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Section 11.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however,
may not award the Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation
Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Condition Notice or a
lesser Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Seller and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Environmental

 



47  Arbitrators awards are subject to the limitations on liability set forth in
_Section 11.1(f)_. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental
Conditions and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the
award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount
is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 3.4_ or _Section 3.5_, then within ten days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with
respect to a Remediation Amount, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if
any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Seller, if any, and (ii)
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Subject to the parties rights pursuant to
_Section 13.1_, nothing herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be
delayed on account of any arbitration hereunder and to the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by Seller and Buyer as of the Closing, the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor as of the Closing and subsequent
adjustments thereto, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or this
_Section 11.1_. 

Section 11.2 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Buyer acknowledges that the
Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and
gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, Hazardous
Substances or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets
or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included
in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come
in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils
or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

column entitled "Seller AFE Obligations", less any amounts actually paid by
Seller pursuant to such AFE at any time prior to the Closing (the obligations
in clauses (c) and (d) of this _Section 12.2_ are collectively referred to as
the " _Retained Obligations_ ").

 

Section 12.3 _Indemnities of Buyer_. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis, and hereby defends,
indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Seller and its Affiliates,
and all of their respective owners, stockholders, partners, members,

the Asset Financial Statements (but shall relate to the inclusion, reflection
or description of such Liabilities in the Asset Financial Statements or the
failure of any such Liability to be so included, reflected or described) for
which Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this _Article XII_ or
for which a remedy is otherwise available to Buyer pursuant to _Articles X_
and _XI_.

Section 12.4 _Limitation on Liability_.

 

(a) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under _Section
12.2(a)_ (except for breaches of Fundamental Representations made by Seller
or breaches of the representations in _Section 4.17_) until and unless the
aggregate amount of all Liabilities for which Claim Notices are delivered by
Buyer exceeds the Post-Closing Deductible reduced by (i) the aggregate amount
of all Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title
Defect Threshold and that are not cured by Seller, and (ii) the aggregate
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Conditions that exceed the
Individual Environmental Threshold and that are not Remediated by Seller, and
then only to the extent such damages exceed the Post-Closing Deductible.

_Section 12.2(a)_ (except for breaches of Fundamental Representations made by
Seller or breaches of the representations in _Section 4.17_); (ii) for any
Title Defects pursuant to _Article X_ (but excluding Buyers rights pursuant
to the special warranty of title in the Conveyance Documents); or (iii) for

50 Section 12.5 _Express Negligence_. THE INDEMNIFICATION, RELEASE, ASSUMED
OBLIGATIONS AND RETAINED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES
AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS,
SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND
SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE
RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

Section 12.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, _Section 9.1(d)_, _Section 12.2_ and _Section
12.3_ contain the parties exclusive remedy against each other with respect to
breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
parties contained in this Agreement.

Section 12.7 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification
under _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 12.2_ and _Section 12.3_ shall be asserted
and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this _Article XII_ , the term " _Indemnifying Party_ ",
when used in connection with particular Liabilities, shall mean the party or
parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or parties with
respect to such Liabilities pursuant to this _Article XII_ , and the term "
_Indemnified Party_ ", when used in connection with particular Liabilities,
shall mean the party or parties having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by another party or parties pursuant to this
_Article XII_.

 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section
12.2_ or _Section 12.3_, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of its claim under this _Section 12.7_, including the specific details
of, and specific basis under this Agreement for, its claim (the " _Claim
Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a
claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a " _Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy
of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim; _provided_ that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this
_Section 12.7_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ (as applicable)
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend
against the claim.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and
during such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 



51 (d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof subject to the
remainder of this  _Section 12.7(d)_. If requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 12.7(d)_. An
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim
or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys choosing; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall not
settle a Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 90 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure, if curable, or Remediate, if applicable, the Liabilities complained
of, (ii) admit its liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim
for such Liabilities.

(g) The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Indemnified Parties is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reduced by (i) the value
of any corresponding Tax benefit created or generated and actually realized,
net of any corresponding tax costs incurred by such party covering such
Liabilities or (ii) any corresponding insurance proceeds actually realized,
net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance
underwritten by the Indemnified Parties. Each Indemnified Party agrees that
it shall pursue in good faith all claims under any applicable insurance
policies and against other Persons (including its Affiliates) that may be
responsible for any of Sellers Liabilities or Buyers Liabilities, as
applicable. The Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate
damages in respect of any claim for which such Indemnified Party, as
applicable, is seeking indemnification and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such
costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the amount thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
the rights of the Indemnified Party in respect of any insurance relating to
the Indemnifying Partys Liability, as the case may be, to the extent of any
indemnification payments made hereunder, and the Indemnified Party shall
provide all reasonably requested assistance to the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such subrogation.

 



52 (h) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
indemnification with respect to any of the Indemnified Partys Liabilities,
based on any set of facts to the extent the Purchase Price is being or has
been adjusted by reason of the same set of facts. The determination of the
dollar amount of any Liabilities shall be based solely on the actual dollar
value thereof, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and shall not take into account
any multiplier valuations, including any multiple based on earnings or other
financial condition.

 

Section 12.8 _Survival_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties in _Article IV_ and
_Article V_ (other than (i) the Fundamental Representations and the covenants
and agreements in  _Section 6.1_) shall survive the Closing until the first
anniversary of the Closing. Subject to the foregoing, the remainder of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit; provided that the
representations in  _Section 4.17_ shall only survive until the date that is
60 days following expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further
force and effect after the date of their expiration; _provided_ that there
shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date. The parties intend to shorten the
applicable statute of limitations as provided herein.

(b) The indemnities in this _Article XII_ shall terminate as of the
termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to
matters for which a Claim Notice has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party
on or before such termination date.

Section 12.9 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge
that the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be
adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with
or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As the
payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer and Seller waive any
right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

Section 12.10 _Non-Compensatory Damages_. None of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties nor Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from
Seller or Buyer, or their respective Affiliates, any punitive, special,
exemplary or consequential damages of any kind arising under or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent any such party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against
such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of Seller
Indemnified Parties, waive any right to recover punitive, special, exemplary
and consequential damages, arising in connection with or with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



53 Section 12.11 _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes_. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity
statute relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

Section 12.12 _Waiver of Trade Practices Act_.

 

(a) It is the intention of the parties that Buyers rights and remedies with
respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by the legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices-Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 et seq.
(the " _DTPA_ "). As such, Buyer hereby waives the applicability of the DTPA
to this transaction and any and all duties, rights or remedies that might be
imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied
directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in connection with other statutes.
Buyer acknowledges, represents and warrants (i) that it is purchasing the
goods and/or services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business
use, (ii) that it or its controlling entity has assets of $25,000,000 or more
according to its most recent financial statement prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, (iii) that it has knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the
merits and risks of a transaction such as this and (iv) that it is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position with Seller. In furtherance of the
foregoing,

 

WAIVER OF CONSUMER RIGHTS

BUYER WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE TEXAS DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER
PROTECTION ACT, SECTION 17.41 ET SEQ., BUSINESS and COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT
GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN
ATTORNEY OF BUYERS OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER.

 

(b) Buyer expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Buyer further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to enter into this Agreement, has
expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability of the DTPA.

 

ARTICLE XIII

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

Section 13.1 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated at any time at or prior to Closing by
mutual written agreement of the parties or by Seller or Buyer if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before July 31, 2012; _provided, however_ ,
that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to this
_Section 13.1_ if such party or its Affiliates are at such time in material
breach of any provision of this Agreement. 

 



54 Section 13.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

except for the provisions of _Section 1.1_, _Section 9.1(e)_, _Section
9.2_, _Section 12.10_ and this _Section 13.2_ and _Article XIV_ (other
than  _Section 14.1(b)_, _Section 14.5_, _Section 14.6_ and _Section

ARTICLE XIV

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 14.1 _Expenses and Taxes_.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses.

(b) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer shall be
borne by Buyer. Buyer shall (i) file all necessary Tax returns and other
documentation with respect to all sales, use, transfer and similar taxes ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and fees arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) be liable for and
either promptly reimburse Seller for, or promptly pay, any such Transfer
Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay, all federal
income taxes, state income taxes (including the Texas franchise Tax), and
other similar taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred
or imposed with respect to the ownership of the Assets through the Closing
Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay, all federal
income taxes, state income taxes (including the Texas franchise Tax), and
other similar taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred
or imposed with respect to the ownership of the Assets after the Closing Date.
Seller shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay, all Production Taxes
assessed by any Governmental Authority for any period, or portion thereof,
prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall
bear and pay, all Production Taxes assessed by any Governmental Authority for
any period, or portion thereof, that begins on or after the Effective Time
(including any "rollback" or

 



55  similar ad valorem or property Tax resulting from a change in use of
property by Buyer, regardless of the period with respect to which such
rollback or similar Tax is calculated). For purposes of this Agreement, ad
valorem, property and similar taxes (including any applicable interest or
penalties) shall be prorated at the Closing based on the ratio of the number
of days in the year prior to (for Seller) and on and after (for Buyer)
the Effective Time to the total number of days in the year as applied to the
amount of such taxes for the most recent year for which the amount of such
taxes can be finally determined at the Closing, except to the extent Seller
has paid all or a portion of such taxes to the Governmental Authority for the
current tax year prior to Closing. Seller shall pay to Buyer on demand
Sellers portion of all Production Taxes prorated to Seller under this
_Section 14.1_ but paid by Buyer to the extent not taken into account under
_Section 3.2(b)(iii)_. Buyer shall pay to Seller on demand Buyers portion of
all Production Taxes prorated to Buyer under this _Section 14.1_ but paid by
Seller to the extent not taken into account under _Section 3.2(a)(iii)_.

(c) If Buyer receives a refund of any Taxes that Seller is responsible for
hereunder, or if Seller receive a refund of any Taxes that Buyer is
responsible for hereunder, and such refund was not taken into account for
purposes of determining the Final Price under _Section 3.2_, the party
receiving such refund shall, within 30 days after receipt of such refund,
remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder.

 

Section 14.2 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 6.7_,
this Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written
consent of the other; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall have the right
prior to Closing to assign to an Affiliate the right to acquire certain of the
Assets that are held, as of the Execution Date, by Hondo, and upon such
assignment, all references to "Buyer" in this Agreement will be deemed to
include such assignee. No assignment of any rights hereunder by a party shall
relieve such party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder.

Section 14.3 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise set forth in this  _Section
14.3_, Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all press
releases or other public or private announcements issued or made prior to the
Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein,
and, except as the disclosing party may reasonably consider necessary in order
to satisfy its or its Affiliates obligations under Laws or the applicable
rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock exchange,
neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or other
publicity prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, prior to Closing Buyer shall be permitted to
disclose the terms of this transaction to any person or organization, legal or
natural, from whom Buyer is seeking, or intending to seek, finance or
investment in relation to the transaction contemplated herein, including any
professional consultant or adviser retained by such person or organization for
the purpose of evaluating such information.

Section 14.4 _Notices_. All notices and communications required or permitted
to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be (a) delivered
personally, (b) sent by bonded overnight courier, (c) mailed by U.S. Express
Mail or by certified or registered United States Mail with all postage fully
prepaid or (d) sent by facsimile transmission (provided any such facsimile
transmission is confirmed by written confirmation which may be by electronic

Any notice given in accordance herewith shall be deemed to have been given
when delivered to the addressee in person, or by courier during normal
business hours, or upon actual receipt by the addressee after such notice has
either been delivered to an overnight courier or deposited in the United
States Mail, or upon written confirmation of receipt if given by
facsimile transmission, as the case may be. The parties hereto may change the
address, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers to which such communications
are to be addressed by giving written notice to the other parties in the
manner provided in this  _Section 14.4_.

Section 14.5 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any
case within 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the name
and any variants thereof from the Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement
and, except with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage,
shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 14.6 _Further Cooperation_. After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered from time to
time, such further instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such
other actions as any party may reasonably request to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer, to perfect Buyers title thereto and to accomplish the
orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement. If any party hereto receives monies belonging to the other, such
amount shall immediately be paid over to the proper party. If an invoice or
other evidence of an obligation is received by a party, which is partially an
obligation of both Seller and Buyer, then the parties 

 



57  shall consult with each other, and each shall promptly pay its portion of
such obligation to the obligee. At Sellers sole cost and expense, Buyer
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in
connection with Sellers defense and other actions relating to or arising out
of the litigation and claims that are Retained Obligations, including upon
reasonable request by making its and its Affiliates employees engaged in the
operation of the Assets available during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice for the purposes of providing testimony, depositions,
information and other related activities relating to such litigation and
claims. At Buyers sole cost and expense, Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyers defense
and other actions relating to or arising out of any litigation and claims
that are Assumed Obligations, including upon reasonable request by making its
and its Affiliates employees that were engaged in the operation of the Assets
prior to Closing available during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice for the purposes of providing testimony, depositions,
information and other related activities relating to such litigation and
claims.

Section 14.7 _Filings and Certain Governmental Approvals_. Promptly after
Closing Buyer shall (a) record the Assignments of the Assets executed at the
Closing in all applicable real property records and (b) actively pursue the
approval of all applicable Governmental Authorities of the assignment of the
Assets to Buyer and the designation of Buyer as the operator thereof, as
applicable.

 

Section 14.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
hereto, the Assignments, Assignment and Assumption, the Deed, the Transition
Services Agreement, the Transaction Documents, and, only until Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement, collectively constitute the entire Agreement among
Seller and Buyer pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, of the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

Section 14.9 _Parties in Interest_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their
respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. No other person
shall have any right, benefit, priority, or interest hereunder or as a result
hereof or have standing to require satisfaction of the provisions hereof in
accordance with their terms. 

Section 14.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing executed by the parties hereto against whom enforcement is sought.

Section 14.11 _Waiver; Rights Cumulative_. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the party hereto waiving
compliance. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer, or
their respective officers, employees, agents or representatives, nor any
failure by Seller or Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such party
at a later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by
any party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of any breach of any other term,

 



58  covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of Seller and Buyer under
this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of
any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

Section 14.12 _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding
any conflicts of law rule or principle that might refer construction of such
provisions to the laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or the transactions contemplated
thereby (a _"Dispute_ ") shall be resolved in accordance with this _Section
14.12_. Any party may give the other party written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") of any Dispute which has not been resolved in the normal course of
business. Within 15 business days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the
receiving party shall submit to the other party a written response (the "
_Response_ "). The Dispute Notice and the Response shall each include (i) a
statement setting forth the position of the party giving such notice, a
summary of the arguments supporting such position and, if applicable, the
relief sought and (ii) the name and title of a senior manager of such party
who has authority to settle the Dispute and will be responsible for the
negotiations related to the settlement of the Dispute (the " _Senior Manager_
").

(c) Within 10 days after the delivery of the Response provided for in
_Section 14.12(b)_, the Senior Managers of both parties shall meet or
communicate by telephone at a mutually acceptable time and place, and
thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, and shall negotiate in
good faith to attempt to resolve the Dispute that is the subject of such
Dispute Notice. It is agreed between the parties that the content of any
communications pursuant to this _Section 14.12(c)_ will be and shall remain
confidential. The parties, on behalf of themselves and their attorneys, hereby
agree that they will not in any way reveal the content or terms of any such
communications to any person, firm, corporation, or entity, with
the exception that the disclosure shall not be a violation of this paragraph
where the same is required by Law or court order, or any agency or authority
having jurisdiction to require disclosure; _provided further, however_ , that
the parties may disclose the content or terms of such communications to their
attorneys, accountants, trustees, financial advisors and/or their tax related
consultants, as may be necessary in their business affairs. If such Dispute
has not been resolved within 30 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice,
then the parties may proceed to arbitration pursuant to _Section 14.12(d)_.

(d) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement, the parties
agree that any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement that
cannot be amicably settled pursuant to  _Section 14.12(c)_, shall be
determined solely and exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the
Federal Arbitration Act and using the rules of the American Arbitration
Association or any successor thereof when not in conflict with such act.
Arbitration shall take place at an appointed time and place in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. Each party shall select one impartial arbitrator, and the two so
designated shall select a third impartial arbitrator. If either party shall
fail to designate an arbitrator within 14 days after arbitration is
requested, or if the two arbitrators

 



59  shall fail to select a third arbitrator within 30 days after arbitration is
requested, then an arbitrator shall be selected by the Senior U.S. District
Judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma. Discovery shall be made pursuant
to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and completed within 45 days of
selection of the third arbitrator. Final hearing on the matter shall be had
within 60 days of the selection of the third arbitrator and a final decision
(which may include the award of reasonable attorneys fees and costs) with a
written opinion stating the reasons therefor shall be rendered within 75 days
of said date, and be final and binding, and the parties also
waive irrevocably their right to any form of appeal, review or recourse to
any state court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be
validly made. Judgment upon an award of the majority of the arbitrators shall
be binding. Judgment on the award may be entered and enforced by any court of
competent jurisdiction. In no event, may the arbitrators award damages that
have been waived by the parties under _Section 12.10_. The arbitration
process shall be kept confidential and such conduct, statements, promises,
offers, views and opinions shall not be discoverable or admissible in any
legal proceeding for any purpose, except to the extent reasonably necessary to
enforce the final decision of the arbitrators.

 

Section 14.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any party. Upon the determination that any term or provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

Section 14.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a party by facsimile
or electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

 

Section 14.15 _Parent Guaranty_.

(a) Buyer Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and punctual
payment and performance when due of all obligations of Buyer (payment and
performance) now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, including under
_Article XII_ (collectively, the " _Buyer Obligations_ ").

(b) Buyer Parent guarantees that the Buyer Obligations will be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any
Law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of Buyer with respect thereto. This
guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, present and continuing guaranty of
payment and not of collection. The liability of Buyer Parent under this 
_Section 14.15_ shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
released, discharged, diminished, impaired, reduced or otherwise affected by
the occurrence of any of the following: (i) any lack of validity, 

 



60  enforceability or genuineness of any provision of this Agreement or any
other agreement or instrument relating thereto, (ii) any change in the time,
manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
Buyer Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to
departure from this Agreement, (iii) any release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Buyer
Obligations; or (iv) the insolvency, bankruptcy, arrangement, adjustment,
composition, liquidation, disability, dissolution or lack of power, as
applicable, of Buyer Parent, (v) any payment by Buyer or Buyer Parent to
Seller being held to constitute a preference under bankruptcy or insolvency
laws or (vi) any other action taken or omitted to be taken with respect to
this Agreement, this guaranty, or the Buyer Obligations, whether or not such
action or omission prejudices Buyer Parent or increases the likelihood that
Buyer Parent shall be required to pay the Buyer Obligations pursuant to the
terms hereof, it being the unambiguous and unequivocal intention of Buyer
Parent that Buyer Parent shall be obligated to pay the Buyer Obligations when
due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, event, action, or omission
whatsoever.

(c) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 14.15_ shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of
any of the Buyer Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
Seller upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Buyer or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. Buyer Parent hereby
waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with
respect to any of the Buyer Obligations and this guaranty. Buyer Parent hereby
irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may now or hereafter
acquire against Seller that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of Buyer Parents respective obligations under this guaranty or
this Agreement, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in
any claim or remedy of Seller against Buyer, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law,
including the right to take or receive from Buyer, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or
security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be
paid to Buyer Parent in violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior
to the later of the cash payment in full of the Buyer Obligations and
all other amounts payable under this guaranty and the termination date, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Seller, shall forthwith be
paid to Buyer to be credited and applied to the Buyer Obligations and all
other amounts payable under this guaranty, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and this guaranty, or to be held as collateral for any Buyer
Obligations or other amounts payable under this guaranty thereafter arising.

 

(d) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 14.15_ shall remain in full force
and effect until the first anniversary of the Closing Date or the termination
of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if Buyer Parent has been
notified in writing of any claims with regard to Buyer Obligations prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall remain in full force and
effect until discharge or payment in full of such Buyer Obligations.

(e) Buyer Parent hereby makes the same representations set forth in _Section
5.1_, _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.3_. Except as provided in this _Section
14.15_, Buyer Parent is not making any representations, warranties or
covenants under this Agreement.

 



61 (f) Seller agrees that Buyer Parent shall have no obligation under this
Agreement except for the guaranty set forth in this _Section 14.15_.

(g) Notices to Buyer Parent shall be made in accordance with  _Section 14.4_
to the following address:
