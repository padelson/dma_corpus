(a) _Organization_. Seller  is a national banking association duly organized,
validly existing and in good  standing under the laws of the United States,
with full corporate power and  authority to conduct its business as it is now

not required to be qualified  to do business as a foreign corporation under
the laws of any state or other  jurisdiction in order to conduct its
business.

 

 

(b) _Authority_. Seller  has taken all action necessary to approve the
Transaction Documents and the  transactions contemplated thereby. Seller has
all requisite corporate  power and authority and has taken all action
necessary in order to execute,  deliver and perform its obligations under the
Transaction  Documents. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed
and  delivered and, prior to the Closing, the other Transaction Documents
will have  been, duly authorized and at Closing will be duly executed and
delivered by  Seller and, assuming due execution and delivery by Buyer,
constitute or (with  respect to the Transaction Documents other than this
Agreement) will at Closing  constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller, enforceable  in  accordance their terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting creditors' rights  generally.

 

 

(c) _No _ _Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement
nor the consummation or performance of any of the transactions  contemplated
in the Transaction Documents will, directly or indirectly (with  or  without
notice or lapse of time):

 



 

(i) breach  (A) any provision of any of the Governing Documents of Seller or
(B) any  resolution adopted by the board of directors or the shareholders
of  Seller;

 

 

(ii) give  any Governmental Authority or other Person the right to prevent

(v) result  in the imposition or creation of any Lien upon or with respect to
any of the  Assets, other than such equitable Lien as may run in favor of
Buyer as a result  of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) _Title_. Seller  owns good and transferable title to all of the Assets
free and clear of any  Liens other than those described on _Schedule 6(d)_.
Seller  warrants to Buyer that, at the time of Closing, all Assets shall be

the Lien  of  the Leases themselves, and also subject to those other Liens
described on  _Schedule 6(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Financial  Information_. The Closing Date Report will be in accordance
with  Seller's records and will accurately present the net book value of the
Leases as  of the Record Date. In preparing the Closing Date Report, Seller
will  not change its accounting practices or methodologies from those used in
the  preparation of any previous reports provided to Buyer. Since May 1, 
2007, there has been no material adverse change to the Assets or the
Business  as  a whole, or the financial conditions or operations of the
Business, except  (a)  as of the date hereof, as set forth on _Schedule

6(e)_ delivered at the  Closing.

asserted with respect to any  such  Tax, fee or other charge.

 



 

(g) _Approvals_. Other  than as set forth on _Schedule 6(g)_ , no
authorizations, approvals or  consents of, and no filings or registrations
with, any Governmental Authority  or  any other Person are necessary for the
execution, delivery or performance by  Seller of the Transaction Documents or

(h) _Leases_.

 

 

(i) No  Performing Lease as of the date hereof is, nor as of the Record Date
will be  a  Past Due Lease, a Suspended Lease, or a Lease that is subject to
any pending  repossession  action or as to which Seller has received a
notice of an event that is, or  with  notice and/or lapse of time is likely
to constitute, a material default or  of  any claim by a lessee or guarantor
of a right of offset or counterclaim (as  referenced in Section 6(h)(x) and
identified on _Schedule  6(h)(x)_ ).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Each  Lease (other than a Charged-Off Lease) is evidenced by a written
agreement,  and  there are no material understandings, agreements,
undertakings or arrangements  between any of Seller and the lessees or
transferees under any Lease which  are  not set forth therein or in a
written agreement included in the Contract File  relating to such Lease. The
entries made on Seller's system and on  the Closing Date Report with respect
to each Lease (other than a Charged-Off  Lease) are consistent with the
Contract Files relating thereto. Each  such Lease and any Contract Files
pertaining thereto shall be supplied by Seller  to Buyer as promptly as
possible but in any event at the Closing  Date.

 

 

(iii) No  payments required to be made under any Lease have been paid in
advance of the  due dates thereof except for payments reflected in the amount
of the related  Lease receivable as shown in the Records.

 

 

(iv) Seller  has not acted, or failed to act, in a manner which would
materially alter or  reduce any of its rights or benefits under any
manufacturers' or vendors' warranties or guarantees relating to property
covered by any Performing  Lease.

 

 

(v) Seller  has properly prepared and filed Financing Statements for each
Lease (other  than  a Charged-Off Lease) that was over $25,000 at the time
of origination, and  each  such Financing Statement is current.

 

 

(vi) Each  Lease (and any related guarantees) is and will continue to be
after the date  hereof a valid, binding and enforceable, non-cancelable
obligation of the lessee  thereunder (and guarantors thereof, if any) in
accordance with its terms, except  as the same may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium and other similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors  generally. Each of such lessees and any guarantor is a
bona fide  party thereto and, to the knowledge of Seller, had the requisite
legal capacity  to enter into the respective agreements to which it is a
party as of the time  it  entered into those agreements.

 

 

(vii) The  property that is the subject of each Performing Lease has been
delivered to  the  lessee thereunder, and accepted by such lessee.

 

 

(viii) Seller  has absolute, complete and indefeasible title to the property
subject to each  Performing Lease (or a duly perfected first-lien security
interest in the  property subject to such Performing Lease) and all sums due
thereunder, free  and  clear of any and all Liens or claims of any Person
(other than the lessee under  the Performing Lease itself). The supplier or
vendor of said property  has received payment in full for said property.

 

 

(ix) Seller  is not in material breach of any obligation under any of the
Performing  Leases.

 

 

(x) Other  than as set forth on _Schedule 6(h)(x)_ , Seller has received no
notice of  any event which is, or with notice and/or lapse of time is likely
to constitute,  a material default  under any Performing Lease or of any
claim by a lessee or guarantor of a right  of offset or counterclaim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(xi) None  of the Performing Leases is a Past Due Lease or has a lessee who
is or has  been  subject to an Insolvency Event. No Performing Lease that
would  otherwise be a Past Due Lease has been restructured, and no agreements
to defer,  or change the schedule of, any payments due under any Performing
Lease have  been  made within such time period.

 

 

(xii) Each  Performing Lease has a corresponding Contract File, and each
Contract File  includes proof of payment (either by copies of canceled checks
or confirmations  of wire transfers or by such other evidence, all as shall
be satisfactory to  Buyer in its sole discretion) for the Subject Equipment
underlying each  Performing Lease.

 

 

(xiii) The  descriptions of each Performing Lease set forth on _Schedule
1(a)_ are, and  on the Closing Date Report will be, properly coded with
respect to each of  the  following items of data: (a) the number of payments
remaining, (b) the  periodic payment amount, (c) the security deposit amount,
(d) the end of lease  disposition, (e) the Residual Value or the Final
Contractual  Payment.

 

 

(xiv) Except  as set forth on _Schedule 6(h)(xiv)_ , the final payment on
each Performing  Lease is a contractual obligation and not an optional
payment.

 

 

(xv) All  payment obligations by any lessee pursuant to each Performing Lease
are due  to  the Seller, and no payments are due to any third party
originator. No  Performing Lease requires any current or future payment to a
third party  originator.

 

 

It  is  understood that Buyer's acquisition of the Charged-Off Leases is on
an as-is,  where-is basis. It is further understood that the sole remedy for
any  breach of the representations and warranties with respect to any Lease
other  than a Performing Lease shall be monetary damages, and that the
aggregate amount  of all such damages shall be limited to a maximum of
$200,000 for all such  breaches.

 

 

(i) _Compliance_. Seller  operates the Business in compliance with all
applicable federal and state  statutes and all governmental regulations.
There are no existing  violations, orders, claims, citations, penalty
assessments, orders,  investigations or proceedings affecting the Assets or
the Business.

 

 

(j) _Litigation_. Except  as set forth on _Schedule 6(j)_ , there is no
action, suit or proceeding  pending or, to the knowledge of any Seller,
threatened against or affecting  the  Business or all or any portion of the
Assets, in any court or before or by  any  Governmental Authority. To the
knowledge of Seller, no event has  occurred or circumstance exists that is
reasonably likely to give rise to or  serve as a basis for the commencement
of any action, suit or proceeding  affecting the Business. Seller is not in
default with respect to any  order of any court, Governmental Authority or
agency or arbitration board or  tribunal pertaining to the Business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(k) _Assignability  of Relationships_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6(k)_
,  all of Seller's written Customer relationships with respect to the
Performing  Leases are assignable to Buyer without notice to or consent of
any  Person. Seller shall use its Best Efforts to, as promptly as 
practicable but in no event later than the Closing Date, obtain consents 
and  give notices, to the extent that any are required, in order to assign
all  such  Customer relationships to Buyer at the Closing.

 

 

 

(l) _Brokers_. Except  for The Alta Group, LLC, whose fee will be paid by
Seller out of the proceeds  of  the Contemplated Transactions, no Person is
entitled to any finder's fee,  brokerage commission or similar payment by
Seller in connection with or arising  out of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

 

(m) _No  Misstatements or Omissions_. These representations and warranties, 
the information disclosed in the schedules and exhibits hereto and the 
certificates and other documents delivered by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement,  when considered together and in light of one another, do not
contain any untrue  statement of material fact with respect to the Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities  or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements contained  herein not misleading. There is no fact of which
Seller is aware with  respect to the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or the
Business that Seller  has  not disclosed in writing to Buyer, the existence
of which would have a material  adverse effect on the Assets, considered as a
whole.

 

 

(n) _Bulk  Sales Compliance_. The sale of the Assets by Seller to Buyer 
pursuant to this Agreement will not violate any bulk transfer or any similar 
statutory provisions in effect in any applicable jurisdiction.

applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium or other

subject to  Section 12(b), this Agreement may be terminated as follows:

 

 

(i) by  Buyer if a material breach of any provision of this Agreement has
been committed  by Seller and such breach has not been waived by Buyer or,

been  committed by Buyer and such breach has not been waived by Seller or,
prior  to  notice of termination from Seller, been cured by Buyer;

 

 

(iii) by  Buyer if any condition in Section 10 has not been satisfied as of
the date  specified for Closing in the first sentence of Section 4 or if

before such date;

 

 

(iv) by  Seller if any condition in Section 11 has not been satisfied as of
the date  specified for Closing in the first sentence of Section 4 or if
satisfaction  of  such a condition  by such date is or becomes impossible
(other than through the failure of Seller  to comply with its obligations

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) by  mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

 

(vi) by  Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before July 31, 2007 (or

payable in  connection with the sale of the Assets pursuant to this
Agreement, to the extent  that such Taxes are imposed on such party by Legal
Requirements.

 

 

(b) _Payment  of Other Retained Liabilities_. If the failure to make any 
payments with respect to the Retained Liabilities will impair Buyer's use or 
enjoyment of or title to the Assets or conduct of the Business, Buyer may, 
at  any time after the Closing Date, elect to make all such payments directly
(but  shall have no obligation to do so) and Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
such  amounts.

such  reports and returns required by Legal Requirements relating to the
Business,  with respect to the period of time during which that party owned

condition, conduct, event, fact, failure to act, incident, occurrence, plan, 
practice, situation, status or transaction involving the  Business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) _Noncompetition,  Non-solicitation and Non-disparagement_.

 

 

(i) _Noncompetition_. For  a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date,
Seller shall not, other  than  through an entity with which Seller engages
in a merger or acquisition  transaction and that already includes such a
business at the time of the merger  or acquisition, anywhere in the United
States, directly or indirectly invest  in,  own, manage, operate, finance,
control, advise, render services to or guarantee  the obligations of any
Person engaged in or planning to become engaged in the  third party
origination business of equipment leases or financings of the size  and for
the equipment of the types for which Seller, as part of the Business, 
currently extends leases or financings (" _Competing  Business_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall  prevent Seller from
acquiring, being acquired by or merging with another  business that includes
equipment leasing as part of its larger  business.

 

 

(ii) _Nonsolicitation_. For  a period of five (5) years after the Closing
Date, Seller shall  not:

 

 

a. solicit  the  equipment leasing or equipment financing business of any
Person who is a  third-party vendor or broker of such business;

 

 

b. cause,  induce  or attempt to cause or induce a third-party vendor or
broker of equipment  leasing business to cease doing business with Buyer, or
in any way interfere  with its relationship with Buyer;

 

 

c. cause,  induce  or attempt to cause or induce a third-party vendor or
broker of equipment  leasing business who has referred to Seller such
business that is on the books  of the Business on the Closing Date, or was on
the books of the Business within  the year preceding the Closing Date, to
cease doing business with Buyer, or  in  any way interfere with its
relationship with Buyer; or

 

 

d. solicit  for  employment any employee of Buyer, or any Person set forth
on _Schedule  1(i)_ , or in any way interfere with the relationship between
Buyer and any of  its employees, or any Person set forth on _Schedule 1(i)_.

 

 

(iii) _Nondisparagement_. After  the Closing Date, Seller will not disparage
the Business, Buyer, Buyer's  business or any of Buyer's shareholders,
directors, officers, employees or  agents. After the Closing Date, Buyer will
not disparage Seller,  Seller's business or any of Seller's shareholders,
directors, officers,  employees or agents.

 

 

(iv) _Modification  of Covenant_. If a final judgment of a court or tribunal
of  competent jurisdiction determines that any term or provision contained
in  Section 13(e) is invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that
the  court  or tribunal will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or
geographic  area  of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases or to replace  any  invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is  valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of  the  invalid or unenforceable term or
provision. This Section 13(e)(iv)  will be enforceable as so modified  after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be  appealed. This
Section 13(e)(iv) is reasonable and necessary to  protect and preserve
Buyer's legitimate business interests and the value of the  Assets and to
prevent any unfair advantage conferred on Seller. The  parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any remedy at law for any breach  of  the
provisions of this Section 13(e)(iv) would be inadequate, and Seller hereby 
consents to the granting by any court of an injunction or other equitable 
relief, without the necessity of actual monetary loss being proved, in order 
that the breach or threatened breach of such provisions may be effectively 
restrained.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Customer  and Other Business Relationships_. After the Closing, Seller
will  cooperate with Buyer in its efforts to continue and maintain for the
benefit  of  Buyer those business relationships of Seller existing prior to
the Closing  and  relating to the Business, including relationships with
Customers, employees,  licensors, suppliers and others, and Seller will
satisfy the Retained  Liabilities in a manner that is not detrimental to any
of such  relationships. Seller will refer to Buyer all inquiries relating
to  the Leases. Neither Seller nor any of its officers, employees, agents 
or shareholders shall take any action that would tend to diminish the value 
of  the Assets after the Closing or that would interfere with the business of
Buyer  to be engaged in after the Closing. Except for any third party 
equipment leasing or equipment financing origination business in the nature 
of  the Business, nothing in this section shall require Seller to refer
business  to  Buyer or preclude Seller from doing business with, or
referring business to,  other leasing companies.

 

 

(g) _Retention  and Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall
retain  for a period of not less than five (5) years, or such longer period
as is  consistent with Buyer's record-retention policies and practices those
Records of  Seller delivered to Buyer. Buyer also shall provide Seller
reasonable  access thereto, during normal business hours and on at least five
days' prior  written notice, to enable them to prepare financial statements
or tax returns  or  deal with tax audits. After the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide  Buyer reasonable access to Records that are Excluded Assets
and pertain to  the  Business, if any, during normal business hours and on
at least five days' prior  written notice, for any reasonable business
purpose specified by Buyer in such  notice.

 

 

(h) _Access  to Premises_. Until the termination of the Interim Servicing 
Agreement, Seller shall permit Buyer to access the premises of Seller to the 
extent necessary for Buyer to exercise its rights and discharge its
obligations  under the Interim Servicing Agreement, subject to the
limitations and  restrictions stated in the Interim Servicing Agreement.

 

 

(i) _Amendments  of Financing Statements; Transfer of Motor Vehicle Title_.
Seller  shall cooperate reasonably and provide assistance to Buyer to amend
any  Financing Statements and transfer title in any motor vehicles that are
the  subject of a Lease.

 

 

(j) _Transfer  of Electronic Files_. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in
the  export of any electronic records and data files pertaining to any Leases
from  the Seller's systems to the Buyer's systems.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

(k) _Further  Assurances_. Subject to the proviso in Sections 8(d) and 9(a),
the  parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with
any  steps  required to be taken as part of their respective obligations
under this  Agreement, and shall (a) furnish upon request to each other such
further  information; (b) execute and deliver to each other such other
documents;  and (c)  do such other acts and things, all as the other party
may reasonably request  for  the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the Contemplated  Transactions. If Seller receives any payments
on, with respect to or  arising out of the Leases, Seller shall forward such
payments to Buyer promptly  and no less frequently than weekly, either by
endorsing and delivering the  check  or by depositing the check and
delivering a bank check or wire transfer in  an  equivalent amount. If Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer determines  that it is required to prepare audited
financial statements with respect  to the  Business pursuant to Regulation
S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  then Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer and provide Buyer with such information  as Buyer shall reasonably
request to enable Buyer to prepare such financial  statements. The cost of
preparing such financial statements shall be  borne entirely by Buyer, and
Buyer shall reimburse to Seller all out-of-pocket  expenses and such internal
costs as Seller reasonably allocates for its  employees' time and overhead
incurred by Seller in providing such cooperation  and information, but as to
such internal costs only to the extent that they  exceed $5,000 in the
aggregate.

 

 

 

(l) _Taxes  with Respect to Leases_. Following the Closing, if Buyer
receives  any notice of unpaid property, sales or use taxes that were due
prior to the  Closing, but are alleged to be unpaid, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller,  and  Seller shall have the right and obligation of dealing
with the taxing authority  with respect to such allegations, and the
obligation to pay such taxes  (including any interest or penalties) if and to
the extent that funds were  collected from the lessee to cover such taxes. If
and to the extent  such taxes are owing, but Seller did not collect funds
from the lessee to cover  such taxes, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in
collecting such taxes  (including any interest or penalties) from the lessee
or causing the lessee  to  pay such amounts directly to the taxing
authority. Notwithstanding  the foregoing sentence, in the event the lessee
does not pay such amounts to  the  taxing authority, Seller shall be liable
for the payment of all such amounts  owed to such taxing authority, and
Seller shall thereupon be subrogated to  the  rights of Buyer to collect
such amounts from the lessee.

 

 

(m) _Notice  to Third Parties_. As soon as practicable following the
Closing,  Buyer shall file notices in all applicable governmental
jurisdictions in which  financing statements or titles are of record with
respect to the Leases or  Subject Equipment, as to the change in ownership of
such Assets. It  is understood however, that in some instances this is the
date on which the  next  tax filings are required to be filed in such
jurisdictions.

 

 

(n) _Assignment  of Additional Leases_. If any leases or loans are funded by
Seller  in the time period from the day after the Record Date until the
Closing Date,  and such leases or loans otherwise meet all of the
requirements set forth in  this Agreement for a Lease, then Buyer shall pay
Seller 104.7643% of the Net  Investment in such Lease, and immediately upon
receipt of such payment, Seller  shall assign such lease or loan to Buyer and
such lease or loan shall become  a "Lease" for purposes of this Agreement as
if it had been listed on _Schedule  1(a)_.

 

 

(o) _Allocation  of Purchase Price_. Within thirty (30) days from the Closing
Date,  Seller and Buyer shall agree in writing on the allocation of the
Assets and  Assumed Liabilities (the " _Allocation_ "). Buyer and Seller
agree  to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 in accordance with the
agreed upon  Allocation and that no position inconsistent with the Allocation
shall be taken  by any party hereto before any Governmental Authority.

Buyer  contained in this Agreement will survive (a) until the fifth
anniversary of  the  Closing Date with respect to the representations and
warranties contained in  Sections 6 and 7, except for any representations and
warranties related to  Taxes, which shall survive until the expiration of the
relevant statute of  limitations; (b) until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date with  respect to Section 13(e); and (c) in the case of all other
representations  and  warranties and any covenant or agreement to be

anniversary hereof, except that any  representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that would otherwise terminate  in accordance with clause (c) will
continue to survive if a Claim Notice shall  have been timely given on or
prior to such termination date, until the related  claim for indemnification
has been satisfied or otherwise resolved.

 

 

15. _Indemnification_. Seller  shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its officers, directors,  employees, agents and Affiliates, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold  harmless Seller and its officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates,  from any Loss or Losses arising out of or by reason of any breach of any of  Seller's, on the one hand, and Buyer's, on the other hand, covenants,  representations and warranties set forth herein. In addition, Seller  shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its officers, directors,  employees, agents and Affiliates from any Losses arising out of the Retained  Liabilities or the Excluded Assets. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and  hold harmless Seller and its officers, directors, employees, agents and  Affiliates from any Losses arising out of the Assumed Liabilities or Assets,  arising out of events occurring after the date hereof.

 

 

16. _Method  of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any  indemnified party hereunder will be asserted and resolved as  follows:

 

 

(a) In  the event of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall
deliver written  notification thereof to the indemnifying party with
reasonable promptness,  enclosing a copy of all papers served, if any, and
specifying the nature of  the  Third Party Claim, together with the amount
or, if not then reasonably  ascertainable, the estimated amount, determined
in good faith, of the Third  Party Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "). The
indemnifying party will  notify the indemnified party as soon as practicable,
but in any case within  30  days of receipt of a Claim Notice (the "
_Dispute Period_ "), whether the  indemnifying party disputes its liability
to the indemnified party and whether  the indemnifying party desires, at its
sole cost and expense, to defend the  indemnified party against such Third
Party Claim.

 

 

(b) If  the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the
Dispute Period  that the indemnifying party desires to defend the indemnified
party with respect  to the Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party
will have the right to  defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, at the  sole cost and expense of the indemnifying party,
such Third Party Claim by  all  appropriate proceedings, which proceedings

(c) If  the indemnifying party fails to notify the indemnified party within
the Dispute  Period that the indemnifying party desires to defend the Third
Party Claim,  or  if the indemnifying party gives such notice but fails to
prosecute vigorously  and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, or if
the indemnifying party  fails to give any notice whatsoever within the
Dispute Period, then the  indemnified party will have the right to defend, at

party. If  the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party that it does
not dispute  the claim described in such Claim Notice or fails to notify the
indemnified  party within the Dispute Period whether the indemnifying party
disputes the  claim, the Loss in the amount specified in the Claim Notice
will be conclusively  deemed a liability of the indemnifying party and the
indemnifying party shall  pay the amount of such Loss to the indemnified
party on demand. If  the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability
with respect to such  claim, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party

not resolved through  negotiations within a reasonable period of time, such
dispute shall be resolved  by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

matter  hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and 
understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied, oral or
written,  except as contained herein. This Agreement may not be changed
orally  but only by an agreement in writing, duly executed by or on behalf of
the party  or parties against whom enforcement of any waiver, change,

agreement entered into pursuant  hereto is contrary to, prohibited by or
deemed invalid under applicable law  or  regulation, such provision shall be
inapplicable and deemed omitted to the  extent so contrary, prohibited or
invalid, but the remainder hereof shall not  be  invalidated thereby and
shall be given full force and effect so far as  possible. If any provision of
this Agreement may be construed in two  or more ways, one of which would
render the provision invalid or otherwise  voidable or unenforceable another
of which would render the provision valid  and  enforceable, such provision

21

reference only and shall  not be considered in the interpretation of the
provisions hereof.

is a negotiated agreement, and that in no event shall the terms hereof be 
construed against either party on the basis that such party, or its counsel, 
drafted this Agreement.

and  accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will  each
pay one-half of the HSR Act filing fee.

 

 

(h) _Knowledge_. Certain  of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement are made "to the  knowledge" of Seller. Such phrase shall mean
either (i) the actual  knowledge of any individual set forth on _Schedule
18(h)_ ; or (ii) any  knowledge which such persons should have known had they

any or all of its rights and interests  hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates and (b) designate one or more of  its  Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases  Buyer nonetheless will
