Section 1.5   _Assumption and Assignment of Contracts_. __

__(a) Sellers shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume, the Closing
Assumed Contracts at the Closing pursuant to the Sale Order, subject to the
other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. Buyer shall pay all Cure Costs
in respect of the Closing Assumed Contracts and the Additional Assumed
Contracts, which shall not be the obligation, liability or responsibility of
Sellers. Buyer shall provide adequate assurances of any future performance in
connection with the assignment and assumption of the Closing Assumed
Contracts at Closing or the effective date of such assignment and assumption
of an Additional Assumed Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, all Assumed
Cure Costs, other than Cure Costs associated with "Assumed" Previously
Omitted Contracts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(o)_, shall be the
obligation, liability and responsibility of Buyer. For the purposes hereof,
references in this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ to the assumption and assignment of
the Closing Assumed Contracts and the Additional Assumed Contracts shall only
include Contracts to which one or more of the Debtors is a counterparty.

 

(b) The Sale Order shall provide for the assumption by the applicable
Seller party thereto, and the assignment to the extent legally capable of
being assigned by such Seller to Buyer, of (i) each Closing Assumed Contract
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code on the terms and conditions set
forth in the remainder of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and (ii) each Additional
Assumed Contract pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code on the terms
and conditions set forth in the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

 



-11- 

    

(c) Sellers have filed with the Bankruptcy Court as of July 16, 2020 a
notice (as supplemented to the date hereof, the " _Notice of Potential
Assignment_ ") in the form approved by the Contract Procedures Order and
served such Notice of Potential Assignment by first-class mail on all non-
Seller counterparties to those certain executory Contracts and unexpired
leases related to the Business or the Transferred Assets to which one or more
Sellers or their respective Affiliates are party that Sellers may wish to
assume and assign in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(each, an " _Identified Contract_ "). During the period following the date
hereof to the Closing Date, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, designate (or
remove the designation of) any Identified Contract for rejection effective on
or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (such Identified
Contracts, the " _Rejected Identified Contracts_ "). The Rejected Identified
Contracts as of the date hereof are set forth on _Schedule 1.5(c)_ , which
schedule shall be (and shall be deemed) modified or supplemented to reflect
additions or removals, as applicable, of Identified Contracts that are
designed for rejection as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ (the "
_Rejected Contracts Schedule_ "). Within one calendar day after the conclusion
or cancellation of the Auction or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court, and serve by first-
class mail on non-Seller counterparties, a notice in the form approved by the
Contract Procedures Order reflecting SellersÂ’ proposed assignment and
assumption of the Closing Assumed Contracts. At the Closing, Sellers shall
assume and assign to Buyer the Closing Assumed Contracts, in each case,
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order, subject to
provision by Buyer of adequate assurance and payment of Cure Costs as may be
required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to the terms of
the Contract Procedures Order or the Sale Order, as the case may be, Sellers
shall assume and assign to Buyer the Additional Assumed Contracts, in each
case, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order,
subject to provision by Buyer of adequate assurance and payment of Cure Costs
as may be required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(d) From time to time following the date hereof (and not later than 45
days after the Closing Date), Buyer may, subject to the terms of the Contract
Procedures Order, (i) designate additional Identified Contracts or any other
executory contracts or unexpired leases that Buyer wishes to assume in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby as "Additional Assumed
Contracts" by providing written notice to Sellers in the form of an updated
Additional Assumed Contracts Schedule;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , (A) that
Additional Assumed Contracts cannot include a Material Publisher Contract, and
(B) that a Material Publisher Contract cannot be removed from the Closing
Assumed Contracts list, subject to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(d)_, and (ii)
designate additional Identified Contracts or any other executory Contracts or
unexpired leases that Buyer wishes to reject in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby as "Additional Rejected Contracts" by
providing written notice to Sellers in the form of an updated Rejected
Contracts Schedule. Such notice must be received by Sellers no later than 45
days after the Closing Date (the " _Designation Deadline_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if as of the Closing
Date, any Closing Assumed Contract (other than any Material Publisher Contract
included on the Closing Assumed Contracts list) is the subject of an
objection as to the amount of the Cure Costs required for the Sellers to
assume and assign such contract to the Buyer, or other objection as to the
assumption and assignability of such contract, and such objection has not been
resolved to the satisfaction of the Buyer prior to or after the Closing Date,

 



-12- 

    

 Buyer reserves the right to remove such contract from the Closing Assumed
Contracts list before or after the Closing Date such that such contract shall
not be considered assumed and assigned to the Buyer hereunder.

(e) If, following service of the notice of the Additional Assumed
Contracts, the Buyer identifies additional Identified Contracts or any other
executory Contracts and unexpired leases for assumption and assignment in
connection with the sale, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a
further assumption notice (a " _Further Assignment Notice_ ") by first-class
mail in the form approved by the Contract Procedures Order on all non-Seller
counterparties to all Additional Assumed Contracts not previously noticed by
Sellers prior to the date of this Agreement, and provide a copy of the same to
Buyer. Following filing of the Further Assignment Notice, Sellers shall assume
and assign to Buyer the Additional Assumed Contracts on such date as
specified in such Further Assignment Notice; _provided_ that no such
designation date with respect to such Additional Assumed Contract shall be
later than the 45th day following the Closing Date. The assignment of the
Additional Assumed Contracts shall be pursuant to an order providing for the
assumption by the applicable Seller party thereto, and the assignment to the
extent legally capable of being assigned by such Seller to Buyer, of each of
the Additional Assumed Contracts pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code on the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_,
subject to provision by Buyer of adequate assurance and payment of Cure Costs
as may be required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if Buyer has not provided Sellers an updated
Additional Assumed Contracts Schedule to assume any additional Identified
Contracts or other executory contracts or unexpired leases in accordance with
the foregoing, then such Identified Contract or other executory contract or
unexpired lease shall, together with the Rejected Identified Contracts and
other executory Contracts or unexpired leases set forth on the
Rejected Contracts Schedule (as may be amended, updated or modified in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_) be deemed to be an Excluded
Contract and may be rejected by any Seller party thereto after the expiration
of the Designation Deadline, (y) no prepetition Cure Cost shall be due or
payable with respect to any executory contract or unexpired lease until the
assumption thereof and (z) each Identified Contract or other executory
contract or unexpired lease that becomes an Additional Assumed Contract
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(e)_ shall concurrently be deemed to have
become a Transferred Asset.

 

(f) Solely to the extent required by the Contract Procedures Order, if any
Material Publisher Contract (as defined in the Contract Procedures Order) is
not identified as a Closing Assumed Contract, absent consent of the Contract
counterparty, it may not be included later in a Further Assignment Notice and
such Contract counterparty shall have three months from the entry of an order
approving the rejection of such Material Publisher Contract (or such longer
time as reasonably necessary to remove such Contract counterpartyÂ’s goods or
property from the SellersÂ’ premises) (such period, the " _Wind-Down Period_
") to arrange for the orderly removal of any goods or other property of such
Contract counterparty in the SellersÂ’ or, following the Closing, BuyerÂ’s
possession and/or control that are the subject of consignment and/or bailment
(or similar) arrangements, contracts and/or agreements, including print-and-
hold books, finished and semi-finished products, supplied paper and supplied
consigned paper. Any such orderly removal following the Closing shall be
arranged in cooperation with Buyer and shall take place in such reasonable
manner as to not interfere with the normal operations of Buyer or its
Affiliates. Following the Closing, Buyer agrees to perform any warehousing
and fulfillment obligations under such Material Publisher Contract during the
Wind-Down Period or such other wind-down period set forth in the Identified
Contracts set forth on  _Schedule 1.5(f)_, during which period the
counterparty to such Contract shall pay Buyer for such services pursuant to
the terms of thereof.

 



-13- 

    

(g) Following the Closing, if the Consignment Agreement is not identified
as a Closing Assumed Contract, Buyer agrees to purchase, on the terms set
forth in the Consignment Agreement, on or prior to the earlier of (i) 60 days
following the Closing, or (ii) 60 days from the entry of an order approving
the rejection of such Consignment Agreement, (x) all Products (as defined in
the Consignment Agreement) held at ConsigneeÂ’s (as defined in the Consignment
Agreement) facilities and all Products ordered but not yet delivered to
ConsigneeÂ’s facilities, as such Products and orders exist as of the Closing
or the entry of an order approving rejection, as applicable, and (y) any
Products ordered by Consignee during such 60-day period whether or not
delivered by the end of such 60-day period.

(h) With respect to any Identified Contract that was subject to a Notice
of Potential Assignment prior to the date of this Agreement that is not a
Closing Assumed Contract, if following the Closing Date, Sellers incur any
direct incremental administrative expenses allowed pursuant to Section 503(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code associated with its continuance of such Identified
Contract during the period between the Closing Date and the earlier of (x) the
date such Identified Contract is either assumed and assigned to Buyer or
rejected and (y) the Designation Deadline, then Buyer shall, within 60 days
following the Closing Date, reimburse Sellers for such incremental expenses
(other than expenses caused as a result of SellerÂ’s breach of such
executory contract or unexpired lease).

(i) As part of the motion with respect to the Contract Procedures Order (or
as necessary in one or more separate motions), Sellers shall request that, by
virtue of any Seller providing seven daysÂ’ prior notice of its intent to
assume and assign any Closing Assumed Contract or Additional Assumed Contract,
the Bankruptcy Court deem any non-debtor party to such Closing Assumed
Contract or Additional Assumed Contract that does not file an objection with
the Bankruptcy Court during such notice period to have given any
Necessary Consent to the assumption of the Closing Assumed Contract or
Additional Assumed Contract by the relevant Seller and assignment to Buyer.

 

(j) At BuyerÂ’s request, and at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and expense, Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer to allow
Buyer to enter into an amendment of any Closing Assumed Contract or Additional
Assumed Contract upon assumption of such Closing Assumed Contract or
Additional Assumed Contract by Buyer (and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer in negotiations with
the counterparties thereof); _provided_ that (i) in no event shall any such
amendments be effective prior to the Closing and (ii) Sellers shall not be
required to enter into any such amendment if such amendment would result in
the incurrence of any additional Liability that would not have existed but for
such amendment by Sellers that is not otherwise paid by Buyer at the time of
the assumption by Sellers of such Closing Assumed Contract or Additional
Assumed Contract. Buyer shall consult with Sellers and the professional
advisors to the Ad Hoc Group in good faith prior to agreeing to pay any Cure
Costs with respect to any Closing Assumed Contract or Additional Assumed
Contract in an amount greater than the applicable amount included on any
Notice of Potential Assignment.

 



-14- 

    

(k) Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
one or more orders of the Bankruptcy Court (which may be the Sale Order),
which order(s) shall be in form and substance acceptable to Buyer, and shall
reflect the terms and conditions set forth herein, to assume and assign the
Closing Assumed Contracts and the Additional Assumed Contracts to Buyer on
the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and the Contract Procedures
Order.

 

(l) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(m)_, to the extent that there is (i) an
objection to the assignment and assumption of any Closing Assumed Contract
outstanding at the Closing Date, (ii) an objection to the assignment and
assumption of any Additional Assumed Contract on or prior to the seventh day
after the Further Assignment Notice is served or (iii) any Necessary Consent
that is required to assume and assign to Buyer any Closing Assumed Contract or
Additional Assumed Contract is not obtained by the Closing Date, each Seller
shall, with respect to each such Seller Contract, from and after the Closing
and until the earliest to occur of (A) the date on which such objection is
resolved or such applicable Necessary Consent is obtained, and (B) the date on
which such Seller Contract is deemed rejected under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, use commercially reasonable efforts during the term of such
Seller Contract (and to the extent the term of such Seller Contract ends prior
to the earlier of clauses (A) or (B) above) to (1) provide to Buyer the
benefits under such Seller Contract ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that Buyer
shall be solely responsible for the obligations under such Seller Contract),
(2) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement, including holding
such Seller Contract in trust for Buyer pending resolution of such objection
or receipt of the Necessary Consent, designed to provide such benefits to
Buyer, and (3) enforce for the account of Buyer any rights of such Seller
under such Seller Contract, including the right to elect to terminate such
Seller Contract in accordance with the terms thereof upon the written
direction of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall not be obligated to take any action that breaches,
violates or results in default under the terms of any Seller Contract. Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in order to enable Sellers to provide
to Buyer the benefits contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(l)_.

(m) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for any Government Contract
(which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_), a Seller Contract shall
not be a Closing Assumed Contract or Additional Assumed Contract hereunder and
shall not be assigned to, or assumed by, Buyer to the extent that such Seller
Contract is (i) deemed rejected under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or
(ii) the subject of an objection to assignment or assumption or requires,
under applicable non-bankruptcy Law, Necessary Consent of any Governmental
Entity or other third party (other than, and in addition to, that of the
Bankruptcy Court) in order to permit the assumption and assignment by
the applicable Seller to Buyer of such Seller Contract pursuant to Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and such objection has not been resolved or such
Necessary Consent has not been obtained prior to the 60th day following the
Closing (as such 60-day period may be extended by mutual agreement of Buyer
and Sellers); _provided_ that any Closing Assumed Contract or Additional
Assumed Contract that is the subject of an objection with respect solely to
the amount of the Cure Cost may be assumed and assigned prior to the
resolution of such objection.

(n) If prior to or within 180 days following the Closing, it is discovered
that a Contract should have been listed on _the Notice of Potential
Assignment_ as an Identified Contract but was not so listed and has not been
rejected by Sellers (any such Contract, a " _Previously Omitted Contract_ "),
Sellers or Buyer shall, immediately following the discovery thereof (but in no
event later than two Business Days following the discovery thereof), notify
the other Party in writing of 

 



-15- 

    

 such Previously Omitted Contract and all Cure Costs (if any) for such
Previously Omitted Contract. Buyer shall thereafter deliver written notice to
Sellers, no later than five Business Days following notification of such
Previously Omitted Contract, designating such Previously Omitted Contract as
"Assumed" or "Rejected" (a " _Previously Omitted Contract Designation_ "). A
Previously Omitted Contract designated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.5(n)_ as "Rejected," or with respect to which Buyer fails to deliver a
Previously Omitted Contract Designation, shall be deemed an Excluded Contract
and added to the Rejected Contracts Schedule.

(o) If Buyer designates a Previously Omitted Contract as "Assumed"
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(n)_, (i) such Previously Omitted
Contract shall be added to the Additional Assumed Contracts Schedule and
deemed to be an "Additional Assumed Contract" for all purposes hereunder,
and (ii) Sellers shall serve a notice (the " _Previously Omitted Contract
Notice_ ") on the counterparties to such Previously Omitted Contract notifying
such counterparties of the Cure Costs with respect to such Previously
Omitted Contract and SellersÂ’ intention to assume and assign such Previously
Omitted Contract in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(o)_. The
Previously Omitted Contract Notice shall provide the counterparties to such
Previously Omitted Contract with seven calendar days to object, in writing to
Sellers and Buyer, to the Cure Costs or the assumption of its Contract. If the
counterparties, Sellers and Buyer are unable to reach a consensual resolution
with respect to the objection, Sellers will seek an expedited hearing before
the Bankruptcy Court to determine the Cure Costs and approve the assumption.
If no objection is served on Sellers and Buyer, Sellers shall obtain an order
of the Bankruptcy Court fixing the Cure Costs and approving the assumption of
the Previously Omitted Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall be
responsible for all Cure Costs relating to such "Assumed" Previously Omitted
Contracts and for any Liabilities relating to such "Assumed" Previously
Omitted Contracts arising prior to the assumption thereof by Buyer.

 

Section 1.6 _Non-Assignment of Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer and
will not effect the Transfer of any Transferred Asset (including any Closing
Assumed Contract or Additional Assumed Contract) or Transferred Interests if
(i) (A) prohibited by applicable Law, (B) an attempted Transfer thereof would
be reasonably likely to subject Buyer, its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective Representatives to civil or criminal Liability or (C) an attempted
Transfer thereof, without the approval, authorization, consent or waiver of,
or granting or issuance of any license or permit by, any third party thereto
(each such action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "), would constitute a breach,
default or violation thereof or of any Law or Order or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Buyer, any Buyer Designee, or any Transferred Entity
(including relative to the rights of the assigning party prior to such
assignment) or (ii) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an Order approving
such Transfer. In the event such Transfer is subject to such Necessary
Consent being obtained, Sellers and Buyer will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents with respect to any such
Transferred Asset (including any Closing Assumed Contract, IT Assumed
Contract or Additional Assumed Contract) or the Transferred Interests or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the Transfer thereof to
Buyer, as Buyer may reasonably request, including obtaining the Necessary
Consents set forth on _Schedule 1.6(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that none
of Sellers, Buyer, Buyer Designees or any Transferred Entities will be
obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom
approval,

 



-16- 

    

 authorization, consent or waiver is requested (except to the extent such
consideration is included in Assumed Expenses; _provided_ , that Buyer shall
consult with Sellers and the professional advisors to the Ad Hoc Group with
respect to any material amount that would be an Assumed Expense). If such
Necessary Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted Transfer thereof would
give rise to any of the circumstances described in  _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ or
_(ii)_ of the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, be ineffective
or adversely affect the rights of Buyer to such Transferred Asset following
the Closing, (x) Sellers and Buyer will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, (1) use commercially reasonable efforts (including cooperating
with one another to obtain such Necessary Consents, to the extent feasible) as
may be necessary so that Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the
Liabilities and obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, (2)
complete any such assignments or transfers as soon as reasonably practicable
and (3) upon receipt of any applicable Necessary Consents, transfer or assign
the applicable Transferred Asset and/or the Transferred Interests to Buyer for
no additional consideration, and (y) Sellers will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer in good faith without further
consideration in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Sellers
intended to provide Buyer with the benefit of any such Transferred Assets or
Transferred Interests at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and expense, in each case, for a
period of 180 days following the Closing Date.

(b) _Assignment of Government Contracts and Government Bids_.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to render all reasonably necessary assistance
to the other Party, and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party, in
pursuing and obtaining the recognition of the Buyer as the successor in
interest to any Seller under any Current Government Contract or Current
Government Bid that is a Transferred Asset, including preparing and submitting
requests and entering into agreements as may be necessary to obtain Necessary
Consents and achieve such recognition of the Buyer.

 

(ii) With respect to each Prime U.S. Government Contract that is a
Transferred Asset, the Parties agree to enter into a novation agreement (a "
_Novation Agreement_ "), which shall comply in all material respects with the
requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 42 and shall in form and
substance be reasonably satisfactory to LSC, Buyer, and the U.S. Government.
Each Novation Agreement shall, upon U.S. Government approval and execution,
Transfer to Buyer all of the SellersÂ’ right, title and interest in and to such
Prime U.S. Government Contract. Nothing in this Agreement nor any submitted
Novation Agreement shall waive BuyerÂ’s right to assert any additional
exceptions to the Anti-Assignment of Contracts Act (41 U.S.C. Â§ 6305).

 

(iii) Promptly following the Closing, with respect to each Current
Government Contract that is a Transferred Asset, the Parties hereby agree to
designate Buyer as the SellersÂ’ agent thereunder for all purposes such that,
to the maximum extent permitted by any applicable Law, Buyer shall assume,
agree to be bound by, and undertake to perform the terms and conditions
contained in, such Government Contract as if Buyer were the original party
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be deemed to amend
the terms of such Government Contract. The appointment of Buyer as agent with
respect to each Government Contract shall be effective and binding upon
Closing and shall

 



-17- 

    

 remain in full force and effect with respect to such Government Contract
until (x) terminated by a Novation Agreement (or other agreement required by a
Governmental Entity), at which point such Government Contract shall be
assigned to and assumed by Buyer, or (y) terminated by mutual written
agreement of the Parties. In the event that any Government Contract that is a
Transferred Asset does not become subject to a Novation Agreement (or other
agreement required by a Governmental Entity), Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate reasonably in good faith to, as promptly as practicable, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and at the sole expense of Buyer, enter
into a mutually acceptable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated
with such Government Contract in accordance with this Agreement for the full
duration of such Government Contract. To that end, Sellers agree to cooperate
and to not frustrate BuyerÂ’s performance of any such Government Contract, and
to perform any contract obligations that can be performed only by Sellers
until each Governmental Entity approves or disapproves of each Novation
Agreement or other request to Transfer any such Government Contract. For the
avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise required by any applicable Law, the
Parties agree, in the case of a Government Contract that is the subject of an
arrangement described in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_ to which Sellers and
Buyer are parties (x) to treat, for applicable Tax purposes, (A) Sellers as
the agent of Buyer and (B) Buyer as the owners of such Transferred Asset, and
(y) not to take any position that is inconsistent with such treatment.

 

(iv) To the extent permitted by any applicable Law, following the Closing
and until each Governmental Entity approves or disapproves of each Novation
Agreement or other request to Transfer any such Government Contract, Sellers
and Buyer shall promptly inform the other Party of any substantive
communications with any Governmental Entity regarding any Government Contract
and Government Bid. In the event either Party has any substantive
communications with any Governmental Entity regarding any Government Contract
or Government Bid subject to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, such Party will
include the other Party in all such communications to the extent permitted by
any applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that circumstances may dictate
that from time to time a Governmental Entity may initiate communications with
a Party in such a manner that does not permit such Party to include the other
Party from the outset, in which case such Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to limit the amount of substantive communication with such
Governmental Entity until the other Party can participate and shall update
the other Party promptly. Sellers and Buyer shall promptly forward to the
other Party any written communications from a Governmental Entity, as
applicable to, referring to or relating to any Government Contract or
Government Bid subject to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)(iv)_.

 

Section 1.7 _Wrong Pocket_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, if at any
time after the Closing (i) Buyer or a Buyer Designee holds, directly or
indirectly, any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or (ii) any Seller
holds, directly or indirectly, any Transferred Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, Buyer or the applicable Seller will promptly Transfer (or cause
to be Transferred) such assets or assume (or cause to be assumed) such
Liabilities to or from (as the case may be) the other Party, without further
consideration from the other Party. Prior to any such transfer, the Party
receiving or possessing any such asset will hold it in trust for such other
Party. If at any time after the Closing, any Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives any payments in respect of the Transferred 

 



-18- 

    

 Assets, such Seller shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, promptly remit
such payments to Buyer (or any Buyer Designee). If at any time after the
Closing, Buyer (or any Buyer Designee) receives any payments in respect of
the Excluded Assets, Buyer (or such Buyer Designee) shall promptly remit such
payments to Sellers.

 

Section 1.8 _Intracompany Arrangements_.

 

(a) Each of Buyer and Sellers agrees that, immediately prior to the Closing,
any and all Intracompany Payables and Intracompany Receivables between any of
the Transferred Entities, on the one hand, and any Seller or Affiliate thereof
(other than the Transferred Entities), on the other hand, in each case, other
than any Intracompany Loan Receivables and Intracompany Loan Payables,
shall be fully settled or otherwise deemed cancelled effective as of
immediately prior to the Closing, without any Liability to any Transferred
Entity, nor to Buyer or any Buyer Designee; _provided_ that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_ shall require any Seller to terminate, settle or cancel
any Contract, including any Intracompany Payable or Intracompany Receivable,
exclusively between or among the Transferred Entities.

 

(b) Each of Buyer and Sellers agrees that, immediately prior to the
Closing, any and all Contracts between any of the Transferred Entities, on
the one hand, and any Seller or Affiliate thereof (other than the Transferred
Entities), on the other hand, except for (i) any Contracts relating to the
Intracompany Loan Receivables or the Intracompany Loan Payables or (ii) the
Transaction Documents, shall be terminated and be of no further force or
effect and all obligations thereunder shall be fully satisfied and
extinguished, notwithstanding any terms thereof to the contrary.

 

(c) No additional consideration shall be payable by, and no additional
amounts shall be owed by, Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, as of
the Closing, the Transferred Entities, to Sellers or any of their Affiliates
in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.8_. Following the Closing, neither the Buyer, the Buyer Designees, nor the
Transferred Entities shall have any Liability with respect to any transactions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether
any Intracompany Loan Taxes may be incurred in connection with the actions set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_. Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take any actions reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to the
distribution and/or cancellation of the Intracompany Payables, including those
set forth on _Schedule 1.8(d)_ , which are owed to Print LSC Communications,
S. de R.L. de C.V by LSC Communications US, LLC and the Intercompany Loan
Agreement executed by and between LSC Communications US, LLC, as borrower, and
LSC Communications Canada Corporation, as lender, dated October 28, 2019, for
CAD $10,000,000.

 

Section 1.9 _Further Conveyances and Assurances_. From time to time
following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other
instruments, and will take such further actions, as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to assure to Buyer, its designees, successors or
assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies,
powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer under this
Agreement and to assure fully to each Seller and its respective Affiliates
and their respective successors and assigns, the assumption of the Liabilities
and obligations intended to be assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, and to
otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 1.10 _Bid Protections_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, (i) if this Agreement is
terminated other than pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, and (ii) at the time of such
termination, Buyer is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then Sellers will pay the
Expense Reimbursement Amount to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, within three
Business Days following such termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, (i) if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ and (ii) at the time of such
termination, Buyer is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then Sellers will pay the Break-
Up Fee to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds, without
further order of the Bankruptcy Court, concurrently with the consummation of
any Competing Transaction and first from the proceeds of such Competing
Transaction, which shall be in addition to any payment required by  _Section_
__ _ 1.10(a)_.

(c) The Expense Reimbursement Amount and the Break-Up Fee shall, pursuant
to the Bid Procedures Order, constitute allowed administrative expenses of
SellersÂ’ estates under Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.10_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the other
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the Parties further
acknowledges that the payment by Sellers of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement Amount is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Buyer, together with any additional
damages to which Buyer may be entitled hereunder, in the circumstances in
which such Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount is payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. BuyerÂ’s
receipt in full of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount
shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Buyer against Sellers, and
Sellers shall have no further liability or obligation, under this
Agreement or relating to or arising out of any such breach of this Agreement
or failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall Buyer be
permitted or entitled to receive both (i) the remedy of specific performance
to cause the Closing and (ii) the payment of the Break-Up Fee and/or the
Expense Reimbursement Amount.

 



-20- 

    

Section 1.11 _Pension Plan_. Buyer shall assume the Pension Plan at
the Closing, _provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to assume the Pension
Plan at the Closing if (a) the Debtors, the Committee and the Requisite Junior
Secured Creditors have failed to enter into an Acceptable Stipulation prior
to the Sale Hearing and (b) Buyer delivers to Sellers prior to the Closing a
written instrument declining to assume the Pension Plan, which written
instrument has been signed by Buyer and approved by the Required Supporting
Lenders. __

_Section_ __ _ 1.12_ ___Buyer Designees_. The Buyer shall be entitled to
designate, in accordance with the terms and subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_, one or more Affiliates of Buyer to (i)
purchase specified Transferred Assets; (ii) assume specified Assumed
Liabilities; (iii) purchase the Transferred Interests and/or (iv) employ
Continuing Employees, in each case, as of the Closing Date (any Person that
shall be properly designated by Buyer in accordance with this clause, a "
_Buyer Designee_ "); _it_ _being_ _understood_ and agreed, however, that any
such right of Buyer to designate a Buyer Designee is conditioned upon such
Buyer Designee being able to perform the applicable covenants under this
Agreement and, as applicable, any other Transaction Document to which Buyer is
party and demonstrate satisfaction of the requirements of Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code (to the extent applicable). As soon as reasonably practicable
and in no event later than three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Buyer
shall make any such designations of Buyer Designees by way of a written notice
to be delivered to the Sellers. No such designation shall relieve Buyer or
any Guarantor of any of its obligations hereunder and any breach hereof by a
Buyer Designee shall be deemed a breach by Buyer. Buyer and Buyer Designees
shall be jointly and severally liable for any obligations of Buyer and such
Buyer Designees hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, all Buyer Designees appointed in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ shall be included in the definition
of "Buyer" _mutatis mutandis_ for all purposes under this Agreement and all
such Buyer Designees shall be deemed to have made all of the representations
and warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

 Section 2.7 _Adjustment_ _; Holdback_.

(a) Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, at least five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, a written statement (the " _Seller Closing
Statement_ "), in reasonable detail, setting forth: (i) an estimated
consolidated balance sheet of the Business as of the Reference Time, and (ii)
the SellersÂ’ good faith estimates, each as of the Reference Time, of (v) Net
Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (w) the Assumed
Expenses Amount (" _Estimated Assumed Expenses Amount_ "), and (x) the Seller
Tax Amount (" _Estimated Seller Tax Amount_ "), as well as the calculation of
the Estimated Cash Consideration and Estimated Cash Consideration Cap and, if
applicable, the Deficiency Amount, the Estate Holdback Amount and the Maximum
Estate Holdback Amount. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
appropriately address any

 



-25- 

    

 comments or questions that Buyer may have regarding such Seller Closing
Statement; _provided_ that in the event of any good faith dispute regarding
any such comments of Buyer, Sellers shall have no obligation to reflect any
such comments in the Seller Closing Statement.

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to LSC a
written statement (the " _Buyer Closing Statement_ "), setting forth its good
faith calculations of (i) Net Working Capital, (ii) Assumed Expenses, and
(iii) Seller Tax Amount, together with reasonable supporting detail with
respect to BuyerÂ’s calculations thereof. Buyer shall (A) permit LSC and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the
Buyer Closing Statement and BuyerÂ’s calculation of Net Working Capital,
Assumed Expenses, and Seller Tax Amount, and provide LSC with copies thereof
and (B) provide LSC and its Representatives reasonable access to BuyerÂ’s
executive officers and accountants (subject to compliance with the
accountantsÂ’ customary procedures for release and subject to any limitations
that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable attorney-client
privilege, protect any proprietary or confidential information, or comply with
third-party confidentiality obligations). If LSC disagrees with the
computation of the Net Working Capital, Assumed Expenses or Seller Tax
Amount reflected on the Buyer Closing Statement, LSC shall, within 30 days
after receipt of the Buyer Closing Statement, deliver a notice (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth LSCÂ’s calculation of the Net
Working Capital, Assumed Expenses and Seller Tax Amount. If LSC does not
deliver the Objection Notice to Buyer within 30 days after receipt by LSC of
the Buyer Closing Statement, then Net Working Capital, Assumed Expenses, and
the Seller Tax Amount, specified in the Buyer Closing Statement will be
conclusively presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will be final
and binding upon the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
to the extent that the Buyer Closing Statement or the Objection Notice
corrects a manifest error that was utilized in the determination of the Net
Working Capital, then the Net Working Capital shall be appropriately increased
or decreased to reflect the correction of such error. LSC and Buyer will
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
disagreements as to the computation of the Net Working Capital, Assumed
Expenses, and the Seller Tax Amount, in good faith, but if they do not obtain
a final resolution, then all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted
to a nationally recognized independent public accounting, financial services,
valuation or consulting firm (the " _Neutral Auditors_ ") mutually selected by
LSC and Buyer. LSC and Buyer will direct the Neutral Auditors to render a
determination within 45 days of its retention and LSC and Buyer will cooperate
with the Neutral Auditors during their engagement. The Neutral Auditors will
consider only those items and amounts on the Buyer Closing Statement set
forth in the Objection Notice which LSC and Buyer are unable to resolve;
_provided_ , that each of LSC and Buyer shall be entitled to make a
presentation to the Neutral Auditors regarding the items and amounts
that they are unable to resolve. In making its determination, the Neutral
Auditors shall (i) be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the definitions of Net Working Capital, Assumed
Expenses, and Seller Tax Amount, and the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_,
and (ii) not assign any value with respect to a disputed amount that is
greater than the highest value for such amount claimed by either LSC or Buyer
or that is less than the lowest value for such amount claimed by LSC or
Buyer. Absent fraud or manifest error, the determination of the Neutral
Auditors will be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and Buyer. Buyer and
Sellers shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Auditors in
inverse proportion to the aggregate amount in dispute for which each of them
is successful.

 



-26- 

    

(c) Upon the date of the final determination in accordance with the terms
of _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ (the " _Final Determination Date_ ") of (i) Net
Working Capital as of the Reference Time (" _Final Net Working Capital_ "),
(ii) Assumed Expenses Amount as of the Reference Time (" _Final Assumed
Expenses Amount_ ") and (iii) the Seller Tax Amount as of the Reference Time
(the " _Final Seller Tax Amount_ "), Buyer shall calculate the Final Cash
Consideration Cap and Final Cash Consideration using the Final Net Working
Capital, Final Assumed Expenses Amount and Final Seller Tax Amount.

 

(d) In the event that there is a Deficiency Amount, the Estate Holdback
Amount shall be equal to the Deficiency Amount unless the Debtors determine,
in good faith and in consultation with AlixPartners, LLP, the financial
advisor to the Debtors, that the Debtors are reasonably likely to be
administratively insolvent ( _i.e_., the Debtors would not be able to pay in
full, in cash, allowed administrative expense claims under Section 503(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code) if the Estate Holdback Amount equals the Deficiency
Amount. In the event the Debtors determine that the Debtors are reasonably
likely to be administratively insolvent if the Estate Holdback Amount equals
the Deficiency Amount, (i) the Sellers shall calculate in good faith and in
consultation with AlixPartners, LLP, the maximum amount that could be the
Estate Holdback Amount and after the holdback of which the Debtors would not
be reasonably likely to be administratively insolvent (the " _Maximum Estate
Holdback Amount_ "), (ii) the Sellers shall provide the calculation of Maximum
Estate Holdback Amount and reasonable support therefor as part of the Seller
Closing Statement and (iii) if the Maximum Estate Holdback Amount is less than
the Estate Holdback Amount, solely to the extent agreed in writing by Buyer
(in its sole discretion), the Maximum Estate Holdback Amount shall be equal
to the Estate Holdback Amount for purposes of this Agreement, and the amount
that the Deficiency Amount exceeds the Estate Holdback Amount (the " _Junior
Claim Amount_ ") shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_.
In lieu of agreeing that the Maximum Estate Holdback Amount shall equal the
Estate Holdback Amount, Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(iv)_. The determination of whether the Debtors are
reasonably likely to be administratively insolvent for purposes hereof shall
be calculated in good faith without taking into account general reserves
or general contingencies, in each case, for unknown or non-specific
liabilities and shall only include allowed administrative expense amounts the
Debtors reasonably expect to pay or cause to be paid.

 

(e) Any amounts Buyer would have been entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7(f)_ to retain up to the Junior Claim Amount, shall instead be paid by the
Debtors to Buyer promptly upon the events giving rise to such entitlement in
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_. The Junior Claim Amount shall be entitled to
administrative expense priority status in the Bankruptcy Proceeding pursuant
to Section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, junior in administrative
expense status only to (i) such obligations granted administrative expense
priority pursuant to the DIP Order, (ii) such obligations that are senior to
(or carved-out from) the administrative expense priority claims granted
pursuant to the DIP Order, and (iii) allowed administrative expense
obligations arising in the ordinary course of the DebtorsÂ’ business, but
shall not be junior to any other administrative expense obligations in the
Bankruptcy Proceeding.

 

(f) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(vi)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_,
Buyer shall be permitted to hold back from the Closing Payment an amount
equal to the Estate Holdback Amount, if any, at the Closing. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_ with respect to the Junior Claim Amount, in the event
that Buyer holds back the Estate Holdback Amount following the Closing, Buyer
shall promptly (but

 



-27- 

    

 in any event within five Business Days) pay to Sellers the following
amounts, up to the Estate Holdback Amount (in the aggregate), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by LSC:

(i) upon the completion of either of the External Deed Transfers as set
forth on Section (a)(i) of _Schedule_ _6.15(a)_ , subject to the proviso
below, an amount equal to the Property Holdback Amount related to the
completion of such action on _Schedule 6.15(b)_ ; and

 

(ii) upon the Final Determination Date, subject to the proviso below, an
amount equal to the greater of (A) (I) the difference between the Final Net
Working Capital, _less_ the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (II) the
difference between the Estimated Assumed Expenses Amount, _less_ the Final
Assumed Expenses Amount, and (B) $0;

_provided_ that, in no event shall the Buyer be obligated to pay amounts under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ in the aggregate that exceed the Estate Holdback
Amount. In the event the External Deed Transfers described on _Schedule
6.15(a)_ with respect to either of the subject properties are not completed
prior to the Outside Conveyance Date, the Buyer shall be entitled to retain
the portion of the Property Holdback Amount related to such property and shall
have no further obligation to pay such amount to Sellers or any other Person.
In the event upon the Final Determination Date, the Estate Holdback Amount
(after giving effect to any previous payments pursuant hereto), exceeds the
amount Buyer is obligated to pay Sellers in clause (ii), then Buyer is
entitled to retain such excess amount and shall have no further obligation to
pay such amount to Sellers or any other Person.

(g) Estimated Net Working Capital, Final Net Working Capital and
the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with _Schedule 2.7_ ,
except that such statements, calculations and determinations shall not include
any purchase accounting or any other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) Sellers and Buyer will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
minimize the Final Assumed Expenses and Final Seller Tax Amount.

(i) Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to keep the
professional advisors to the Ad Hoc Group apprised of the status of matters
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
implementation of any Qualified Holdback Replacement Modification (as defined
in the Credit Bid Support Agreement) shall require SellersÂ’ consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld). If Sellers consent to such Qualified Holdback
Replacement Modification, Sellers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives shall cooperate in good faith to implement such Qualified
Holdback Replacement Modification.

 Section 2.8 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required
to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of any U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Prior to withholding

 



-28- 

    

 any amount, Buyer shall provide written notice to the Seller to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid, together with reasonably sufficient
details regarding the relevant withholding law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Seller.
The Parties shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any available reduction to or exemption from any such withholding
requirement.

 

 _ARTICLE III _

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS_

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding numbered section or subsection of a
Schedule (it being agreed that for the purposes of the representations and
warranties made by Sellers in this Agreement, disclosure of any item in any
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or sub-
section of the Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on its face), Sellers represent and warrant to Buyer as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Closing, as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. Each Seller and each
Transferred Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Seller and each
Transferred Entity has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and, to the
extent such concept applies, is in good standing as a foreign legal entity in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.2 _Transferred Entities_.

 

(a) Part 1 of Schedule 3.2(a) sets forth the designation and par value and
the number of authorized, issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Holdings
B.V. held by LSC Communications Netherlands B.V., a limited liability
organized under the Laws of The Netherlands and the record owner of each such
issued and outstanding Equity Interest (the " _Stock Seller_ "). The Stock
Seller is wholly owned by the Sellers and legally and beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the respective Equity Interests set forth
opposite its name in Part 2 of Schedule 3.2(a) free and clear of any Liens,
except with regard to restrictions arising under or in connection with the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities Laws. Each Transferred
Entity legally or beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
respective Equity Interests set forth opposite its name in Part 3 of Schedule
3.2(a) free and clear of any Liens, except for restrictions arising under or
in connection with the Securities Act or any other applicable securities Laws
(including state securities and "blue sky" Laws). The Equity Interests
identified on _Schedule 3.2(a)_ constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding
securities of the Transferred Entities and Sellers have good and valid title
to such Equity Interests.

 



-29- 

    

(b) All the Transferred Interests have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
or other similar right. There are no outstanding options, warrants, rights of
conversion, exchange or purchase or any similar rights in respect of any
Transferred Interests. There are no agreements or understandings outstanding
with respect to the issuance, voting, sale or transfer of any of the
Transferred Interests (except for this Agreement). Sellers have full right,
power and authority to transfer and deliver to Buyer good and valid title to
the Transferred Interests, free and clear of all Liens, except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws.

 

(c) No Transferred Entity owns, beneficially, directly or indirectly, any
Equity Interests of any Person other than all of the respective Equity
Interests set forth opposite its name in Part 2 of _Schedule 3.2(a)_. No
Transferred Entity has any obligation to contribute capital to, or loan any
amounts to, or acquire equity securities of, any Person that is not
a Subsidiary.

(d) All of the Equity Interests associated with the Investments have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and are not subject to,
and have not been issued in violation of, any preemptive or other similar
right. There are no agreements or understandings outstanding with respect to
the issuance, voting, sale or transfer of any of the Equity Interests
associated with the Investments or any securities or other instruments
convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any of
the Equity Interests or debt securities associated with the Investments.
No Seller or any of its Affiliates has any obligation to contribute capital
to, or loan any amounts to, or acquire equity securities of, any Person
relating to an Investment.

 

(e) As of July 31, 2020, except for such Indebtedness as is set forth on
_Schedule 3.2(e)_ , none of the Transferred Entities has any outstanding
Indebtedness. Since July 31, 2020, any Indebtedness incurred by the
Transferred Entities has been incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business and
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business (taken as
whole).

has any assets used in, or Related to the Business.

action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
it is or will become a party; and

(b) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Seller
and, assuming due execution and delivery by Buyer, will constitute a valid and
binding agreement of each Seller, enforceable against each Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject, in the case of any Seller that is not a
Debtor, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect
of general principles of equity (the " _Equitable Exception_ ").

performance by any Seller of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
the Business (taken as a whole) or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (x)

any violation of or default (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
under, require a consent, notice, authorization or approval under, or give

provisions, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under (i) any

Material Contract or Transferred Lease, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_
and  _(iii)_ above, for any such creation of any Lien, breach, violation,

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent or
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Leased Property, collectively, the " _Leased Property_ "), specifying the
address and any other information necessary to identify all such Transferred
Entity Leased Property. (i) Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, none of the Sellers nor the Transferred Entities
are in default under the Transferred Leases or the leases for the Transferred
Entity Leased Property (collectively with the Transferred Leases, the "
_Leases_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any default directly
arising due to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial
condition of the Sellers), (ii) no written notice of any default under any
material Leases (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any default
directly arising due to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceeding or the

 or received by any Seller or Transferred Entity, and (iii) except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no conditions or
circumstances exist which, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or
both, would constitute a default or breach under the Leases (for the avoidance
of doubt, not including any default directly arising due to the commencement
of the Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial condition of the Sellers). The
Leases are in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, except as
may be limited by the Equitable Exception, and no event has occurred
which constitutes, or which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute, a breach or default by any Seller or Transferred Entity (or to
SellersÂ’ Knowledge, any other party thereto) of its obligations under any of
the Leases (for the avoidance of doubt, not including with respect to the
Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial condition of the Sellers), except in
each case for those breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business (taken
as a whole). Sellers have made available to Buyer true and complete copies of
all Leases, to the extent such Leases are in the possession of Sellers.

 

(c) To the Knowledge of Sellers, Sellers or the Transferred Entities, as
applicable, have exclusive possession of each parcel of the Owned Property
and the Leased Property, other than (i) any occupancy rights granted to third-
party owners, tenants or licensees set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)(iii)_ and
(ii) any occupancy rights granted to third-party owners, tenants or licensees
in the Ordinary Course for less than a material portion of any Owned Property
or Leased Property. To the SellersÂ’ Knowledge, (A) there is no existing breach
or default (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any default directly
arising due to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial
condition of the Sellers) by any party under any easements, restrictive
covenants or similar instruments affecting the Owned Property which breach
or default has not yet been cured, (B) no Seller nor any Transferred Entity
has received written notice of any default (for the avoidance of doubt, not
including any default directly arising due to the commencement of the
Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial condition of the Sellers), under any
easements, restrictive covenants or similar instruments affecting the Owned
Property which default has not yet been cured, and (C) there does not exist
any condition or event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute such a breach or default (for the avoidance of
doubt, not including any default directly arising due to the commencement of
the Bankruptcy Proceeding or the financial condition of the Sellers), under
any easements, restrictive covenants or similar instruments affecting the
Owned Property, in each case, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of any conflict or inconsistency between the representations and
warranties made by Sellers in this _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ with respect to the
Owned Property and the Leased Property and the representations and warranties
made by Sellers in  _Article_ __ _ III_ (other than this _Section_ __ _
3.7_), this _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ shall prevail.

Section 3.9 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers and the Transferred Entities are, and since January

applicable to the Business or the Transferred Assets, in each case, except for
violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

or (ii) any material noncompliance with any applicable Laws which
noncompliance has not been cured, in each case, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Seller and Transferred Entity has obtained and is in
compliance with all Permits and Orders issued or granted by a Governmental

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Transferred Entities of the FCPA or any other U.S. or foreign Law concerning
anti-corruption or anti-bribery applicable to the Sellers, the Transferred
Entities or the Business. In the past five years, no Seller or Transferred
Entity, nor any of their directors or officers or, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, their employees, or any other Person acting on their behalf, has, in
connection with the Business, corruptly paid, offered, promised, or authorized
the payment of money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any
foreign official (as such term is defined in the FCPA). Each Seller and each
Transferred Entity has devised and maintains a system of internal controls
designed to provide reasonable assurances that it is in compliance with the
FCPA and any other U.S. or foreign Law concerning anti-corruption or anti-
bribery applicable to the Sellers, the Transferred Entities or the Business.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2018, none of Sellers, the Transferred Entities nor

Transferred Entities are in compliance with all applicable Export/Import Laws
and Sanctions Laws, in each case, except as would not, individually or in the

schedules and annexes thereto, from the Financing Sources, pursuant to which
such Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide the amount of debt financing stated therein
(collectively, the " _Financing_ ").

(c) There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than those expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, there are no agreements, side letters, arrangements or understandings
that would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) impair the enforceability

other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms (subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, preferential transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law)). The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect,
and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure
to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Buyer or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, any other party thereto, under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any manner, the

withdrawn, modified or rescinded and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, no such
amendment, restatement, modification, waiver, termination, withdrawal or
rescission is contemplated (other than to add or replace lenders, financial
institutions, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar

date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the

their Affiliates and their and their respective officers and directors to,
and will cause their other Representatives to, (i) promptly cease and
terminate all solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any Person
(other than Buyer and its Affiliates) that would be prohibited by this

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
5.1_, prior to the entry of the Sale Order, if Debtors receive a _bona fide_
written proposal related to a Competing Transaction (an " _Alternative
Proposal_ ") that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_,
Debtors and their Representatives may, in all cases subject to compliance with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_, communicate with such Person solely to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof in order to determine whether such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be likely to result in a
Superior Proposal. Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Buyer of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal and in connection
with such notice, shall specify the material terms thereof (including, if
applicable, by providing copies of any written requests, proposals, letters of
intent or offers, including proposed agreements), and provide the identity of
the Person making such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry (including,
if known, each of its beneficial owners and controlling persons).

 



-54- 

    

(c) If, prior to the entry of the Sale Order, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its Consulting Professionals, that (i)
such Alternative Proposal is or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (ii) the failure to take the actions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ would be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then LSC may (A) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any such Person and its Representatives that has made such
Superior Proposal, (B) furnish to such Person information relating to the
Debtors pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality
provisions that are no less favorable to the Sellers than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (C) subject to compliance with _Section_
__ _ 5.1(d)_ below, authorize, adopt, or approve such Superior Proposal and
cause or permit the Sellers to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ in order to simultaneously enter into an agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");
_provided_ , that in the case of each of _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , LSC shall
promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours) provide written notice thereof to
Buyer.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_,
prior to the entry of the Sale Order, the Company Board may effect a Change
of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such actions may be taken

of Intended Recommendation Change_ ") to Buyer of the DebtorsÂ’ intention to
make a Change of Recommendation __ at least five Business Days in advance of
taking such actions, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
description of the material terms and conditions of the Alternative Proposal
received by the Sellers that constitutes a Superior Proposal, including a copy
of the acquisition agreement with respect to such Alternative Proposal and any
other proposed transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the party
making such Alternative Proposal; (ii) after providing such notice and prior
to terminating this Agreement, Debtors shall have negotiated, and shall have
caused their Representatives to negotiate, with Buyer and its Representatives
in good faith during such five Business Day period to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
as would result in such Alternative Proposal not constituting a Superior
Proposal; (iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
changes to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents that may be
offered in writing by Buyer by 5:00 p.m. prevailing Eastern time on the last
Business Day of the period described in the foregoing clause (ii); and (iv)
following the expiration of such five Business DaysÂ’ notice period, the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
the Consulting Professionals, that the Alternative Proposal received by the
Debtors would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes
offered in writing by Buyer were given effect and that the failure to take the
actions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ continue to be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any material amendment to the terms of any
Superior Proposal (and, in any event, including any amendment to any price
term thereof or the form of consideration payable in connection therewith),
shall require delivery of a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change and
compliance with the five Business DaysÂ’ period described in this _Section_ __
_ 5.1(d)_.

assets under a Competing Transaction, Sellers may select Buyer as an Alternate
Bidder (as defined in the Bid Procedures) or may select another Alternate
Bidder as provided in the Bid Procedures. Buyer hereby agrees
and acknowledges that it shall serve as an Alternate Bidder if so requested.

thereof for BuyerÂ’s review and comment. Each Seller shall promptly provide

orders of the Bankruptcy Court that such Seller has in its possession (or
receives) pertaining to the Sale Order, or any other order related to any of

(vi) enter into agreements, including with the relevant Governmental
Entity, giving effect to the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_ ;

_provided_ , that any actions taken in connection with this  _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)_ are to be conditioned upon and become effective only from and after
the Closing.

 

Section 6.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, stamp, transfer, motor vehicle
registration, sales, use, value added, excise and other similar non-income
Taxes and all filing and recording fees (and any penalties and interest
associated with such Taxes and fees) arising from or relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Buyer, regardless of the Party on whom
liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer will consult and cooperate in
timely preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as
may be required to comply with the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes, and will cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any available refunds for or exemptions from such Transfer
Taxes, including preparing exemption certificates and other instruments as are
applicable to claim available exemptions from the payment of Transfer Taxes
under applicable Law and executing and delivering such affidavits and forms
as are reasonably requested by the other Party.

(b) _Asset Taxes_. Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(other than Taxes that are Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.3(a)(xiv)_) and Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for any
period or portion thereof that begins after the Closing Date. For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related
to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than such
Asset Taxes described in _clause (ii)_ ), shall be allocated to the period in
which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (ii) Asset
Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date by prorating each such
Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in
such Straddle Period that occur after the Closing Date, on the other hand. To
the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time an
adjustment or determination is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax (and
the Seller Asset Tax Amount) pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_, the Parties
(and, notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, the Neutral Auditors) shall
utilize the most recent information available in estimating in good faith the
amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment or determination.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Seller has prepaid or deposited
any amounts of any Asset Taxes on prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
receive credit for such amounts in determining payments of Asset Taxes.
Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax
Returns and the payment to the applicable Governmental Entity of all Asset
Taxes that become due and payable after the Closing Date. Sellers shall be
responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax

 



-63- 

    

 Returns and payment to the applicable Governmental Entities of all Asset
Taxes that become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_
that any such Asset Taxes paid by Seller to the applicable Governmental
Entity will not be included in calculating the Final Seller Tax Amount.

 

(c) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than 90
days thereafter, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)(iii)_, Buyer will
prepare and deliver to Sellers, an allocation schedule setting forth the
amounts to be allocated among Sellers and among the Transferred Assets of each
Seller, pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to comply with) Section 1060
of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder (or, if
applicable, any similar provision under state, local or foreign Law or
regulation) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_ "). Sellers will have 20
Business Days following delivery of the Proposed Allocation Statement during
which to notify Buyer in writing (an " _Allocation Notice of Objection_ ") of
any objections to the Proposed Allocation Statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of their objections. If Sellers fail to deliver an
Allocation Notice of Objection in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.4(c)(i)_, the Proposed Allocation Statement will be conclusive and binding
on all Parties and will become the " _Final Allocation Statement_." If Sellers
submit an Allocation Notice of Objection, then for 20 Business Days after the
date Buyer receives the Allocation Notice of Objection, Buyer and Sellers
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the allocations. If
Buyer and Sellers agree on the allocations, such revised allocations will
become the Final Allocation Statement. Failing such agreement within 20
Business Days of such notice, the unresolved allocations will be submitted to
an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreeable to
Buyer and Sellers, which firm will be instructed to determine its
best estimate of the allocation schedule based on its determination of the
unresolved allocations (and as set forth in the last sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)(i)_) and provide a written description of the basis for
its determination within 45 Business Days after submission, such written
determination to be final, binding and conclusive. The allocations determined
by such accounting firm (or those on the Proposed Allocation Statement to the
extent Sellers did not object) will be conclusive and binding on all Parties
and will become the "Final Allocation Statement." The fees and expenses of
such accounting firm will be apportioned 50% to Sellers and 50% to Buyer. For
the avoidance of doubt, in administering any Action, the Bankruptcy Court
shall not be required to apply the Final Allocation Statement in determining
the manner in which the Purchase Price should be allocated as between Sellers
and their respective estates. The allocations on the Final Allocation
Statement (however finally determined) shall be consistent with the allocation
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)(iii)_, except as Buyer and Sellers,
cooperating in good faith, otherwise mutually agree. 

(ii) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)(iii)_, except to the extent
otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or by applicable Law, Sellers and Buyer and their respective
Affiliates will report, act and file Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation
Statement and neither Sellers nor Buyer will take any position (whether in
audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final
Allocation Statement.

 



-64- 

    

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, including
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ (x) Buyer shall have the unilateral right to
allocate the Purchase Price for the purpose of calculating the Transfer Taxes
described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ with respect to the Transferred Owned
Property and (y) Buyer shall provide written notice to Sellers no later than
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date of BuyerÂ’s Purchase Price
allocation to such Transferred Owned Property for Transfer Tax purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , (A) no such Purchase Price allocation shall result in
a change to the Purchase Price and (B) such Purchase Price allocation shall be
proposed for a valid business purpose and reasonably consistent with the
facts and value of the Transferred Owned Property. To the extent required by
Law, each Seller of its respective Transferred Owned Property shall execute
any applicable Transfer Tax return containing such allocation in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_.

 

(d) _Cooperation and Audits_. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate fully with
each other regarding Tax matters and will make available to the other as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
with regard to the Transferred Entities, Transferred Assets and Continuing
Employees until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or
extension thereof or the conclusion of all audits, appeals or litigation with
respect to such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _
6.4(d)_ to the contrary, Sellers, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall
not be required to provide to Sellers and their Affiliates or Buyer and its
Affiliates, as the case may be, any records, Tax Returns or any other
information related to Taxes, in each case, to the extent such records, Tax
Returns, or other information do not relate to the Transferred Entities,
Transferred Assets or Continuing Employees.

 

Section 6.5 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) From time to time following the date hereof (and not later than five
Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date), to the extent necessary,
Sellers shall update the Scheduled Employees Schedule to reflect any
terminations, whether such employee has been given notice of termination (if
so, specifying the proposed termination date) or any other changes thereto
permitted by this Agreement. Sellers shall provide Buyer with any such
updated Scheduled Employees Schedule at least ten Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date. Buyer may add Seller Employees to the Scheduled
Employees Schedule by providing written notice of such additions to Sellers
not later than five Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date.

(b) 

 

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.5(b)(i)_ (which schedule shall be
provided by Buyer to Sellers no later than five Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date) (the Scheduled Employees set forth on _Schedule
6.5(b)(i)_ , the " _Non-Offer Employees_"), no later than five Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date (or two Business Days after a Scheduled
Employee is added to the Scheduled Employees Schedule if later), Buyer shall,
in consultation with Sellers, offer employment in writing to each of
the Scheduled Employees who are not Non-Offer Employees (such Scheduled
Employees, the " _Offer Employees_ "), and Sellers shall terminate the
employment of each such Offer Employee, each effective as of the Closing
Date. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall make offers of employment in
writing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(ii)_ to substantially all of
the Scheduled Employees, whether salaried or hourly, other than any Scheduled
Employees with a primary work location at any plants that are Excluded Assets.

 



-65- 

    

(ii) Each offer of employment to any Offer Employee who is not a member of
a labor union shall include (A) the same or substantially similar position and
work location as provided by Sellers to such Offer Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date, (B) base salary (and base wages), target annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary (and base wages), target
annual cash incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities
provided by Sellers to such Offer Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date (excluding any transaction or retention bonuses and equity-based
compensation arrangements) and (C) eligibility for employee benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits made
available to similarly-situated employees of Buyer (excluding pension,
severance and retiree health or welfare benefits) (the " _Minimum_ __ _ Terms
of Employment_"); _provided_ that, solely with respect to the Scheduled
Employees who are Decommissioned Plant Employees, to the extent that (x)
adequate notification under the WARN Act has been given by the Sellers prior
to the Closing Date in compliance with all requirements under the WARN Act,
as applicable, and (y) notice of the applicable termination date has not been
given by the Sellers to such Decommissioned Plant Employees prior to the
Closing Date, each offer of employment to such Decommissioned Plant Employees
shall include severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits provided by Sellers that such employee is eligible to receive under
the LSC Communications US, LLC Amended and Restated LSC Separation Pay Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) No later than two Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date,
Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a list identifying each Offer Employee who has
then accepted BuyerÂ’s offer of employment (each Offer Employee who accepts
such offer on or prior to the Closing Date and commences employment with
Buyer, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") and a list identifying each Offer Employee
who has then rejected BuyerÂ’s offer of employment. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer shall not be obligated to provide any severance, separation pay or
other payments or benefits to (i) any Scheduled Employee or Offer Employee to
whom Buyer offered employment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ above
who does not become a Continuing Employee or (ii) any Decommissioned Plant
Employees to the extent that notice of the applicable termination date has
been given by the Sellers to such Decommissioned Plant Employees prior to the
Closing Date, and such benefits (if any) shall remain obligations of Sellers.

(d) Buyer agrees that the employment of the Continuing Employees who are
not members of a labor union (" _Non-Union Continuing Employees_") who remain
employed by Buyer or its Affiliates shall, during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the
Closing Date and (ii) December 31, 2021, be on terms no less favorable than
the Minimum Terms of Employment. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Buyer or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Non-Union Continuing Employees
and their eligible dependents to the extent waived or satisfied by such Non-
Union Continuing Employee and eligible dependents under a comparable Seller
Plan as of the Closing Date, (B) give each Non-Union Continuing Employee
credit for the plan year in which

 



-66- 

    

 the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for
which payment has been made and (C) give each Non-Union Continuing Employee
service credit for such Non-Union Continuing EmployeeÂ’s employment with
Sellers since such Non-Union Continuing EmployeeÂ’s date of hire with Sellers
(as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(b)_ ) for purposes of vesting (other than for
purposes of any new equity-based compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement), vacation accrual and severance benefit determination and
eligibility to participate under each applicable benefit plan of Buyer or its
Affiliates, as if such service had been performed with Buyer, except (x) for
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans or retiree health or
welfare plans or for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits, (y) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, or
(z) to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Seller Plan immediately prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates and give
commercially reasonable assistance as Buyer may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the foregoing.

 

(e) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
mutually cooperate in undertaking all reasonably necessary or legally
required provision of information to, or consultations, discussions or
negotiations with, any union or other employee representative body that
represent Continuing Employees.

 

(f) On or as soon as commercially practicable after the Closing Date,
Sellers shall provide to Buyer the number of employees terminated by Sellers
within 90 days prior to the Closing Date at each site of employment and the
number of employees who remain active but who have been on furlough within 90
days prior to the Closing Date (which shall include the date(s) on which the
employees went on furlough). Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
1.3(a)(x)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.4(m)_ with respect to the Decommissioned
Plant Employees, Buyer shall be responsible and pay for any obligation
arising out of the WARN Act, and any similar state and local laws to employees
whose employment is terminated by Buyer on or after the Closing. To the extent
required by Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B 9, QandA 8(c), Buyer shall
perform all obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, or other applicable U.S. Law and the foregoing provisions of the
Code and ERISA with respect to each employee of Sellers who is an
"MandA qualified beneficiary" with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, as such term is defined by Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B 9,
QandA 4\.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Seller Plan or any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) prevent Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from amending or terminating any compensation or benefit plan
of Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Transferred Plan) on or after the
Closing Date, in accordance with their terms or (iii) prevent Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee. No
current or former employee of Sellers or any beneficiary or dependent thereof
is entitled to any third-party beneficiary or other rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or under any other provisions of this Agreement with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any such employee or beneficiary or dependent
by Sellers, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or under any benefit plan
(including any Transferred Plans) which Sellers, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates may maintain.

information being provided to it in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference in their entirety (and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time all
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (other than
those which expressly survive the termination thereof pursuant to its
terms)). If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. Buyer acknowledges and understands that this Agreement, before
it becomes otherwise publicly available, may be publicly filed in the
Bankruptcy Court and further made available by Sellers to prospective bidders
and that, except as prohibited herein, such disclosure will not be deemed to
violate any confidentiality obligations owing to Buyer, whether pursuant to
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise. Sellers
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, all non-public
information relating to the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred
Entities and the Assumed Liabilities, will be valuable and proprietary to

Liabilities, except as required by Law or Order or Bankruptcy Court
requirement, or as otherwise becomes available in the public domain other than
through any action by any Seller in violation of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

Section 6.7 _Publicity_. Except as required by the Bankruptcy Court

Bankruptcy Proceeding and any public disclosure issued by LSC pursuant to its
contractual obligations under any confidentiality agreement or as required by
Law, Buyer and Sellers will not issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

be required in connection with ordinary or required pleadings made by any
Debtor in the Bankruptcy Court or if disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
or Sellers, as applicable, will use its or their commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to
consult with the other Parties with respect to the text of any such required
disclosure; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.7_ shall restrict Buyer and its AffiliatesÂ’ disclosure of information
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, including information related
to BuyerÂ’s determination to enter into this Agreement, to investors or
prospective investors of Buyer or its Affiliates.

applicable Law (including applicable COVID-19 Measures at such time). Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, shall require Buyer to provide access to or
disclose any information that would (x) violate any obligation of
confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof) binding on Buyer or any
of its Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or
waiver of the protection of any attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product privilege or other relevant legal privilege or immunity or (y) result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
applicable Laws related to the exchange of information (in which case, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide access or disclosure of
such information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to result
in a loss or waiver of such privilege).

 

Section 6.9 _Credit Support Agreements_.

 

(a) The Buyer acknowledges that in the conduct of the Business, Sellers and
their Affiliates have entered into letters of credit, guaranty, surety and
other similar obligations relating to obligations of the Business, in each

after the Closing and cannot be assumed, assumed and assigned, or otherwise
used in any manner for the direct or indirect benefit of Buyer or
its Affiliates without the prior written consent of the counterparty to such
Credit Support Arrangement (such counterparty, the " _Surety_ "). To the
extent that Buyer intends to use the Credit Support Arrangements to support or
facilitate business transactions of the Business after the Closing, Buyer
agrees to (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain replacement
Credit Support Arrangements which will be in effect at the Closing or arrange
for itself or one of its Affiliates to be substituted as the obligor thereon
as of the Closing Date or (b) obtain the prior written consent of the Surety.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cash collateralize or otherwise backstop, effective as

but subject to _clause (b)_ below, prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and expense,

Financing Sources and their respective Representatives to evaluate, examine
or audit the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Entities and the Business,
including the current assets, cash management and accounting systems and
policies and procedures relating thereto; (iv) using commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the due diligence investigation of the Financing
Sources to the extent customary and reasonable, including providing reasonable

-71- 

    

 necessary for completion of field exams and audits in connection with the

a waiver, by the Party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought. The
waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,
any amendments, modifications, supplements to or waivers of _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.8(d)_, _Section_ __ _
9.14(a)_ (or any other provision or definition of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment or waiver of such provision or definition, as applicable,
would modify the substance of any such provision) in a manner adverse in any
material respect to the Financing Sources shall require the prior written
consent of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
9.3_, any amendments, modifications, supplements to or waivers of any of:
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the last sentence of

 



-81- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(j)_, the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and this  _Section_ __ _
9.3(c)_ (or any other provision or definition of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of such provision or
definition, as applicable, would modify the substance of any such specified
provision) in a manner adverse in any material respect to the Supporting Term
Loan Lenders and/or the Supporting Noteholders shall require the prior written
consent of Required Supporting Lenders.

 

Section 9.4 _Assignment_.

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including
any exhibit or schedule hereto or thereto) will create or be deemed to create
any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party to this
Agreement, except that (i) the Financing Sources are made express third-party
beneficiaries to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_, _Section_
__ _ 9.8(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ and (ii) the Supporting Term Loan
Lenders and the Supporting Noteholders (whose rights, in each case, shall
only be exercised, pursued or waived through the Required Supporting Lenders)
are made express third-party beneficiaries to the last sentence of _Section_
__ _ 1.5(j)_, the second sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, _Section_ __
_ 1.11_, _Section_ __ _ 2.7(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and _Section_ __ _
9.3(c)_.

 

(b) This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment
of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by
either Sellers or Buyer (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment without the
required consents will be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Buyer may
assign some or all of its rights or delegate some or all of its obligations
hereunder to one or more Affiliates (b) Buyer may collaterally assign its
rights and benefits hereunder or under any of the other Transaction Documents,
in whole or in part, to any of the Financing Sources in connection with the
Financing, and (c) Sellers may assign some or all of their rights or delegate
some or all of their obligations hereunder to successor entities (including
any liquidating trust) pursuant to a chapter 11 plan confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court, in the case of each of _clauses_ __ _ (a)_,  _(b)_ and (
_c)_ above, without any other PartyÂ’s consent. No assignment or delegation of
any obligations hereunder will relieve the Parties of any such obligations.
Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to
Sellers or Buyer will also apply to any such assignee unless the context
otherwise requires.

 

Section 9.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all proceedings incident thereto.

 

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York, and the obligations, rights
and remedies of the Parties shall be determined in accordance with such Laws.

 



-82- 

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereto
agree that any dispute, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim, legal action,
suit, proceeding or controversy of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving or against
a Financing Source arising out of or relating hereto, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the performance thereof, or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles
thereof.

 Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damages would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that damages at law
may be an inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, any Party will
be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such breach, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement without
the necessity of posting bond or other security against it or proving
damages, including specific performance of such covenants, promises or
agreements (including to cause Buyer to consummate the Closing and to make the
payments contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_) or
an Order enjoining a Party from any threatened, or from the continuation of
any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The rights set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ will be in
addition to any other rights which a Party may have at law or in equity
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
respective covenants and obligations of Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

 

Section 9.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury_ __ _ Trial_.

(a) Without limiting any PartyÂ’s right to appeal any order of
the Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims
or disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this
Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) any and all proceedings related to the foregoing will be
filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby
consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court
for such purposes and will receive notices at such locations as indicated in
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Bankruptcy
Proceeding has been closed pursuant to Section 350 of the Bankruptcy Code,
the Parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, or in the 

 



-83- 

    

 event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such Action brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any
other Party in any Action by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service will not be effective until the actual receipt thereof by the Party
being served.

 

(c) Each Party to this Agreement waives any right to trial by jury in any
Action regarding this Agreement or any provision hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and without limiting this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, each of the Parties hereto,
on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates: (i) agrees that it shall
not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to not) bring or support any
Person in any Action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim,
suit or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Sources and their respective current, former or future directors, officers,
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling
persons, Affiliates, employees or representatives (in each case, in such
capacity) in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing commitment
letter or any of the Financing documents, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

shall be negotiated in good faith by the Parties so as to carry out, so far as
may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision, covenant or restriction to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any other jurisdiction and the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants
and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

 Section 9.12 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Parties intend that, under
Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Transferred Assets
shall be free and clear of any encumbrances arising out of bulk transfer
Laws, and the Parties shall take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate
to so provide in the Sale Order. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives compliance by the Parties with "bulk sales," "bulk transfers"
or similar Laws in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 9.13 _Guarantee_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
9.13_, each Guarantor does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee
to Sellers the full, complete and prompt performance and payment if, as and
when due, as the case may be, of the Guaranteed Obligations (as hereafter
defined); _provided_ , that in no event shall each GuarantorÂ’s maximum
aggregate liability under this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ exceed an amount equal to
such GuarantorÂ’s Pro Rata Portion of the Guarantee Cap, and if Buyer does not
pay or perform any of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with their
respective terms, each Guarantor shall immediately and without demand by
Sellers, pay or perform such Guaranteed Obligations as if such Guarantor were
the principal obligor primarily liable for the performance thereof and not as
a mere surety. Sellers may obtain recourse against each Guarantor for the
payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations prior to, concurrently
with, or after any other Action to enforce such Guaranteed Obligations. Each
Guarantor shall be entitled to perform or satisfy the Guaranteed Obligations
pursuant to the same terms and conditions and subject to the same rights and
limitations as are applicable to Buyer under this Agreement and in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Guaranteed_
___Obligations_ " means the due and punctual payment of the Closing Payment
and other monetary obligations to be paid by Buyer at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
GuarantorÂ’s obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ shall be in exchange
for the conveyance by the Sellers of the Transferred Assets and Transferred
Interests to Buyer or Guarantor, as applicable, subject to, and in accordance
with, the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and provided
that the Closing Payment and other monetary obligations to be paid by Buyer
at the Closing are paid. If the Closing occurs in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.3_, the guarantee set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ shall
automatically and simultaneously be extinguished and of no force or effect.
Each Guarantor shall be liable on a several, and not joint, basis for their

 



-86- 

    

 respective Pro Rata Portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. There are no
third-party beneficiaries of the guarantee set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.13_. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
each Guarantor and, assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor,
enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 9.14 _Non-Recourse_. __  

(a) All Actions (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out
or by reason of, be connected with, or related in any manner to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby may be made only against (and are
expressly limited to) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties
hereto (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any Financing Source and any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, equityholder, Affiliate, attorney or
other Representative of a Contracting Party (" _Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall
have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or
granted by statute or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of
an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any Actions, obligations
or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on,
in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement (or the negotiation, execution,
performance or breach thereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby; and,
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party waives and
releases all such Liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
otherwise, none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including without
limitation the Guarantors and their Affiliates, shall have any Liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute or
based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of an entity party
against its owners or Affiliates) for any Actions, obligations or Liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of (i) the failure of the Buyer to deliver the Credit Bid and
Release, including any breach of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.4(a)(i)_ or (ii) any failure by the agent under the Prepetition Credit
Agreement or the trustee under the Prepetition Indenture to effect the Credit
Bid and Release or comply with the direction letters delivered in connection
with the Credit Bid Support Agreement.

 

Section 9.15 _Seller Designation_. Each Seller hereby designates LSC to
execute any and all instruments, certificates or other documents on behalf of
such Seller, and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of such
Seller, which LSC may deem necessary or advisable, or which may be required
pursuant to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or otherwise, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby and the performance of all obligations hereunder or thereunder,
including the exercise of the power to: (a) execute any other Transaction
Document on behalf of such Seller, (b) act for such Seller with respect to any
determination of the Purchase Price under this Agreement, (c) give and receive
notices and communications to or from Buyer relating to this Agreement, any
other Transaction Document or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby, (d) agree

 



-87- 

    

 to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and compromises
of, demand arbitration or litigation of, and comply with orders of arbitrators
or courts with respect to, any dispute between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, in each case relating to this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated
hereby or thereby, (e) grant any waiver, consent or approval, or election,
and making any filings with any Governmental Entity, on behalf of such Seller
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, and (f) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of LSC for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. LSC shall have the authority and power
to act on behalf of each other Seller with respect to the disposition,
settlement or other handling of all claims under this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document and all rights or obligations arising hereunder or
thereunder. Each Seller shall be bound by all actions taken and documents
executed by LSC in connection with this Agreement and any other Transaction
Document, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of
LSC. The appointment of LSC as each other SellerÂ’s attorney-in-fact revokes
any power of attorney heretofore granted that authorized any other Person or
Persons to represent any such Seller with regard to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document. The appointment of LSC as attorney-in-fact
pursuant hereto is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

extent Atlas has  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 6 -

         |  provided such consent, such Supporting Lender shall be deemed
an "Equity Supporting Lender" for purposes hereof). The " _Equity Percentage
Cap_ " means 25.0%; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Equity
Supporting Lenders shall only be permitted to purchase Series B Preferred in
an amount equal to their respective pro rata portion of the Initial Payment
Amount, and subject to any distributions under Section 1(i), their respective
pro rata portion of such distributions. Proceeds from the private placement of
Series B Preferred will be used to redeem or repurchase the corresponding

Call and effecting the _pro rata_ distribution of the Initial Payment Amount
and any _pro rata_ distribution in accordance with Section 1(i) below, in cash

affiliate thereof shall have any obligation to provide any Supporting Lender,
Prepetition Term Loan Lender or Prepetition Noteholder any opportunity or
right to participate in the NewCo Equity Investment or otherwise purchase
securities of NewCo (other than as otherwise set forth in the New Equity Term

opportunity or right.

Supporting Lender to participate in the NewCo Equity Investment shall be
subject to such Equity Supporting Lender owning the amount of claims set forth

NewCo shall provide written notice of the Final Determination to the other
Parties hereto, which written notice shall set forth the calculation of the
Final Available Amount. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and
Prepetition Noteholders _pro rata_ based on their respective Available NewCo
Interests at the Closing. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

In the event that the Final Available Amount is greater than the Available
Amount (such excess amount, the " _Available Amount Excess_ "), then,
promptly following the Final Determination (and, in any event, within five
Business Days), (I) NewCo shall pay an amount equal to the Final Determination
Holdback by wire transfer of immediately available funds in cash to the
Paying Agent for distribution to the Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and

Interests at the Closing and (II) NewCo shall pay an amount in cash equal to

the Paying Agent for distribution to the Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and
Prepetition Noteholders _pro rata_ based on their respective Available NewCo

Business Days), NewCo shall (A) pay an amount equal to the Final Determination
Holdback less the Available Amount Deficiency (which amount shall not be less

Prepetition Noteholders _pro rata_ based on their respective Available NewCo
Interests at the Closing, and (B) retain the Available Amount Deficiency

redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any equity
interests or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for any equity interests of NewCo, in each case other than as contemplated by
this Agreement, or (C) issue, deliver or sell any additional equity interests
or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any
equity interests of NewCo that are (or would be) subject to the preemptive
right of the Series B Preferred unless provisions are made such that promptly
after the private placement of any Series B Preferred in accordance with this
Agreement, the Equity Supporting Lenders that are issued such Series
B Preferred are provided with the opportunity to participate in such issuance
as if such Equity Supporting Lender held its respective Series B Preferred at
the time of the subject issuance, delivery or sale. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) |

Promptly following the completion of either of the External Deed Transfers as
set forth in Section (a)(i) of Schedule 6.15(a) of the Purchase Agreement
(and, in any event, within five Business Days), NewCo shall pay an amount
equal to the Property Holdback Amount (to the extent such amount is part of
the Available Amount Holdback) related to the completion of such action on
Schedule 6.15(b) by wire transfer of immediately available funds in cash to
the Paying Agent for distribution to the Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and
Prepetition Noteholders _pro rata_ based on their respective Available NewCo
Interests at the Closing. In the event the External Deed Transfers described
on _Schedule 6.15(a)_ with respect to either of the subject properties are not

property and shall have no further obligation to pay such amount to Sellers,

     | (j) |

_Holdback Replacement Proposal_. 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 9 -

         | (i) |

The Required Supporting Lenders may propose that the Available Amount Holdback
be replaced with an obligation that LSC pay Buyer or NewCo an amount equal to
the amount of the Available Amount Holdback that would be retained by Buyer
and NewCo upon the Final Determination Date (and with respect to the Property
Holdback, the Outside Conveyance Date), which obligation is supported by a
letter of credit issued pursuant to the DIP Financing or other credit support
(such as cash collateral or an escrow funded account) funded under or issued
pursuant to the DIP Financing (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified to effect such credit support) in an amount sufficient to pay any and
all such amounts to Buyer or NewCo promptly when due (a " _Holdback
Replacement Proposal_ "). NewCo shall consider in good faith any Holdback
Replacement Proposal reasonably made by the Required Supporting Lenders, but
in no event shall NewCo be required to accept or agree to any such Holdback
Replacement Proposal; provided that, if such Holdback Replacement Proposal
is no less favorable to NewCo relative to its rights to the Available Amount
Holdback pursuant to this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, must
include that the funds are immediately accessible) then NewCoÂ’s acceptance and
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, further, that if
NewCo does accept or agree to a Holdback Replacement Proposal then NewCo
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate in implementing
such Holdback Replacement Proposal without any cost to NewCo or its
Affiliates (other than with respect to the fees of their respective financial
and legal advisors). In the event that NewCo or Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Required Supporting Lenders, on the other hand, enter into a written
agreement with respect to a Holdback Replacement Proposal that expressly
provides that such Holdback Replacement Proposal is a "Qualified Holdback
Replacement Modification", such Holdback Replacement Proposal as set forth
therein shall be a " _Qualified Holdback Replacement Modification_ " and,
subject to implementation of such Qualified Holdback Replacement Modification
by the parties to the Purchase Agreement, the Available Amount Holdback shall
be deemed zero (and the components thereof shall be deemed zero) or such
amount or formula set forth in the Qualified Holdback Replacement Modification
in respect thereof.

terms, (iii) the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, (iv) the date of the completion of the Auction where the Joint Bid is
determined not to be the Successful Bid or Alternate Bid (each as defined in

of this Section 2(a) in any material respect if the Funds were a  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 10 -

         |  party to this Agreement for purposes of this Section 2(a), the
Parties shall not, and shall direct their respective representatives not, to
directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers from, any discussions or negotiations with, or
enter into any agreements, arrangements, commitments or understandings
(whether or not legally binding) with, any person or entity relating to, or
that could reasonably result in, any merger, acquisition, divestiture, sale of
material assets or equity, business combination, recapitalization, joint
venture, or other extraordinary transaction directly or indirectly involving
the equity, voting power or all or a material portion of the DebtorsÂ’ assets
or any other similar transaction that would serve as an alternative to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such transaction, an "
_Alternative Transaction_ "); provided, however, that in the event the Joint
Bid is selected as the Alternate Bid, the Supporting Lenders shall be free to
discuss any distributions to such lenders in their respective capacities as
Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and Prepetition Noteholders under the terms of
the Successful Bid. NewCo, Atlas, the Atlas Lenders and the Supporting Lenders
shall immediately terminate or cause to be terminated any such discussions or
negotiations that may be ongoing, other than with the Parties hereto. The
Supporting Lenders shall promptly notify NewCo, Atlas and the Atlas Lenders in
writing of any approach, expressions of interest, offer or inquiry made by any
third party to the Supporting Lenders or their representatives regarding an
Alternative Transaction, and vice versa. 
---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Successful Bid_. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the written
direction letters referred to in Sections 1(b)(i) and 1(b)(ii) hereof, the
Parties agree that, in the event that the Joint Bid is determined to be the
Successful Bid and subject to delivery and effectiveness of the Credit Bid and
Release, all Prepetition Term Loan Lenders and Prepetition Noteholders shall
receive distributions in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of
NewCo under this Agreement to make distributions to the Prepetition Term Loan
Lenders and Prepetition Noteholders are subject to receipt and effectiveness
of the Credit Bid and Release.

antitrust filings. The Parties shall not take any actions inconsistent with
this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, and any other related documents
executed by the Parties. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to execute, acknowledge and deliver in proper form any further documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and take such other

this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

_Limitations_. Section 2(a) shall terminate solely with respect to the
Supporting Lenders if Atlas or any of its Representatives purport to
materially alter, or notify the Supporting Lenders (or their Representatives)
that they may seek to materially alter, the Joint Bid in a manner that is not
permitted by Section 8 of this Agreement. Except with respect to an
Alternative Transaction, nothing in this Section 2 shall limit or restrict any
discussions between or among one or more of the Prepetition Term Loan Lenders
and Prepetition Noteholders and their respective Representatives.  

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

Each Atlas Lender and Supporting Lender irrevocably consents to and approves the Joint Bid. 

 

6. Due Authorization; No Conflict; Third Party Consents. Each Party hereto has all right, power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority and has taken all organizational action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Each Supporting Lender 

 



\- 13 -

    

 hereby represents that (i) it is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ ") and (ii) none of the "bad actor" disqualifying
events described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i)-(viii) promulgated under the Securities
Act is applicable to such Supporting Lender or any of its Rule 506(d) Related
Parties.

 

7. Assignment; Transfer Restrictions. Each Supporting Lender and Atlas Lender shall not sell, assign, grant, transfer, convey, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of (each, a " _Transfer_ ") any claim, unless such Transfer is to (a) a controlled Affiliate of such Supporting Lender or Atlas Lender or (b) another Supporting Lender, Atlas Lender or any other Prepetition Term Loan Lender or Prepetition Noteholder, as the case may be, that, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any Transfer, executes and delivers to the Parties a signature page to this Agreement. Any Transfer made in violation of this Section 7 shall be deemed null and void _ab initio_ and of no force or effect, regardless of any prior notice provided to any Party, and shall not create any obligation or liability of any other Party to the purported transferee. 

8. Amendments, Modifications, Waivers. This Agreement may only be modified, amended or supplemented, and any of the terms hereof may only be waived, with the written consent (email shall suffice) of NewCo, the Atlas Lenders and the Required Supporting Lenders; _provided_ , that (x) any such action that disproportionately affects a Supporting Lender relative to the other Supporting Lenders shall require the consent of such affected Supporting Lender and (y) NewCoÂ’s obligations pursuant to Sections 1(i)(i), 1(i)(v) and 1(i)(vi) may be waived by the Equity Supporting Lenders holding a majority of the claims against the Debtors of all of the Equity Supporting Lenders in the aggregate. NewCo may amend, modify or supplement the Purchase Agreement, including as set forth in Section 1(c), following consultation with the Required Supporting Lenders; provided the Purchase Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of the Required Supporting Lenders if such amendment, modification or supplement (a) adversely affects the distributions or other payments contemplated to be made to or by the Supporting Lenders pursuant to _Sections 1(g)_ or _1(i)_ hereof, (b) otherwise requires the consent of the Required Supporting Lenders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_ of the Purchase Agreement, or (c) is inconsistent with Section 1(f) of this Agreement. 

 

9. Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement may be terminated prior to (or, in the case of Section 9(g), at) the Closing as follows: 



     | (a) |

by the mutual written agreement of the Required Supporting Lenders, the Atlas

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

by the Required Supporting Lenders if this Agreement is modified, amended or
supplemented in a manner not consistent with _Section_ __ _ 8_ hereof;

\- 14 -

         | (e) |

by the Required Supporting Lenders if the Sale Order is not in form and

Court enters the Sale Order in a form that is or contains terms that are not
reasonably acceptable to the Required Supporting Lenders, provided that NewCo
has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement in respect thereof; 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

in the event the Estimated Cash Consideration is not sufficient to satisfy the
obligations specified in Sections 1(e)(i) and 1(e)(ii) hereof as of the

Agreement if requested by the Agent under the Prepetition Revolving Credit
Facility; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

automatically, upon and subject to the Closing if and only if: (i) Buyer is
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Purchase
Agreement; and (ii) none of the Atlas Parties have materially breached their
respective obligations or representations or warranties under this Agreement
prior to the Closing and such breach (if any) proximately caused the failure
of the satisfaction of the condition set forth under Section 7.2(f) of the
Purchase Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 

In the event of termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
void and of no effect and all rights and obligations of the Parties shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect other than the
provisions set forth in Sections 9, 11, 12, 14 and 15 which shall survive;
_provided_ , that nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to release any
Party from liability for any material breach of this Agreement prior to
termination; _provided_ , _further_ that in the event of a termination
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9(g)_, no Party or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any further obligations or Liability (whether in
contract, or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose Liability of any entity party against its
owners or Affiliates) for any Actions, obligations or Liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Purchase Agreement to the
other Parties hereto, any of their respective Affiliates, the Prepetition
Term Loan Lenders or Prepetition Noteholders.

10. Remedies. It is understood and agreed by the Parties that money damages may be an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by any Party and each non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy of any such breach of this Agreement, including an order of the Bankruptcy Court or other court of competent jurisdiction requiring any Party to comply promptly with any of its obligations hereunder. Except with respect to any breach of Sections 5, 6 or 7 hereof (for which Parties shall be entitled to any remedy available at law or at equity), the Parties agree that such relief will be their only remedy against the applicable breaching Party or Parties with respect to any such breach, and that in no event will any Party be liable for monetary damages under or in connection with this Agreement. The Parties hereby agree that all Actions (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be made only by the Parties and not any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no individual Supporting Lender shall be able to assert or make any claim or Action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by 

 



\- 15 -

    

 statute) or otherwise enforce this Agreement, against any Atlas Party;
provided, that any such claim or Action against an Atlas Party may only be
made by the Required Supporting Lenders acting on behalf of such individual
Supporting Lender; and provided, further that, with respect to Section
1(h)(i), such provision shall only be enforced by the Equity Supporting
Lenders holding a majority of the claims against the Debtors of all of
the Equity Supporting Lenders in the aggregate.

12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to such stateÂ’s choice of law provisions which would require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction, except where preempted by the Bankruptcy Code. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees for itself that the Bankruptcy Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

Each of the Parties waives any right to have a jury participate in resolving any dispute, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, between any of the Parties arising out of, connected with, relating to, or incidental to the relationship established between any of them in connection with this Agreement. Instead, any disputes resolved in court shall be resolved in a bench trial without a jury.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements, and understandings, whether written or oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall constitute the same instrument,

electronic mail in portable document format (.pdf). The section headings of
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not, for any
purpose, be deemed a part of this Agreement. This Agreement is the product of
negotiations among the Parties, and the enforcement or interpretation hereof,
is to be interpreted in a neutral manner, and any presumption with regard to
interpretation for or against any Party by reason of that Party having drafted
or caused to be drafted this Agreement or any portion hereof, shall not be
effective in regard to the interpretation hereof.
